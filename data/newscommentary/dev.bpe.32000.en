what we do to share opportunities , meet challenges , and pursue development will be directly relevant not only to our own peoples ’ welfare , but also to the world ’ s future .
we share a commitment to resol@@ ving international issues through political means , and both sides have already played a construc@@ tive role in addressing global challenges such as climate change , terrorism , and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
the parallel launch of china ’ s 12th five-@@ year plan and europe ’ s 2020 strategy has also helped to deep@@ en our cooperation .
china and europe worked together after 2008 to prevent a global financial mel@@ t@@ down , op@@ pose prote@@ c@@ tion@@ ism , and promote reform of the international financial system , thus facili@@ tating worldwide economic recovery .
china also takes its relations with the us very seriously .
indeed , our bil@@ ateral relationship is among the most important in the international community .
that relationship has gone through some rough pat@@ ches since diplo@@ matic ties were established in 1979 , but , overall , it has continued to grow and benefit both sides .
today , china and the us share more interests than ever , and there are encouraging pro@@ spe@@ cts for still broader cooperation .
when president hu j@@ inta@@ o visited washington , dc in january 2011 , he and president barack obama agreed to build what hu referred to as “ a chin@@ a-@@ us cooperative partnership based on respect and mutual benefit . ”
they re@@ affir@@ med their de@@ ference for each other ’ s sovereig@@ n@@ ty and terri@@ torial integrity , and reached agre@@ ements on major strategic issues , including efforts to streng@@ then cooperation in the asi@@ a-@@ pacific region and in multi@@ lat@@ eral institutions , and to respond jo@@ in@@ tly to regional and global challenges to peace and stability , for example , on the korean pen@@ insu@@ la .
china is the world ’ s largest developing country ; europe is the largest blo@@ c of developed countries ; and the us is the largest single developed country .
together , we account for nearly a third of humanity and two-thirds of the world economy .
as the three major global powers , china , the eu , and the us must streng@@ then their cooperation , and must work with the rest of the world to face the complex international issues that challenge us all .
together , we must shoulder the great task of uph@@ olding world peace and promoting common development .
while china is committed to its own independent foreign policy , it cannot achieve development in isolation .
likewise , the world cannot develop without china .
hu once said that the twenty-@@ first century should be a century of peace , development , and cooperation .
china is willing to join with the eu , the us , and the rest of the world to realize the potential of a truly harmon@@ i@@ ous world .
berkeley – unless something unexpected happens , the united states ’ many legis@@ l@@ ated reduc@@ tions in taxes over the past 12 years – all of which have been explicitly temporary – will ex@@ pi@@ re simultaneously at the start of 2013 .
some of these reduc@@ tions were implemented to fight what was seen four years ago as a temporary down@@ turn .
although their suppor@@ ters wanted to make them permanent , cla@@ iming that they were temporary allowed for the circum@@ vention of proce@@ du@@ ral requirements in the leg@@ isla@@ tive process that democrats had created in a va@@ in effort to guarantee fiscal san@@ ity .
the immediate increase in tax rates is only part of the story .
at the same time , automatic reduc@@ tions in the defense budget and “ discre@@ tionary ” domestic spending – agreed to by both democrats and republicans in the summer of 2011 – will take effect .
couple these tax increases and spending cuts with the pro@@ visions of “ ob@@ ama@@ care , ” the us heal@@ th-@@ care reform champi@@ oned by president barack obama , and , as of january 1 , 2013 , america ’ s long-@@ run structural budget deficit disappears .
the restored tax rates will , for the fores@@ ee@@ able future , be sufficient to support the us defense establishment , the growing us soci@@ al-@@ insurance system , and a moder@@ ate – alb@@ eit inadequate and sub@@ optimal – amount of other “ discre@@ tionary ” federal spending .
the us national debt / gdp ratio will be on track to fall from its current level of 75 % to 50 % by 20@@ 35 .
moreover , the us will begin running primary budget sur@@ pl@@ uses – the fiscal balance minus interest payments on existing debt – by 2015 .
so why isn ’ t the prospect of going over the fiscal cliff gre@@ eted with enthusiasm ?
yes , there will be big spending cuts – which will hit defense contra@@ ctors , doctors with medicare patients , and all who benefit from or rely on government discre@@ tionary spending – and substantial tax increases .
but , to balance the budget in the long run , either taxes have to go up or spending has to go down relative to some baseline , or both .
there are two reasons why deficit haw@@ ks are not declar@@ ing victory .
first , many who call themselves deficit haw@@ ks are really spending haw@@ ks : they believe that us social insurance is too generous to the unemployed , the disabled , the elderly , and the sick , and that by far the best policy is to cut back on such programs rather than raise taxes to pay for them .
but , they fear that calling for spending cuts will be un@@ popular , unlike , they hope , demands to balance the budget .
for them , the problem with the fiscal cliff is that it does not cut spending enough and raises taxes too much .
second , and more important for those who worry about the us economy ’ s health , the process is not well-@@ described by the term “ fiscal cliff . ”
it is , rather , an au@@ ster@@ ity bomb that hits an economy in which unemployment remains high , the emplo@@ y@@ ment@@ -to-@@ population ratio remains horri@@ f@@ y@@ ingly low , and there are only fe@@ e@@ ble signs that the large gap between current and potential output is closing .
the past two months ’ run@@ -up to the au@@ ster@@ ity bomb ’ s de@@ ton@@ ation has already reduced projected real gdp growth in 2013 from 3 % to 2.5 % , and has raised likely end-@@ 2013 unemployment from 7.@@ 5 % to 7.@@ 7 % .
each day from january 1 to june 30 that the damage continues will have a roughly linear impact on economic performance in 2013 , reducing the likely full-@@ year real gdp growth rate by 0.@@ 00@@ 84 % – and only if a deal is ultimately reached that would have caused no economic harm in 2013 had it been reached on november 10 , 2012 .
if no deal is reached by june 30 , america ’ s likely 2013 real gdp growth rate will be -@@ 0.@@ 5 % , with the likely unemployment rate returning to 8.@@ 9 % .
spending cuts and tax increases that in the long run restore fiscal san@@ ity and balance are good .
having them all hit a weak , still@@ -@@ depressed economy simultaneously is not good .
thus , us officials face four tasks .
first , republicans and democrats must negotiate a bi@@ partisan agreement to stretch out the spending cuts and tax increases that take effect on january 1 , 2013 .
that way , they will affect the economy gradually over five years , rather than all at once .
second , the federal reserve should expand its quantitative e@@ asing and forward guidance programs .
consumers will be spending less in 2013 , o@@ wing to higher taxes , as will government , which means that someone has to be spending more .
housing construction and exports are the obvious candidates , and both can be boo@@ sted somewhat by more aggressive bal@@ ance@@ -@@ sheet operations by the fed , together with promises of continued low nomin@@ al interest rates and higher inflation in the medium term .
third , the large govern@@ ment-@@ sponsored mortgage enter@@ pris@@ es , fan@@ nie ma@@ e and fre@@ d@@ die mac , should be used as macro@@ econom@@ ic@@ -@@ policy tools to restore housing construction to its long-term trend level .
this should have been done five years ago , but better late than never .
finally , and also five years too late , the us treas@@ ury secretary should announce that while the stron@@ g-@@ dollar doctrine was appropriate ( and in america ’ s interest ) during the dot@@ -@@ com boom , the country needs a weak dollar in the after@@ math of the au@@ ster@@ ity bomb ’ s de@@ ton@@ ation .
reaching the wrong agreement to def@@ use the au@@ ster@@ ity bomb , or cus@@ hi@@ on the economy from its impact , would merely recreate america ’ s long-@@ run structural budget deficit – a very bad outcome .
failure to take all four steps out@@ lined above all but guarante@@ es rene@@ wed recession in america , even if a good agreement is reached on stre@@ tching out the tax hi@@ kes and spending cuts .
and if no agreement is reached on that , under@@ taking the last three steps would at least reduce somewhat the subsequ@@ ent damage .
what communism still teaches us
pra@@ gue - the fif@@ te@@ enth anniversary of the vel@@ vet revolution on november 17 , 1989 , which brought an end to 41 years of communist dictator@@ ship in c@@ ze@@ cho@@ slo@@ v@@ ak@@ ia , is an opportunity to pon@@ der the meaning of moral behavior and free action .
today we live in a democratic society , but many people - not only in the c@@ ze@@ ch republic - still believe that they are not true masters of their destiny .
they have lost faith that they can really influence political developments , much less influence the direction in which our civilization is evolving .
during the communist era , most people believed that individual efforts to effect change did not make sense .
communist leaders insisted that the system was the result of history &apos;s objective laws , which could not be challenged , and those who refused this logic were pun@@ ished - just in case .
unfortunately , the way of thinking that supported communist dictator@@ ships has not disappeared entirely .
some politicians and pun@@ di@@ ts maintain that communism merely collapsed under its own weight - again , o@@ wing to &quot; objective laws &quot; of history .
again , individual responsibility and individual actions are be@@ li@@ tt@@ led . communism , we are told , was only one of the dead ends of western ration@@ alism ; therefore , it was sufficient to wait passi@@ vely for it to fail .
the very same people often believe in other manife@@ stations of inevi@@ tability , such as various supposed laws of the market and other &quot; invisible hands &quot; that direct our lives .
as there is not much space in such thinking for individual moral action , social cri@@ tics are often ridicul@@ ed as naive mor@@ alists or eli@@ ti@@ sts .
perhaps this is one of the reasons why 15 years after the fall of communism , we again witness political a@@ pathy .
democracy is increasingly seen as a mere ritual .
in general , western societies , it seems , are experiencing a certain crisis of the democratic e@@ thos and active citizenship .
it is possible that what we are witn@@ essing is a mere change of paradigm , caused by new technologies , and we have nothing to worry about .
but perhaps the problem is deeper : global corporations , media car@@ tel@@ s , and powerful bureau@@ cra@@ cies are transforming political parties into organizations whose main task is no longer public service , but the protection of specific cli@@ ent@@ eles and interests .
politics is becoming a battle@@ ground for lobby@@ ists ; media trivi@@ alize serious problems ; democracy often looks like a virtual game for consumers , rather than a serious business for serious citizens .
when dreaming about a democratic future , we who were dissi@@ dents certainly had some utop@@ ian illusions , as we are well aware today .
however , we were not mista@@ ken when we argued that communism was not a mere dead end of western ration@@ alism .
bureau@@ cra@@ tization , anonymous manipulation , and emphasis on mass con@@ for@@ mis@@ m were brought to &quot; perfe@@ ction &quot; in the communist system ; however , some of the very same threats are with us today .
we were already certain then that if democracy is emp@@ tied of values and reduced to a competition of political parties that have &quot; guaranteed &quot; solutions to everything , it can be quite un@@ democratic .
this is why we put so much emphasis on the moral dimension of politics and a vibrant civil society as counter@@ wei@@ ghts to political parties and state institutions .
we also dreamed about a more just international order .
the end of the bipolar world represented a great opportunity to make the international order more humane .
instead , we witness a process of economic globalization that has escaped political control and , as such , is causing economic ha@@ vo@@ c as well as ecological deva@@ station in many parts of the world .
the fall of communism was an opportunity to create more effective global political institutions based on democratic principles - institutions that could stop what appears to be , in its current form , the self-@@ destructive tendency of our industrial world .
if we do not want to be over@@ run by anonymous forces , the principles of freedom , equality and solidar@@ ity - the foundation of stability and prosperity in western democracies - must start working globally .
but , above all , it is necessary - just as it was during the communist era - that we not lose faith in the meaning of alternative centers of thought and civic action .
let &apos;s not allow ourselves to be manipulated into believing that attempts to change the &quot; established &quot; order and &quot; objective &quot; laws do not make sense .
let &apos;s try to build a global civil society , and let &apos;s insist that politics is not just a technology of power , but needs to have a moral dimension .
at the same time , politicians in democratic countries need to think seriously about reforms of international institutions , because we desperately need institutions capable of real global governance .
we could start , for example , with the united nations , which , in its current form , is a reli@@ c of the situation shortly after the end of world war ii .
it does not reflect the influence of some new regional powers , while im@@ morally equ@@ ating countries whose representatives are democra@@ tically elected and those whose representatives speak only for themselves or their jun@@ tas , at best .
we , the europeans , have one specific task .
industrial civilization , which now sp@@ ans the whole world , origin@@ ated in europe .
all of its miracles , as well as its terrifying contradi@@ ctions , can be explained as consequences of an e@@ thos that is initially european .
therefore , uni@@ fying europe should set an example for the rest of the world regar@@ ding how to face the various dangers and hor@@ rors that are eng@@ ul@@ fing us today .
indeed , such a task - which is closely tied to the success of european integration - would be an authentic ful@@ fill@@ ment of the european sense of global responsibility . and it would be a much better strategy than cheap@@ ly bl@@ aming america for the contemporary world &apos;s various problems .
what corporate tax for europe ?
the european commission is considering a common model of corporate tax@@ ation for the european union that cannot possibly work .
instead , it should consider a simpler , and more viable , alternative that already exists .
corporate income in the eu is currently tax@@ ed under widely diver@@ gent national rules , based on separate accounting ( sa ) of income earned in each country .
the system is complex , expensive to ad@@ minister , and can result in double tax@@ ation because members usually do not allow full wri@@ te-@@ offs for losses and tax li@@ abilities in@@ cur@@ red abroad .
it is also prone to tax ev@@ asion , o@@ wing to different definitions of corporate income in the member states and the vast opportunities for cheating offered by al@@ p ( since reference market prices often do not exist ) , not to mention prof@@ it-@@ shifting to low-@@ tax jur@@ is@@ dic@@ tions .
the commission is now proposing that eu companies operating in more than one member state be tax@@ ed on a common definition of earned income – the common con@@ soli@@ dated base tax@@ ation ( c@@ c@@ bt ) .
earned income would be calculated on a con@@ soli@@ dated basis for the group and then “ ap@@ por@@ tioned ” among the member states according to a formula reflecting each business unit ’ s contribution to overall group income .
the formula could include such factors as sales , pay@@ roll , and tangible assets , as in canada and the united states , or valu@@ e-@@ added , adju@@ sted to exclu@@ de impor@@ ts in order to measure the valu@@ e-@@ added “ produced ” in each country .
each member state would remain free to decide the tax rate applic@@ able to its portion of group income .
under this approach , tax@@ able income would be determined from the con@@ soli@@ dated accounts based on international accounting standards ( i@@ as ) , which since 2005 have become legally bin@@ ding for eu@@ -@@ listed companies ’ financial reports .
this offers full tax wri@@ te-@@ offs for losses within company groups , and transfer prices would no longer matter .
even so , the commission ’ s proposal has fatal short@@ com@@ ings .
for one thing , the factors included in the ap@@ por@@ tion@@ ment formula would in practice be tax@@ ed at the national rates , creating fresh incentives for fac@@ tor@@ - and prof@@ it-@@ shifting .
but it is two other obstacles that render c@@ c@@ bt hopeless .
first , the i@@ as responds to the information needs of financial investors , but it does not provide a reliable definition of income for tax purposes .
the acc@@ ru@@ al principle typical of financial accounting is in@@ compatible with tax systems ’ realization principle .
moreover , the i@@ as leaves the allo@@ cation of profit and losses to different fiscal years largely un@@ determined , with each member state choosing different solutions .
second , common legal rules on group con@@ soli@@ dation do not exist ; indeed , many eu countries ’ commercial law contains no legal definition of a group .
the attribu@@ tion of companies to a common group would need to be based on legal control , that is , ownership of some defined threshold of equity – 51 % or higher .
but a much lower share of equity often is sufficient to secure de fac@@ to control , thus encouraging groups to adapt their capital structure – moving firms in and out of the group ’ s boundaries – to minimize tax li@@ abilities .
clearly , c@@ c@@ bt is a non-@@ starter .
but this doesn ’ t mean that eu companies are con@@ dem@@ ned to live with 25 different national tax systems .
the idea of a common tax base must be preserved in order to simplify the system and narrow the scope for prof@@ it-@@ shifting .
however , a radical change in approach is required : the notion of income as a basis for corporate tax@@ ation should be scra@@ pped altogether .
refer@@ ring to corporate income made sense when company tax@@ ation was seen as a “ back stop ” within a system of progressive tax@@ ation of personal incomes .
but most countries have now adopted “ du@@ al ” income tax@@ ation that treat the fruits of capital more len@@ i@@ ently than other personal income .
more importantly , the notion of corporate income is inherently arbitrary , for it is based on correct measurement of capital consumption in each tax period , which has become less and less reliable o@@ wing to the increased importance of in@@ tan@@ gi@@ bles in the value of companies .
moreover , any tax whose proce@@ eds increase in line with company returns is bound to dis@@ courage investment .
this dis@@ incentive disappears if the corporate tax base is de@@ coupled from current profits and linked to some broad measure of activity .
indeed , this would create an incentive for each company to out@@ perform the average , since abo@@ ve-@@ average profits would go un@@ tax@@ ed .
another reason to scra@@ p income and move to presum@@ p@@ tive tax@@ ation of corporate activities ste@@ ms from the eu ’ s decentralized nature .
while tax@@ ing the return on capital at the national level could dis@@ courage investment , tax@@ ing companies in exchange for location advantages might not .
countries that offer world-class infrastructure , high-@@ skill staff , and simple business rules may be well entitled to ask companies to pay a commen@@ su@@ rate tax in return .
in sum , the eu “ federal ” corporate tax should be thought of as a benefit tax , based on a broad measure of activity , applied at a moder@@ ate rate , and unrelated to current returns ; nor should it be de@@ duc@@ tible from other taxes .
among the various options under consideration , the valu@@ e-@@ added tax base – perhaps aver@@ aged over a number of years – looks best , since the accounting and ta@@ x-@@ assessment infra@@ structures already exist .
of course , valu@@ e-@@ added includes profits , and to this extent the incentive for companies to manipulate transfer prices may re@@ appear .
but the incentive would be much weak@@ ened , because gross returns typically represent a fairly small share of total valu@@ e-@@ added .
this model leaves the assessment and administration of corporate taxes entirely in the hands of member states , and would not require harmon@@ ization of legal and accounting rules .
it would be transparent , simple , and easy to ad@@ minister .
the gigantic apparatus for managing transfer prices and tax credit claims with foreign tax authorities could be dis@@ man@@ tled .
what do egypt ’ s gener@@ als want ?
cairo – “ whatever the majority in the people ’ s assembly , they are very welcome , because they won ’ t have the ability to impose anything that the people don ’ t want . ”
thus declared general mu@@ k@@ ht@@ ar al-@@ mul@@ la , a member of egypt ’ s rul@@ ing supreme council of the armed forces ( sc@@ af ) .
al-@@ mul@@ la ’ s message was that the islam@@ ists ’ victory in egypt ’ s recent election gives them neither executive power nor control of the fra@@ ming of a new constitution .
but general sam@@ i an@@ an , chief of staff and the sc@@ af ’ s de@@ pu@@ ty head , quickly counter@@ ed that al-@@ mul@@ la ’ s statement does not necessarily represent the official views of the council .
so , one year after the revolution that over@@ threw ho@@ sn@@ i mubarak , who , exactly , will set egypt ’ s political direction ?
the elec@@ toral victory of the muslim bro@@ ther@@ hood ’ s political wing and the sal@@ af@@ i parties , which together won more than 70 % of the parli@@ am@@ entary seats , will give them strong influence over the transi@@ tional period and in dra@@ fting the constitution .
but they are not alone .
aside from the islam@@ ists , two other powerful actors will have their say : the “ tahri@@ ri@@ sts ” and the gener@@ als .
tahrir square-@@ based ac@@ tivism has not only brought about social and political change , but also has served as the ultimate tool of pro-@@ democracy pressure on egypt ’ s military rul@@ ers .
indeed , while the army , the most powerful of the three actors , still officially controls the country , there is little confidence in the gener@@ als ’ commitment to democracy .
“ the sc@@ af are either anti-@@ democratic … .@@ or some of their advis@@ ers told them that democracy is not in their best interest , ” says haz@@ em ab@@ d al-@@ az@@ im , a nom@@ ine@@ e in the first post-@@ mubarak government .
if the gener@@ als do not want democracy , nor do they want direct military rule à la augu@@ st@@ o pin@@ och@@ et .
so , what do they want ?
ide@@ ally , they would like to combine the al@@ geri@@ an army ’ s current power and the turkish army ’ s legiti@@ macy .
this impli@@ es a parliament with limited powers , a weak pres@@ iden@@ cy sub@@ ordin@@ ate to the army , and constitu@@ tional pr@@ er@@ og@@ atives that legitimate the army ’ s intervention in politics .
the minimum that they insist on is reflected in statements by gener@@ als al-@@ mul@@ la , mam@@ dou@@ h sha@@ him , is@@ mail et@@ man , and others .
that would mean a ve@@ to in high politics , independence for the army ’ s budget and vast economic empire , legal imm@@ unity from pro@@ secu@@ tion on charges ste@@ mming from corruption or repres@@ sion , and constitu@@ tional pr@@ er@@ og@@ atives to guarantee these arrangements .
the new parliament and constitu@@ tional assembly will have to lead the negotiations with the sc@@ af .
but , given that any successful democratic transition must include meaningful civilian control over the armed forces and the security apparatus , the sc@@ af ’ s minimum demands could render the process meaningless .
the ve@@ to in high politics would include any issues that touch on national security or sensitive foreign policy , most importantly the relationship with israel .
with an islam@@ ist majority in the parliament promising to “ re@@ v@@ ise ” the peace agreement with israel , ten@@ sions over foreign policy are likely to rise .
the independent milit@@ ar@@ y-@@ commercial empire , which benefits from prefer@@ ential cust@@ oms and exchange rates , no tax@@ ation , land@@ -@@ con@@ fis@@ cation rights , and an army of almo@@ st-@@ free labor@@ ers ( con@@ scrip@@ ted soldiers ) , is another thor@@ ny issue .
with the egyptian economy suffering , elected politicians might seek to improve conditions by moving against the military ’ s civilian assets – namely , by re@@ vis@@ ing the prefer@@ ential rates and im@@ posing a form of tax@@ ation .
imm@@ unity from pro@@ secu@@ tion is no less sali@@ ent .
“ the fiel@@ d-@@ mar@@ sha@@ l should be in jail now , ” scre@@ amed the elected le@@ f@@ tist mp , abu e@@ zz al-@@ har@@ ir@@ i , on the second day of the new parli@@ am@@ entary session .
when mahmoud gho@@ z@@ lan , the muslim bro@@ ther@@ hood spo@@ kes@@ person , proposed imm@@ unity ( known in egypt as the “ safe@@ -@@ exit ” option ) , he faced a wave of harsh criticism .
pressure from the united states has also influenced the sc@@ af ’ s decision-making .
“ the military establishment receives $ 1.3 billion from the us … .@@ they are very sensitive to us requests , ” according to sa@@ ad e@@ ddin i@@ bra@@ him , who lob@@ bi@@ ed the obama administration to support the revolution in january 2011 .
but most of the sc@@ af ’ s pro-@@ democracy decisions have come as a result of massive pressure from tahrir square .
this includes the re@@ mov@@ al of mubarak , his trial ( and that of other regime figures ) , and bringing forward the presidential election from 2013 to june 2012 .
two other factors are equally , if not more , influential : the status quo inherited from the mubarak era and the army ’ s internal co@@ h@@ esi@@ on .
with few exceptions , the sc@@ af ’ s members benef@@ ited significantly from mubarak ’ s regime .
they will attempt to preserve as much of it as possible .
“ the sight of officers in uniform prote@@ sting in tahrir square and speaking on al jazeera really worries the field mar@@ sha@@ l , ” a former officer told me .
and one way to maintain internal co@@ h@@ esi@@ on is to create “ demon@@ s ” – a lesson learned from the “ dirty wars ” in al@@ geria in the 1990 ’ s and argentina in the 1970 ’ s and 1980 ’ s .
in particular , cop@@ tic prote@@ sters are an easy target against which to r@@ ally soldiers and officers .
last october , am@@ id an unnecessary escal@@ ation of sec@@ tarian violence , state-@@ owned television fe@@ atu@@ red a hospit@@ alized egyptian soldier screaming , “ the cop@@ ts killed my colleague ! ”
the systematic demon@@ ization of the tahri@@ r@@ ist groups , and the violent escal@@ ation that followed in november and december , served the same purpose .
despite everything , democratic egypt is not a romantic fantasy .
a year ago , sa@@ ad al-@@ ket@@ at@@ ni , the muslim bro@@ ther@@ hood leader , would never have dreamed of being speaker of parliament .
the same applies to the le@@ f@@ ti@@ sts and liberals who now hold around 20 % of the parliament ’ s seats .
if 2011 witnessed the miracle of mubarak ’ s re@@ mov@@ al , a brave parliament ’ s institutional asser@@ tiveness , coupled with non-@@ institutional tahri@@ r@@ ist pressure , could force the gener@@ als to accept a transfer of power to civilian rule ( with some reserved do@@ ma@@ ins for the army establishment ) in 2012 .
what is certain is that this year will not witness a return to the conditions of 2010 .
egypt may become stuck in democra@@ tization ’ s slow lane , but there will be no u-@@ turn .
the hundreds of thousands who mar@@ ched to tahrir square on the revolution ’ s anniversary will guarantee that .
what does america want ?
when the leaders of the world &apos;s richest nations gather in evi@@ an , france , one un@@ asked question will dominate : what does america want in the world ?
so it may be helpful to out@@ line the principles and ideas that guide us foreign policy .
first , in@@ consisten@@ cy is no vice .
indeed , in foreign policy@@ making , in@@ consisten@@ cy is often a virtue .
i speak not of principles , but of policy .
what happened in iraq should not be over ‑ interpreted as a rigid template for us policy toward countries that pursue weapons of mass destruction , support terrorism , or deny people liberty .
in iraq , the us used force as a last resort , against a country with a clear record of aggression , and after a large degree of international consensus had developed about what iraq needed to do .
different poli@@ ci@@ es-@@ tail@@ ored for local , regional , and international reali@@ ti@@ es-@@ will be needed to meet the challenges posed by north korea , iran , syria , or elsewhere .
america &apos;s armed forces are an essential background to much of what the us accompli@@ shes internation@@ ally .
but defense policy is only one component of foreign policy .
not every threat to america &apos;s national interests can be addressed with military power .
if all you have to work with is a hammer , as the saying goes , every problem looks like a nail .
success in foreign policy , as in car@@ pent@@ ry , requires the right tools for the job .
partnership is essential here .
for all of america &apos;s power , there is little that the us can do in the world that it can &apos;t do better with the active participation of others , be they governments , international organizations , or non-@@ governmental organizations .
partnership facili@@ tates solutions to problems that de@@ fy purely national responses and means that bur@@ dens are shared .
america reli@@ es on partnerships in the global war on terrorism : foreign governments provide intelligence and law en@@ for@@ cement cooperation ; trading partners ensure the security of shipping containers ; private financial institutions help track the transfers of funds that sustain terror networks .
beyond partnerships , international institutions add valu@@ e-@@ provided they are effectively organized , have realistic mand@@ ates , and contain members that are committed to common norms and aims .
such institutions can and often do advance us national interests .
indeed , it would be difficult to carry out critical dimensions of us foreign policy@@ -@@ from trade to non ‑ proliferation to environmental policy@@ -@@ without them .
the world trade organization is a case in point .
it provides a forum in which to negotiate new trade liber@@ alization agre@@ ements , seek reme@@ dies against prote@@ c@@ tionist and discrimin@@ atory policies , and resolve dispu@@ tes with trading partners .
but the us must also ensure that existing institutions are adapted to current realities .
nato , for example , is evolving from a cold war alliance focused sol@@ ely on europe to one su@@ ited to meeting today &apos;s security challenges wherever they may arise , such as in afghanistan and possibly iraq .
multi@@ lat@@ er@@ alism is most successful when built on a real convergence of interests and values .
the un and other global frame@@ works may sometimes be best placed to address us foreign policy goals .
when the un or other bodies are un@@ willing or unable to move against di@@ re threats , america reserves the right to act in less en@@ com@@ passing alli@@ ances or flexible , ad ho@@ c co@@ ali@@ tions of the willing .
not even the un has a monopoly on legiti@@ macy , which depends most on an action &apos;s rationale and the manner in which it is under@@ taken .
this flexibility is needed because of the nature of the challenges that lo@@ om on the horizon .
we ignore failing states at our per@@ il , because an@@ archy creates an environment condu@@ ci@@ ve to extrem@@ ist ide@@ ologies and can offer a haven for terrorists , criminals , and drug traffi@@ ckers .
one of our most pressing tasks today is to prevent the im@@ plo@@ sion of weak states .
another is to ass@@ ist countries that have collapsed into violence to begin the slow process of recovery .
one impulse behind america &apos;s international engagement , and one of the great sources of its global power , has been its enduring impulse to make the world a better place .
any us foreign policy must combine interests and values , because the american public always insi@@ sts that us national obje@@ ctives be linked to national ideals .
the appeal of us leadership abroad re@@ sts in part on the attra@@ c@@ tiveness of america &apos;s political institutions , society , and culture , and its willingness to champion human rights and democracy .
at the same time , our efforts to promote democracy worldwide serve us interests , o@@ wing to the hard@@ headed realization that democracies settle their differences peace@@ ably .
today &apos;s world lac@@ ks irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conflict among the main concent@@ rations of world power : europe , russia , china , japan , and the us .
this con@@ gru@@ ence of interest and agreement on the rules of international order offers a promising foundation for managing the common challenges that confront us all .
our over ‑ riding goal should be to create a world in which governments , organizations , and peoples embrace arrangements that allow them to realize their shared interests and that reflect fundamental universal values .
everyone has an interest in a world in which force is used only as a last resort , terrorism is regarded as beyond the p@@ ale , weapons of mass destruction do not spread and are not used , free trade becomes the norm , citizens enjoy basic liber@@ ties , democratic values triumph , and the rule of law re@@ places the way of the gun .
bringing such an integrated world may be optimistic , even ide@@ alistic , but it is hardly naive .
what does japan want from america ?
o@@ sa@@ ka – three months after the democratic party of japan ’ s land@@ slide gener@@ al-@@ election victory , the new administration ’ s foreign and security policy appears to be increasingly at odds with that of the united states .
indeed , there is growing concern on both sides of the pacific that prime minister yu@@ kio hat@@ oy@@ ama inten@@ ds to turn away from the declining us he@@ gem@@ on and reach out to a rising china .
indeed , hat@@ oy@@ ama has announced his ru@@ di@@ mentary vision of building an east asian community that exclu@@ des the us .
hat@@ oy@@ ama has ha@@ sti@@ ly attempted to fulfill the d@@ p@@ j ’ s party manifest@@ o and his own public ple@@ dges .
this includes termin@@ ating re@@ plen@@ ishment support for the us-@@ led inter@@ di@@ ction operation in the indian ocean , reducing ho@@ st-@@ nation support to us forces based in japan , and re@@ vis@@ ing the bil@@ ateral stat@@ us-@@ of-@@ force agreement .
moreover , hat@@ oy@@ ama is set to expose a secret cold war nuclear agreement that opened japanese ports to us na@@ val vessels carrying nuclear weapons , in contra@@ vention of japan ’ s three non-@@ nuclear principles , which have guided official policy since the late 1960 ’ s .
last but not least , hat@@ oy@@ ama is post@@ po@@ ning imple@@ mentation of a bil@@ ateral agreement with the us to reloc@@ ate a marine corps base on the island of okin@@ a@@ wa , from fu@@ ten@@ ma to hen@@ o@@ ko , thereby causing con@@ fusion for america ’ s plan to reloc@@ ate part of its forces on okin@@ a@@ wa to gu@@ am .
the significance of these moves has , however , been poorly understood .
hat@@ oy@@ ama ’ s asser@@ tiveness vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis the us is in accor@@ d with japan ’ s position as the world ’ s largest credi@@ tor with the least damaged banking sector .
but a decisi@@ ve foreig@@ n-@@ policy shift has not occurred – nor will one occur in the near future .
instead , hat@@ oy@@ ama has simply stressed japan ’ s need to be on an equal foot@@ ing in alliance management with the us .
likewise , his proposed regional community would be open in nature , and would welcome strong us involvement , although without formal us mem@@ ber@@ ship , on geographic grounds .
thus , the current us-@@ japanese e@@ str@@ ange@@ ment is being driven by a spiral of mi@@ str@@ ust that does not stem from geo-@@ strategic concerns .
rather , japan has initi@@ ated a series of ab@@ rupt policy changes , while the us , only di@@ m@@ ly aware of the significance of its relative decline , assumes that japan ’ s dec@@ ad@@ es-@@ long do@@ ci@@ lity will continue .
flaws in the transition between japanese governments are also to blame .
hat@@ oy@@ ama ’ s ministers did not ask their counter@@ parts in the de@@ par@@ ting administration of former prime minister tar@@ o as@@ o to inform them fully about existing and potential foreig@@ n-@@ policy problems . nor did the as@@ o government ’ s members , stu@@ pe@@ fied by their crus@@ hing elec@@ toral defeat , offer to do so .
the reloc@@ ation of the marine corps base – an issue bur@@ den@@ ed by the competing imper@@ atives of hat@@ oy@@ ama ’ s coalition government , american military strategy , and local anti-@@ base politics on the island of okin@@ a@@ wa – is now a focal point of ten@@ sions with the us .
the base agreement – reached after ten years of bil@@ ateral negotiations – is the most practical option for avoiding potentially disa@@ strous aerial accidents in a heavily populated area , and for reducing crimes committed by us soldiers against local japanese , including , most not@@ ori@@ ously , several ra@@ pes .
the base agreement is essential for maintaining the political and strategic vi@@ ability of the bil@@ ateral alliance .
yet , during the d@@ p@@ j ’ s election campaign , hat@@ oy@@ ama vo@@ wed to eliminate the marines ’ presence on okin@@ a@@ wa .
to make matters worse , the social democratic party ( s@@ dp ) has threatened to leave the government coalition if hat@@ oy@@ ama breaks his promise – a move that would deny the d@@ p@@ j a simple majority in the diet ’ s upper house .
nor does it hold the two-thirds majority in the lower house needed to over@@ ride upper-@@ house resol@@ u@@ tions .
thus , hat@@ oy@@ ama is forced to sub@@ ordin@@ ate japan ’ s alliance with the us to his government ’ s survival , at least until next summer ’ s upper-@@ house elections .
by then , the government will have en@@ acted more of its leg@@ isla@@ tive program , potentially enabling the d@@ p@@ j to gain seats .
hat@@ oy@@ ama cannot please everyone all the time , least of all the us .
while he has repeatedly emphasi@@ zed japan ’ s equal foot@@ ing with the us in alliance management , this does not extend to japan ’ s military capability and defense burden .
obviously , he inten@@ ds to keep asym@@ metri@@ cal recipro@@ city embedded in the bil@@ ateral mutual security treaty : the us def@@ ends japan , and japan le@@ ases to the us many large bases that are essential to its global military posture .
moreover , he evi@@ dently believes that the geo-@@ strategic value of the bases enable him to bar@@ gain for a major us compromise .
if this approach does not work , and if the existing marine base on okin@@ a@@ wa remains , hat@@ oy@@ ama can pass the bu@@ ck to the us , thereby defle@@ cting anti-@@ base pressure from local residents .
he would also retain the current marine corps presence as a tri@@ p@@ wire for us military intervention in the case of a fl@@ are-@@ up across the taiwan stra@@ it , whereas gu@@ am is beyond the effective range of chinese bal@@ li@@ stic missi@@ les .
hat@@ oy@@ ama is certainly a clever political tac@@ ti@@ cian , but that is not sufficient to make him a wise leader .
above all , he must not play with fire : the us-@@ japan alliance is a public good that is in@@ dispen@@ s@@ able for the peace and security of the asi@@ a-@@ pacific region .
what do muslim women want ?
new york – when car@@ ic@@ ature takes the place of dialogue , everyone suffers – especially when it comes to understanding issues affecting women , who struggle worldwide against being sil@@ enced .
some right-@@ wing american bloggers recently twisted an article that i wrote in a way that did just that .
i wrote that many women activists in muslim countries tend to emphasize issues such as honor kill@@ ings , legal inequality , and lack of access to education , and that they express frustration that the obsession among westerners with muslim women ’ s clothing can come at the expense of these concerns .
i also pointed out that many muslim femini@@ sts defend their dress in terms of nation@@ alism , anti-@@ imperi@@ alism , or as a matter of faith .
this provo@@ ked a small fire@@ storm of distor@@ tion in the west : “ wolf wants to institution@@ alize the bur@@ ka , ” etc . it was depressing to see a simple appeal for westerners to listen to muslim women deliberately distorted into a representation of all muslim women as me@@ ek , will@@ -@@ less beings in need of rescue .
the women leaders i met in am@@ man were not saying , “ please tell the west to save us . ” they were too busy making egal@@ itarian , modern@@ ist new worlds of their own , with an arab , and often islamic , im@@ pri@@ ma@@ tur .
princess ry@@ m ali , si@@ ster@@ -in-law of queen r@@ ania – the chan@@ el-@@ wearing media star who is re@@ brand@@ ing a more contemporary jordan – is one vivid example ; princess ry@@ m is making immense progress in a more be@@ hin@@ d-@@ the-@@ scenes way .
she met me in a le@@ af@@ y am@@ man subur@@ b , in the palace that she shares with prince ali and their small children .
a former cnn journalist , her quiet bearing and diplo@@ matic manner bel@@ ie her courage : she captured her husband ’ s heart as she was reporting from bag@@ h@@ dad on the eve of “ shock and awe , ” standing firm before the cameras even as the bombs were falling .
princess ry@@ m and prince ali have supported a new film institute , the red sea institute of c@@ ine@@ matic arts , a joint production with the university of southern california that is bringing together bright young people from all over the middle east to learn contemporary film@@ making , app@@ rentice with international film produ@@ ctions , and get the region ’ s stories out .
though she can no longer practice journalism directly , princess ry@@ m is also co-@@ founding new jordan@@ ian journalism school .
her aim is to replace journalists ’ acceptance of the “ party line ” – even if the party is her own extended family – with a more critical perspective .
she directed my attention to jordan@@ i@@ an-@@ made films about the sub@@ ordin@@ ation of women inside the home , and to ran@@ a hus@@ sein@@ i ’ s powerful book on honor kill@@ ings , murder in the name of honor .
but her implic@@ it message was that these critical exam@@ in@@ ations of women ’ s inequality in the arab world are most enlighten@@ ing when they are created by women ’ s advoc@@ ates from within that culture , rather than sen@@ sa@@ tion@@ alized or super@@ ficial versions of the problem created in the west .
mary na@@ zz@@ al , owner , with her family , of a ch@@ ic and bu@@ st@@ ling bou@@ ti@@ que hotel , is another dynam@@ o who looks as if she stepped out of a fashion shoot .
but it would be a mistake to underestimate her seriousness .
i call her “ martha stewart meets che gu@@ ev@@ ara , ” because , when not reno@@ v@@ ating the elegant public spaces of her hotel , she is su@@ ing israeli gener@@ als for war crimes that she claims were committed against civili@@ ans in gaza .
na@@ zz@@ al was trained as a british barri@@ ster , and chairs the board of the human rights legal aid fund .
her organization is intent on using international law to hold accountable members of the israeli military who put civili@@ ans in harm ’ s way during the invasion of gaza – events that the recent gold@@ stone report con@@ firms .
she is passionate about the palestinian cause , mixing her cutting-edge legal advoc@@ acy with a willingness to listen to decent people from all sides of the conflict , and a fier@@ ce attachment to peace in the region based on due process and justice .
finally there is ran@@ a hus@@ sein@@ i herself – a role model for investig@@ ative reporters everywhere who began documenting and investigating honor kill@@ ings in her newspaper , the jordan times .
honor kill@@ ings claim an estimated 5,000 women every year , and are increasingly common in immigrant communities abroad .
according to her account , a woman can be killed for “ laughing at a joke in the street , wearing makeup or a short skir@@ t … or being raped by a brother . ”
after she began her series of reports , hus@@ sein@@ i received death threats at her office almost daily – as well as hundreds of letters of support from readers .
as a result of her brave investig@@ ations , which included interviews in prisons , many muslim countries are re@@ vis@@ ing their criminal codes , and the issue has taken center stage internation@@ ally .
these women are exactly the kind of leaders that everyone should be cultiv@@ ating and supporting , rather than over@@ looking because of a belief that they cannot exist in the middle east .
we would do better to find out more about them than to waste our time on super@@ ficial deb@@ ates about how they – and many others who are just as accomplished – should dress .
what euro crisis ?
mun@@ ich – despite huge rescue pack@@ ages , interest@@ -@@ rate spreads in europe refuse to bu@@ dge .
markets have not yet found their equilibrium , and the governments on europe ’ s south@@ western ri@@ m are nerv@@ ously watching how events unfold .
what is going on ?
the rescue pack@@ ages were put together on the weekend of may 8-@@ 9 in brus@@ sels .
in addition to the € 80 billion program already agreed for greece , the european union countries agreed on a € 500 billion credit line for other dist@@ ressed countries .
the international mon@@ etary fund added a further € 2@@ 80 billion .
the driving force behind all this was french president ni@@ col@@ as sar@@ ko@@ zy , who coll@@ u@@ ded with the heads of europe ’ s southern countries .
french banks , which were over@@ ly exposed to southern european government bonds , were key bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ aries of the rescue pack@@ ages .
since rescue measures beyond the pre-@@ arranged greek package had not been on the agenda for the brus@@ sels meeting , german chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a mer@@ kel thought she could safely go to moscow to com@@ memor@@ ate the end of world war ii – unlike sar@@ ko@@ zy , who declined russian prime minister v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin ’ s invitation .
worse , the leader of the german dele@@ gation to the eu meeting fell ill and was taken to hospital upon arri@@ val in brus@@ sels . this left the german dele@@ gation head@@ less .
pro@@ cla@@ iming a systemic crisis of the euro , sar@@ ko@@ zy sei@@ zed the opportunity and took germany by surprise .
he asked for huge sums of money and , as spanish prime minister jo@@ s@@ é lu@@ is zap@@ ater@@ o reported , threatened to pull france out of the euro and break up the fran@@ co-@@ german axis unless germany opened its purse .
after just two days of negotiations , the ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht treaty ’ s no-@@ bail@@ out cl@@ ause , which germany once had made a condition for giving up the deutsche mark , was de@@ fun@@ ct .
even the european central bank chi@@ pped in , buying government bonds of over-@@ inde@@ b@@ ted countries , using a lo@@ op@@ hole in the ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht treaty and over@@ rul@@ ing the bank ’ s german representatives .
the european house cre@@ aked mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ ly .
germany ’ s president stepped down soon after the decisions – some say because of them .
germany ’ s political elite are in an u@@ pro@@ ar , and serious voices advocate spli@@ tting the euro@@ zone into northern and southern tiers , with france rele@@ gated to the lat@@ ter .
i do not share this view .
the euro has successfully protected europe against ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate risks , and it is a useful step towards further european integration .
moreover , the stability provided by the fran@@ co-@@ german axis is in@@ dispen@@ s@@ able for europe .
nevertheless , the ten@@ sions created by sar@@ ko@@ zy ’ s reck@@ lessness threaten europe ’ s political stability , hei@@ ghten@@ ing market uncertainty relative to what a more p@@ ru@@ dent , coordinated rescue program would have impli@@ ed .
the programs that have been agreed will not suff@@ ice to reas@@ sure credi@@ tors , and germany will most likely be un@@ willing to bow once again to sar@@ ko@@ zy in the coming negotiations to pro@@ long the rescue measures – at least as they are constructed now – beyond the initially sti@@ pul@@ ated three years .
the arguments used to justify the coup are du@@ bi@@ ous .
in order to overcome the no-@@ bail@@ out cl@@ ause , sar@@ ko@@ zy and other european leaders dramati@@ zed the decline of southern european governments ’ bonds and the corresponding increase in interest@@ -@@ rate spreads .
by form@@ ally pro@@ cla@@ iming a systemic euro crisis – when in fact there was only nervous market reaction concern@@ ing a few european countries ’ government bonds – they could inv@@ o@@ ke article 12@@ 2 of the union treaty , which was intended to help member countries in the event of natural disasters beyond their control .
if anything , the pro@@ cla@@ mation of a systemic crisis poured fuel on the fire .
investors took europe ’ s leaders at their word , because politicians usually down@@ play rather than over@@ state a crisis .
the average interest@@ -@@ rate spread relative to germany of the countries protected by the new rescue package was 1.@@ 0@@ 8 percentage points on may 7 , when the world was cla@@ imed to be going under .
then it seemed that the rescue pack@@ ages were pushing the spreads to much lower values , but optimism fa@@ ded as european leaders ’ interpretation of the crisis sun@@ k in with more and more market participants .
in the week ending june 18 , the average spread had climbed to 1.@@ 1 points .
obviously , the market is now as nervous as it was before that may weekend .
in 1995 , shortly before the euro was announced , the corresponding interest@@ -@@ rate spread was 2.@@ 6 percentage points , more than twice today ’ s level .
the euro was simply in no danger when european leaders decided to rescue it , and it is not in danger now .
markets are just moving towards a new equilibrium with higher interest@@ -@@ rate spreads , which reflect the higher default risk of some european countries – a bit like in pre-@@ euro times , though much less extreme .
there is nothing wrong with this . the market adju@@ st@@ ment will end when appropriate spreads are found .
any political attempt to stop this process any sooner is bound to fail .
there is no reason for panic , and every reason to stay calm and wait for the new equilibrium to emerge .
interest@@ -@@ rate spreads between safe and risky assets are natural to functioning credit markets .
they signal potential risks and en@@ force debt discipline on bor@@ ro@@ wers .
this is exactly what europe needs .
the stability and growth p@@ act , aimed at pun@@ ishing countries that bre@@ ach the 3 % -@@ of-@@ gdp deficit limit , was a joke : not a single way@@ ward country was ever pun@@ ished .
fortunately , capital markets finally stepped in to impose the necessary hard budget constraints on governments .
this discipline will stem the gigantic capital impor@@ ts by the countries at europe ’ s peripher@@ y and end the over@@ heating us@@ her@@ ed in by the interest@@ -@@ rate convergence that the euro brought about .
these countries will go through a sl@@ um@@ p that will reduce their inflation ( perhaps bringing them close to def@@ lation ) improve their competi@@ tiveness , and reduce their curr@@ ent-@@ account defic@@ its .
french finance minister christ@@ ine la@@ gar@@ de , who often complained about trade im@@ balances in europe , should applau@@ d these market reactions , which were un@@ inten@@ tionally streng@@ th@@ ened by her president .
what euro crisis ?
frank@@ fur@@ t – what constit@@ utes a crisis ?
is it sustained economic decline , high and long-term unemployment , poverty , ramp@@ ant inflation , a precipit@@ ous fall in the exchange rate , fiscal defic@@ its , high borrowing costs , and political dys@@ function ?
most would agree that a crisis exists if just some of these “ misery indi@@ ces ” are present .
but , while europe is widely perceived to be in the grip of crisis , only a handful of them are present , and in only a few euro@@ zone countries .
so , why is there a euro@@ zone crisis , and what defines it ?
time and again , it is argued that the single currency does not fit the different needs of its member countries , and that unsustainable economic divergence will ultimately require that the euro be abandoned .
the fatal diver@@ gen@@ ces that are most frequently c@@ ited include differences in growth rates , job@@ -@@ creation , and unemployment rates , as well as dramatic dispar@@ ities in curr@@ ent-@@ account balances , all of which may be tra@@ ce@@ able to wide devi@@ ations in unit labor costs .
perceptions of such diver@@ gen@@ ces force consider@@ able risk premi@@ ums on problem countries , inevitably resul@@ ting in accelerating capital flight to safe ha@@ vens .
all of these developments are now visible in the euro@@ zone , particularly in its peripher@@ al countries .
risk premi@@ ums started rising above benign levels in 2009 , and then more strongly in 20@@ 1@@ 1-@@ 2012 , while capital flight became ramp@@ ant in 2011 .
but , if one consi@@ ders what might under@@ lie capital movements of this sort , suspi@@ cion must also fall on unsustainable policies that extend to countries well outside the euro@@ zone .
in the wider european union , countries like the united kingdom or hung@@ ary are as much aff@@ li@@ cted by structural defi@@ ci@@ encies as some peripher@@ al euro@@ zone countries are .
ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate flexibility has not helped them much , or at least they have chosen not to exploit it .
moreover , there are countries with govern@@ ment-@@ debt bur@@ dens that are as large , if not larger , than those on europe ’ s peripher@@ y – the united states and japan being prime examples .
other countries , like norway and switzerland , are running curr@@ ent-@@ account sur@@ pl@@ uses that exce@@ ed 10 % of their gdp , but are resi@@ sting currency re@@ valu@@ ation .
it is worth remembering that , for the decade until 2005 , germany was labeled the “ sick man of europe . ”
germany was un@@ competitive when it entered the euro@@ zone , o@@ wing to exc@@ essive wage and price increases following the country ’ s re@@ uni@@ fication – a problem that has since been overcome by structural reforms that the country under@@ took within the single currency .
the same is true for the most recent euro@@ zone member , est@@ onia , whose rigorous wage restra@@ int en@@ su@@ red competi@@ tiveness in the single market in a short period of time .
why , then , is there such strong doubt that the euro can survive ?
some say that the current efforts to en@@ force sound policies in the peripher@@ al countries are bound to fail , and that sacrifi@@ cing democracy in these countries to keep the mon@@ etary union intact is too high a price to pay .
in fact , the efforts of governments and international institutions point the way toward more sustainable solutions .
who would have believed at this time last year that the fiscal p@@ act adopted in march would have been possible ?
and , despite fluctuations , has there not been a consider@@ able reduction in risk premi@@ ums for problem countries , without adding to the finan@@ cing costs of donor countries ?
are we seeing tent@@ ative signs of escape from the euro@@ zone ’ s mal@@ a@@ ise ?
will deb@@ tor countries be able to stick to tough reform programs , or will their citizens reject au@@ ster@@ ity ?
and will donor countries avoid the sort of popu@@ list bac@@ klas@@ h at home that might push them in a prote@@ c@@ tionist direction ?
intelligent cooperation that avo@@ ids moral hazard should be able to prevent panic , reduce risk premi@@ ums , and per@@ mit fuller use of resources .
for example , transnational migration flows should certainly be made easier and more attractive .
high levels of unemployment , particularly among young skilled workers , could be avoi@@ ded if donor countries that need migr@@ ants to invi@@ gor@@ ate their own work@@ forces were able to attract them .
more immigration would streng@@ then skills and raise income levels , while reducing dist@@ ressed countries ’ expen@@ di@@ ture on unemployment benefits .
greater labor mobility within the eu would also help to create a more open european mindset , and thus wea@@ ken old nation@@ alist preju@@ di@@ ces .
so , will europe commit to moving toward political union , and thereby address what has remained missing , despite the single market , the euro , and the schen@@ gen agreement ’ s elimin@@ ation of internal borders ?
the model for a future united states of europe is switzerland , a country with four languages and ethni@@ cities , fis@@ cally strong sub-@@ national units ( c@@ ant@@ ons ) , a single first-@@ rate currency , and a federal government and a parliament that exercis@@ es genuine , if limited , fiscal authority .
if the eu made the most of the compe@@ ten@@ cies that it already has , and governed more effectively , the union as a whole could achieve faster economic growth for at least the next decade , with a 2.5 % annual rate not out of reach .
more generous support for countries in trouble is essential , because the euro must be preserved ( alb@@ eit not necessarily on the base of a larger euro@@ zone ) .
financial markets would be more easily convinced if such support were comple@@ mented by the recipi@@ ent countries ’ acceptance of the fiscal p@@ act , together with technical help to streng@@ then their governance .
in greece , anti-@@ corruption officers from the us , italian ta@@ x-@@ efficiency specialists , german priva@@ tization experts , and spanish tourism professionals should be made available to accelerate the pace of moderni@@ zation .
all of this amounts to a mu@@ ch-@@ needed and of@@ ten-@@ advoc@@ ated marshall plan for the peripher@@ y .
but it recognizes that what europe ’ s troubled countries need most is not money , but the planning and administra@@ tive capacity to spend it effectively .
over the last decade , greece could absorb only a fifth of the eu moderni@@ zation funds available to it .
it didn ’ t have to be that way then , and europe cannot afford to let it remain that way now .
what the eu must do now
washington , dc – the united kingdom ’ s bre@@ x@@ it vote is arguably the greatest disaster ever to hit the european union .
now , the eu must act fast – not least by ending the post-@@ refer@@ end@@ um market tur@@ mo@@ il – if it is to survive .
british prime minister david cameron , having lost the refer@@ end@@ um , did the obvious thing by res@@ ig@@ ning .
but the other loser is the european commission , whose president , jean-@@ c@@ lau@@ de jun@@ cker , did little to change the outcome of the bre@@ x@@ it vote .
not since jacques del@@ ors was president of the commission , from 1985 to 1995 , has that position been filled by a leader with any vision or political cl@@ out .
jun@@ cker , like cameron , should accept responsibility and res@@ ign .
the eu needs a strong leader again .
there are many worthy candidates , but i recommend former swedish prime minister carl bild@@ t .
before the post-@@ refer@@ end@@ um dust sett@@ les , the eu should set an ulti@@ mat@@ um with clear and on@@ er@@ ous principles for the uk ’ s exit – clarity to minimize the cost , and sever@@ ity to deter popu@@ lists in other member states from calling for exit refer@@ en@@ da , too .
sensi@@ bly , european commission leaders have already moved in this direction by vo@@ i@@ ding conc@@ essions made by the eu to the uk back in february and declar@@ ing that there “ will be no rene@@ goti@@ ation . ”
the european council , for its part , has already called for an immediate summit .
having failed for six years to resolve the greek financial crisis , the eu finally appears to understand that its very survival depends on swi@@ ft and decisi@@ ve action .
but the eu must go further than just bre@@ x@@ it damage control .
for the last four decades , europe ’ s fundamental problem has been com@@ plac@@ ency in the face of low economic growth caused by exc@@ essive tax@@ ation and regulation .
europe can no longer afford this stand@@ still .
it must now begin to carry out fundamental reforms : cut un@@ justi@@ fied social benefits ; liber@@ alize services , labor markets , and digital markets ; reduce labor taxes ; deregu@@ late industry ; improve education ; and promote research and development .
current eu rules are clear on the responsibilities of eu institutions and national governments , respe@@ ctively .
the problem is that most european governments ( especially british tory governments ) tend to sc@@ ape@@ goat the eu to mask their own political myo@@ pi@@ a .
little wonder that the eu has grown so un@@ popular .
given that it already receives the blame , the european commission should now be granted the power to act politically .
the eu has a strong case to make for itself , but it needs good-@@ faith leaders to deliver its message to the people .
european popu@@ lists point to the mis@@ handling of migration issues to justify their cause .
so , for star@@ ters , the eu should establish an or@@ derly migration policy with quot@@ as and criteria , as australia and canada have successfully done , and impose proper control over its external borders .
the eu border control agency , fron@@ tex , needs a stronger mandate and more resources to fulfill this crucial role .
going further , the eu should institute a joint foreign and defense policy to address the underlying causes of the migration crisis – namely , the conflicts in libya and syria .
for a quar@@ ter-@@ century , europe has benef@@ ited from the post-@@ cold war peace divi@@ dend and ir@@ responsi@@ bly allowed member states ’ average defense expen@@ di@@ ture to slip to a pal@@ try 1.@@ 4 % of gdp .
this should be increased to at least the 2 % of gdp each nato member has promised .
today , only five eu countries have defense expen@@ di@@ tures at that level .
with good reason , us president barack obama has called europeans “ free ri@@ ders . ”
republican presidential candidate don@@ ald trum@@ p , going much further , open@@ ly questions both nato and us military expen@@ di@@ tures abroad .
in the near future , europe may no longer be able to rely on the us to defend it and should prepare for a scenario in which it is forced to f@@ end for itself .
the principle of representative democracy is at the heart of european identity ; ironically , only eu non-@@ member switzerland has a strong tradition of refer@@ en@@ da .
one of the positive consequences of the squ@@ al@@ id bre@@ x@@ it campaign is that it demonstrated that refer@@ en@@ da and ple@@ bis@@ c@@ ites are de@@ ma@@ go@@ gic , not truly democratic .
eu members should recognize the risks of so-called direct democracy and ti@@ gh@@ ten the criteria for the passage of refer@@ en@@ da .
the best one can say about bre@@ x@@ it is that it finally may have put an end to european com@@ plac@@ ency .
we will know for sure only if , and when , europe choo@@ ses to save itself .
whatever happened to wage insurance ?
a lot of public attention and worry nowadays surrounds the new risks that globalization and information technology create for our wages and live@@ li@@ hoods .
but there has been far less construc@@ tive discussion of new ideas about how to confront these risks .
in fact , we might be losing the momentum we had a few years ago to implement some of these ideas .
to be sure , we still sym@@ path@@ ize with people who , upon reaching middle age or later , find themselves replaced by lower@@ -@@ paid workers in another part of the world , if not by a computer or a robot .
but are we really going to do anything about these risks ?
one new idea that seemed hot a few years ago is “ wage insurance . ”
as then flo@@ ated , the idea was simple : the government would protect people from the risk of losing their job and being unable to find a new one at the same wage .
a government insurance program would pay these people a fraction , say , half , the difference between their old pay and their pay in a new job for a speci@@ fied period , such as two years .
the idea was first proposed by robert z. lawrence and robert li@@ tan in their 1986 book , saving free trade , andre@@ vi@@ ved in a 2001 article by li@@ tan and lor@@ i k@@ letz@@ er .
the proposal generated interest .
a demonstration program was adopted in the united states in 2002 . in 2002 , the har@@ tz commission recommen@@ ded a version of it in germany .
wage insurance programs have been actively talked about or actually implemented in some form in britain , france , switzerland , and ireland .
despite all the intellectual applause , however , wage insurance programs are still not a significant force in the world economy .
they should be .
but they should also be supp@@ le@@ mented by other devices .
one advantage of wage insurance is that it may be a more effective way to subsidi@@ ze on-@@ the-@@ job training than traditional govern@@ ment-@@ run vo@@ cational training programs .
often , after comple@@ ting a govern@@ ment-@@ sponsored program , participants find it impossible to secure a job with the promised higher pay .
far better , pro@@ pon@@ ents of wage insurance argue , for the training to be carried out by an emplo@@ yer who wants a job done and knows what the employee needs to learn .
it seems plau@@ sible that two years is long enough for re@@ training , after which the employee might command a higher wage without a government subsi@@ dy .
but governments , fe@@ aring the expense of wage insurance if a lot of people exploit it , have not been willing to implement it on a large scale .
for example , the us wage insurance program is confined to manufacturing workers over age 50 who are in competi@@ tively vulnerable industries and are de@@ em@@ ed by the secretary of labor to have non@@ transfer@@ able skills .
moreover , the benefit is ca@@ pped at $ 5,000 per year .
the program has practically been forgotten , and will ex@@ pi@@ re next year unless it is rene@@ wed .
with government defic@@ its the norm , that appears unlikely .
the way to regain lost momentum is to recognize that wage insurance is only one of several new ideas for insur@@ ing the emerging risks of this century .
the weakness of the current wage insurance proposal is that it pays benefits only for a limited period and reli@@ es for its long-term effect on the re@@ training incentives that it creates .
in reality , however , losing a high-@@ paying job may be a lifetime event , and the supposed re@@ training that wage insurance would encourage for a lai@@ d-@@ off 50-@@ year-old worker often may be in@@ effective .
in my 2003 book , new financial order : risk in the 21st century , i proposed a different idea , which i called “ live@@ lihood insurance . ”
as the name impli@@ es , live@@ lihood insurance is designed to provide more than just a brief res@@ pite or a subsi@@ dy for re@@ training .
it is aimed at dealing with long-term changes in the labor market , rather than as@@ suring temporary wage levels .
it would also rely on the market rather than a government program .
with live@@ lihood insurance , a private insur@@ er would pay a stream of income to a policy@@ holder if an index of average income in the insu@@ red person ’ s occupation and region dec@@ lines substan@@ tially .
moreover , this income stream would continue for as long as the index stays down , not just for a couple of years ( or any other arbitrary period ) .
in other words , this insurance policy would protect against lifetime income risks .
one reason why govern@@ ment-@@ run wage insurance programs must have limited duration is that they involve so-called “ moral hazard ” : the risk that people will get lazy or would take easier , lower@@ -@@ paying jobs and continue to collect insurance that pays them the wage of a more demanding occupation .
but this would not apply to live@@ lihood insurance , because its benefits are tied to the rise and fall of income indi@@ ces , which are beyond the control of individuals .
live@@ lihood insurance would also have another advantage .
since the premi@@ um would be determined by the market , it would be higher in occupa@@ tions that the market believes to be in danger from outsour@@ cing or technical change .
this , in turn , would give workers a tangible warning and an incentive to anticipate job losses before they occur .
this is not to say that wage insurance is a bad idea , or that it should not be implemented on a wider scale .
both wage and live@@ lihood insurance appear to have important risk management functions .
indeed , for the future , it is imperative to think about many new ways , involving both government and the market , to ensure that we manage better the greatest personal risks now faced by workers around the world .
berlin – berlin ’ s te@@ gel airport , which still gre@@ ets most of the passengers arriving in the capital of europe ’ s leading economic power , is out@@ dated and provin@@ cial .
the opening of schö@@ ne@@ feld airport , transformed into an international hub , has been del@@ a@@ yed for more than a year for technical reasons ( a somewhat reas@@ suring challenge to germany ’ s reputation for efficiency ) .
yet , despite the gray and chill of march in central europe , berlin exu@@ des confidence .
more than ever , the city is a work in progress – confused , not very beautiful , and over@@ charged with history .
young ber@@ lin@@ ers cannot ignore where they come from .
yet , perhaps because the past still rings like a warning – and is still physically visible in the topo@@ graphy and architecture of the city today – berlin is striking in its simplicity , its radi@@ ant moder@@ nity ( symboli@@ zed by the glass dome of the reich@@ stag , a conception of the british architect norman foster ) , and , above all , its intensity .
that positive energy contra@@ sts star@@ k@@ ly with the dec@@ ad@@ ent beauty of paris , a city that is on a path of “ mus@@ ei@@ fication . ”
of course , if you can afford to live there , paris remains a great place to be .
but berlin is a better place to work , even if what you do is very poorly paid .
the por@@ ter who brings my lu@@ g@@ gage to my hotel room is of tunisi@@ an origin .
he is a happy ber@@ lin@@ er and a proud new german .
and , even on a low salary , he can live and raise his children in the city itself .
thanks to its moder@@ ate housing costs , berlin has not become , like paris , a ghet@@ to for the rich .
unlike the french , who are handi@@ ca@@ pped by the high cost of housing , ger@@ mans ’ purchasing power is more harmon@@ i@@ ously distributed , creating more room for household consumption to contribute to economic growth .
germany ’ s positive energy is , of course , the result of success translated into confidence , which chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a mer@@ kel incar@@ nat@@ es with strength and simplicity .
mer@@ kel has changed profoundly while in office .
five years ago , she did not exu@@ de the natural authority that she now poss@@ esses .
today , like pope francis , she is clearly at ease with herself .
has there been a french president since fran@@ ç@@ ois mit@@ terr@@ and who was truly a match for a german chan@@ cell@@ or ?
if france has replaced germany as “ the sick man of europe , ” it is for political reasons , above all : vision , courage , and strength on the northern side of the r@@ hine , and vac@@ il@@ lation , iner@@ tia , and weakness on the southern .
of course , given its exc@@ essi@@ vely low sal@@ aries and ad@@ verse demographic trends , germany will continue to face difficulties .
but to emphasize only these problems , as some french do , is pure escap@@ ism .
german demo@@ graphy cannot be described as the solution to french youth unemployment , as though one could rest on a slogan such as : “ they lack young people , our young people lack jobs – what a perfect match ! ” this widespread senti@@ ment ir@@ responsi@@ bly assumes that time is working in favor of france , regardless of whether it imple@@ ments structural reforms .
france ’ s current direction is a source of deep concern in germany , whose evolution should be seen in france as a source of inspiration – an example to be em@@ ulated , even if the country must not fall into self-@@ flag@@ ell@@ ation .
yet today ’ s debate in france over the german model reminds one e@@ eri@@ ly of the discussions that followed france ’ s defeat in the fran@@ co-@@ pr@@ us@@ si@@ an war .
in june 18@@ 71 , just after the war ended , the french stat@@ es@@ man l@@ é@@ on gam@@ bett@@ a dec@@ la@@ imed : “ our adver@@ sar@@ ies have won , because they ral@@ lied to their side fores@@ ight , discipline , and science . ” germany , it seems , can still r@@ ally those eternal values .
the major difference now is that the european uni@@ fication process rules out war – even economic war – between the two countries .
on the contrary , in the mirror of germany , the french must ask themselves fundamental questions .
have they made the right choices in terms of leaders and policies in recent decades ?
the places of power in france do not encourage mo@@ dest@@ y .
in his latest book , days of power , the former agriculture minister , bruno le ma@@ ire , writes con@@ desc@@ end@@ ingly of the building that houses his danish counter@@ part in copenhagen , which he compar@@ es to low-income housing .
with too much po@@ mp , too many stum@@ bling blocks , and a de@@ ar@@ th of dynam@@ ism , france today can and should learn from germany .
what hamas wants
hamas understands the political obli@@ ga@@ tions that it must meet in order to be fully accepted in the world community , but its leaders prefer to wait until they are fully empowered before exploring these issues .
moreover , hamas , like most palestini@@ ans , is trying to evaluate the best way forward in the peace process .
in their eyes , the current process produced years of in@@ action in negotiations , allowing for continued occupation and theft of palestinian lands .
as an example , hamas leaders point out that in the past year , with the moder@@ ate mahmoud ab@@ b@@ as in power , the israelis have not even negoti@@ ated with him .
so , from their point of view , israel is not going to rush to negotiate with any palestinian authority , whether it recognizes israel ’ s right to exist or not .
instead , the newly elected hamas leaders are pre@@ occupied with basic issues like preserving internal unity among palestini@@ ans , ending law@@ lessness , en@@ suring greater respect for the rule of law , fighting corruption , and re@@ forming palestinian governance .
most palestini@@ ans are in complete agreement with these priorities .
indeed , the latest public opinion poll among palestini@@ ans shows that 73 % feel as secure as or even more secure than they did before the election .
of the 70@@ 9 randomly selected palestini@@ ans who were surve@@ yed , 30 % said that they hope the new hamas government tac@@ kles corruption .
twenty-@@ two percent said that they hope is@@ ma@@ el h@@ ani@@ ye@@ h , hamas ’ s desig@@ nat@@ ed prime minister , will end the chaos in palestinian towns and provide internal security and the rule of law .
almost one in five hoped that unemployment would be addressed .
ironically , while the majority of palestini@@ ans voted a religious movement into power , only 1 % of those poll@@ ed said that hamas ’ s priority should be to implement islamic law in palestine .
while the poll showed that an overwhelming 73 % of palestini@@ ans still support a peace deal with israel , they are not confident that any deal is around the corner .
el@@ even percent of the respon@@ dents said that the prisoner issue should be the most important priority for the new government – nearly twice the number who said that a peace settlement with israel should be the top priority .
more than 8,000 palestini@@ ans are held in israeli prisons , many without charge or trial .
nevertheless , 62 % of palestini@@ ans said that they believe hamas should change its position regar@@ ding recognition of israel .
it is difficult for an international superpower like the us or a regional one like israel to realize that a group or a people dare to have priorities different from theirs .
but palestini@@ ans have shown over the years that they are a proud people who will not cave in just because the other side is milit@@ arily or politically more powerful .
in any case , hamas cannot be bl@@ amed for using america ’ s push for democracy to at@@ tain popular goals .
after all , anyone who wants to be re-@@ elected must give priority to the needs of their own people and not necessarily to the demands of the international community .
only when elected representatives deal with the day-to-day issues that face their people can they begin to tackle external negotiations .
what is clear is that hamas and the palestini@@ ans want an end to the 3@@ 8-@@ year israeli occupation , and that selling palestini@@ ans the same plans that were sold to the pl@@ o will not work .
if israel and the international community are genuinely serious about ending the occupation , hamas will cooperate .
while hamas must be flexible in dealing with legitimate requests by the international community , the international community is obli@@ ged to provide an effective road map to peace .
once palestini@@ ans are convinced that there is an opportunity for genuine peace and independence , they will press hamas to act on it – or ele@@ ct a party that will .
clearly , the international community has lac@@ ked the political will to press israel to change .
for the time being , and until this will is found , the world should give hamas time to deal with the daily needs of palestini@@ ans .
once the possibility of serious negotiations appears , a hamas that has improved the lives of ordinary palestini@@ ans will be in a position to carry out the negotiations that will be needed for a historic compromise .
what happened to india ?
chicago – emerging markets around the world – brazil , china , india , and russia , to name the largest – are slowing .
one reason is that they continue to be dependent , directly or indi@@ rectly , on exports to advanced industrial countries .
slow growth there , especially in europe , is economically depressing .
but a second reason is that they each have important weak@@ nesses , which they have not overcome in good times .
for china , it is exc@@ essive reli@@ ance on fix@@ ed-@@ asset investment for growth .
in brazil , low savings and various institutional im@@ pedi@@ ments keep interest rates high and investment low , while the educational system does not serve significant parts of the population well .
and russia , despite a very well educated population , continues to be reli@@ ant on commodity industries for economic growth .
hardest to understand , though , is why india is under@@ performing so much relative to its potential .
indeed , annual gdp growth has fallen by five percentage points since 2010 .
for a country as poor as india , growth should be what americans call a “ no-@@ brain@@ er . ”
it is largely a matter of providing public goods : basic infrastructure like roads , bridges , ports , and power , as well as access to education and basic health care .
and , unlike many equally poor countries , india already has a very strong entrepreneurial class , a reasonably large and well-@@ educated middle class , and a number of world-class corporations that can be en@@ listed in the effort to provide these public goods .
satisfying the demand for such goods is itself a source of growth .
but , also , a reliable road creates tremendous additional activity , as trade increases between connected areas , and myri@@ ad businesses , restaurants , and hotels spring up along the way .
as india did away with the st@@ ulti@@ fying license ra@@ j in the 1990 ’ s , succ@@ essive governments understood the imperative of economic growth , so much so that the b@@ har@@ ati@@ ya jan@@ ata party ( b@@ j@@ p ) con@@ tested the 2004 election on a pro-@@ development platform , en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated in the slogan , “ india shining . ”
but the b@@ j@@ p-@@ led coalition lost that election .
whether the de@@ bac@@ le reflected the b@@ j@@ p ’ s unfortunate choice of coalition partners or its emphasis on growth when too many indians had not benef@@ ited from it , the lesson for politicians was that growth did not provide elec@@ toral rewards .
in any event , that election suggested a need to spread the benefits of growth to rural areas and the poor .
there are two ways of going about that .
the first , which is harder and takes time , is to increase in@@ com@@ e-@@ generating capabilities in rural areas , and among the poor , by improving access to education , health care , finance , water , and power .
the second is to increase voters ’ spending power through popu@@ list subsidies and transfers , which typically tend to be directed toward the politically influential rather than the truly nee@@ dy .
in the years after the b@@ j@@ p ’ s loss , with a few not@@ able exceptions , india ’ s political class decided that traditional popu@@ li@@ sm was a sur@@ er route to re-@@ election .
this perception also accor@@ ded well with the medi@@ an ( typically poor ) vot@@ er ’ s low expectation of government in india – seeing it as a source of spo@@ radi@@ c hand@@ outs rather than of reliable public services .
for a few years , the momentum created by previous reforms , together with strong global growth , carried india forward .
politicians saw little need to vote for further reforms , especially those that would upset powerful vest@@ ed interests .
but , while politicians spent the growth divi@@ dend on poorly targeted gi@@ ve@@ a@@ ways such as subsidi@@ zed petro@@ l and cooking gas , the need for further reform only increased .
for example , industri@@ alization requires a transparent system for ac@@ quir@@ ing land from farmers and tribal people , which in turn pres@@ up@@ poses much better land@@ -@@ ownership records than india has .
as demand for land and land prices increased , corruption became ramp@@ ant , with some politicians , industri@@ alists , and bureau@@ crats using the lack of transparency in land ownership and zon@@ ing to mis@@ appropriate assets .
india ’ s corrupt elites had moved from controlling licen@@ ses to cor@@ ner@@ ing newly valuable resources like land .
the resource ra@@ j rose from the ashes of the license ra@@ j .
india ’ s citizen@@ ry eventually re@@ acted .
an ec@@ lec@@ tic mix of ide@@ alistic and opport@@ uni@@ stic politicians and ngos mobili@@ zed people against land ac@@ quisi@@ tions .
with investig@@ ative journalists getting into the act , land acquisition became a political land mine .
moreover , key institutions , such as the comp@@ tro@@ ll@@ er and audi@@ tor general and the ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary , sta@@ ffed by an increasingly angry middle class , also launched investig@@ ations .
as evidence emerged of widespread corruption in contracts and resource allo@@ cation , ministers , bureau@@ crats , and high-@@ level corporate officers were arrested , and some have spent long periods in jail .
the coll@@ ateral effect , however , is that even honest officials are now too frightened to help corporations to navigate india ’ s ma@@ ze of bureaucracy .
as a result , industrial , mining , and infrastructure projects have ground to a halt .
popu@@ list government spending and the inability of the supply side of the economy to keep pace has , in turn , led to elevated inflation , while indian households , worried that no asset looks safe , have taken to investing in gold .
because india does not produce much gold itself , these purch@@ ases have contributed to an ab@@ normally wide curr@@ ent-@@ account deficit .
not much more was required to dam@@ pen foreign investors ’ enthusiasm for the india story , with the rupe@@ e falling significantly in recent weeks .
as with the other major emerging markets , india ’ s fate is in its own hands .
hard times tend to concentrate minds .
if its politicians can take a few steps to show that they can overcome narrow partisan interests to establish the more transparent and efficient government that a middle-@@ income country needs , they could quickly re-@@ energi@@ ze india ’ s enormous engines of potential growth .
otherwise , india ’ s youth , their hopes and ambi@@ tions frustrated , could decide to take matters into their own hands .
what happened to mohamed al-@@ han@@ ash@@ i ?
new york – mohammed al-@@ han@@ ash@@ i was a 3@@ 1@@ -year-old yemen@@ i citizen who was held at gu@@ ant@@ á@@ nam@@ o bay without charge for seven years .
on june 3 , while i was visiting gu@@ ant@@ á@@ nam@@ o with other journalists , the press office there issued a ter@@ se announcement that al-@@ han@@ ash@@ i had had been found dead in his cell – an “ apparent suicide . ”
because my commercial flight was can@@ cel@@ ed , i got a ride back to the united states on a military transport .
i happened to be se@@ ated next to a military physician who had been flown in to do the autop@@ sy on al-@@ han@@ ash@@ i .
when would there be an investigation of the death , i asked him ? “ that was the investigation , ” he replied .
the military had investig@@ ated the military .
this “ apparent suicide ” seemed immediately suspicious to me .
i had just tou@@ red those cells : it is literally impossible to kill yourself in them .
their inter@@ i@@ ors resemble the inside of a smooth plastic jar ; there are no hard edges ; hoo@@ ks fold down ; there is no bed@@ ding that one can use to str@@ angle ones@@ elf .
can you bang your head against the wall until you die , theoretically , i asked the doctor ? “ they check on prisoners every three minutes , ” he said .
you ’ d have to be fast .
the story sm@@ elled even worse after a bit of digging .
al-@@ han@@ ash@@ i , it turned out , had been elected by the deta@@ ine@@ es to serve as their representative .
( the gen@@ eva conven@@ tions call for this process but the us did not give it any formal recognition ) .
as their desig@@ nat@@ ed representative , al-@@ han@@ ash@@ i knew which prisoners had cla@@ imed to have been tortured or abused , and by whom .
on january 17 , al-@@ han@@ ash@@ i , according to his fellow prisoner bin@@ y@@ am mohamed ( who has since been released ) , was sum@@ mon@@ ed to a meeting with the admi@@ ral of gu@@ ant@@ á@@ nam@@ o and the head of the guard force there .
he never returned to his cell .
he was taken to the psychiatric ward , where , according to another prisoner who had been there , he was kept until he died .
can you kill yourself in the psy@@ ch ward ?
according to cor@@ t@@ ney busch of rep@@ rie@@ ve , a british organization that represents gu@@ ant@@ á@@ nam@@ o deta@@ ine@@ es , there is video running on prisoners in the psychiatric ward at all times , and there is a guard posted there continually , too .
the day after al-@@ han@@ ash@@ i died , the nurse and psychologist had shown a group of journalists of which i was a part an odd@@ ly defen@@ sive display of how hun@@ ger-@@ striking prisoners are bound in restra@@ int chairs when being “ enter@@ ally fed ” ( that is , for@@ ce-@@ fed ) .
al han@@ ash@@ i , the press office at gu@@ ant@@ á@@ nam@@ o not@@ ed , had for@@ mer@@ ly been a hunger stri@@ ker .
it is worth considering how easy it would be to do away with a trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ome prisoner being for@@ ce-@@ fed by merely adju@@ sting the cal@@ orie level .
if it is too low , the prisoner will star@@ ve , but too high a level can also kill , since deliber@@ ate liquid over@@ feeding by tube , to which gu@@ ant@@ á@@ nam@@ o prisoners have reported being subje@@ cted , causes v@@ om@@ iting , diarrhea , and deadly de@@ hydra@@ tion that can stop one ’ s heart .
i have been putting questions to l@@ t. commander brook de@@ walt , the head spo@@ kes@@ man for the gu@@ ant@@ á@@ nam@@ o press office , about how al-@@ han@@ ash@@ i died , for eight weeks now .
according to the yemen@@ i embassy in washington , al-@@ han@@ ash@@ i ’ s body was re@@ patri@@ ated in mid-@@ august .
al jazeera has reported that the yemen@@ i government announced only what the us had – that al-@@ han@@ ash@@ i had died from “ as@@ phy@@ xi@@ ation . ”
when i not@@ ed to de@@ walt that self-@@ stran@@ gu@@ lation was impossible , he said he would get back to me when the inquiry – now including a na@@ val criminal investigation – was completed .
i have yet to receive an answer .
the yemen@@ i government , too , notes that they have yet to receive the cor@@ oner ’ s report from the us .
an investigation by the military of the death of its own prisoners viol@@ ates the gen@@ eva conven@@ tions , which demand that illness , transfer , and death of prisoners be registered independently with a neutral authority ( such as the ic@@ r@@ c ) , and that deaths be investig@@ ated independently .
if governments let no outside entity investigate the circumstances of such deaths , what will keep them from “ disappearing ” wh@@ om@@ ever they take into cu@@ sto@@ dy , for whatever reason ?
i sent de@@ walt a copy of the relevant section of the gen@@ eva conven@@ tions and asked how the us military ’ s handling of al-@@ han@@ ash@@ i ’ s death con@@ forms to it .
actually , i sent it twice .
again , no answer .
was al-@@ han@@ ash@@ i sui@@ ci@@ dal ?
bin@@ y@@ am mohamed told the associated press that al-@@ han@@ ash@@ i was a positive person ( and , one can assume , a natural leader ) who would never consider suicide .
he had been in cu@@ sto@@ dy for seven years without a lawyer , and killed himself just two weeks after having finally been assigned one ?
that lawyer , elizabeth gil@@ son , probably knows al-@@ han@@ ash@@ i ’ s state of mind before he died , but the us government will not allow her to talk about it .
what happened to mohamed al-@@ han@@ ash@@ i , and why ?
the fact that no one can answer this question yet means that even in barack obama ’ s america , as in stalin ’ s russia or ah@@ ma@@ din@@ eja@@ d ’ s iran , people can simply be disappeared without trial .
the world ’ s la@@ w-@@ ab@@ i@@ ding governments and ordinary citizens should call and email de@@ walt , the pentagon , and the white house press office to demand answers .
a young man with a great deal of potentially com@@ promising information died under suspicious circumstances in us cu@@ sto@@ dy .
the facts concern@@ ing his case must be independently veri@@ fied .

what have climate activists learned ?
copenhagen – advoc@@ ates of dra@@ stic cuts in carbon-@@ dioxide emissions now speak a lot less than they once did about climate change .
climate campaig@@ ners changed their approach after the collapse of the copenhagen cli@@ ma@@ te-@@ change summit last december and the revelation of mistakes in the united nations climate panel ’ s work – as well as in response to growing public skep@@ ticism and declining interest .
although some activists still rely on scare tactics – witness the launch of an advertise@@ ment depic@@ ting the bom@@ bing of anybody who is hes@@ it@@ ant to embrace carbon cuts – many activists now spend more time high@@ lighting the “ benefits ” of their policy prescription .
they no longer dwell on im@@ pen@@ ding climate do@@ om , but on the economic wind@@ fall that will result from embracing the “ green ” economy .
you can find examples all over the world , but one of the best is in my home country , denmark , where a govern@@ ment-@@ ap@@ pointed committee of academics recently presented their suggestions for how the country could go it alone and become “ fossil fu@@ el-@@ free ” in 40 years .
the goal is breath@@ taking : more than 80 % of denmark ’ s energy supply comes from fossil fuels , which are dramatically cheaper and more reliable than any green energy source .
i atten@@ ded the committee ’ s launch and was star@@ tled that the “ climate commission ” barely mentioned climate change .
this om@@ is@@ sion is understandable , since one country acting alone cannot do much to stop global warming .
if denmark were indeed to become 100 % fos@@ sil@@ -free by 2050 , and remain so for the rest of the century , the effect , by 2100 , would be to delay the rise in average global temperature by just two weeks .
instead of focusing on climate change , the climate commission hyp@@ ed the benefits that denmark would experience if it led the shift to green energy .
unfortunately , on in@@ spe@@ ction these benefits turn out to be ill@@ us@@ ory .
being a pioneer is hardly a guarantee of ri@@ ches .
germany led the world in putting up solar panels , funded by € 47 billion in subsidies .
the lasting legacy is a massive bill , and lots of inefficient solar technology sitting on roo@@ ft@@ ops throughout a fairly clou@@ dy country , delivering a trivial 0.@@ 1 % of its total energy supply .
denmark itself has also already tried being a gre@@ en-@@ energy innovator – it led the world in embracing wind power .
the results are hardly inspiring .
denmark ’ s wind industry is almost completely dependent on taxpa@@ yer subsidies , and dan@@ es pay the highest electricity rates of any industrialized nation .
several studies suggest that claims that one-@@ fifth of denmark ’ s electricity demand is met by wind are an exagger@@ ation , in part because much of the power is produced when there is no demand and must be sold to other countries .
the sorry state of wind and solar power shows the massive challenge that we face in trying to make today ’ s technology competitive and efficient .
direc@@ t-@@ current lines need to be constructed to carry solar and wind energy from sunny , win@@ dy areas to where most people live .
storage mechanisms need to be invented so that power is not interrupted whenever there is no sunshine or wind .
pro@@ pon@@ ents of carbon cuts argue that gre@@ en-@@ energy technologies only seem more expensive , because the price of fossil fuels does not reflect the cost of their impact on the climate .
but allowing for this would make little difference .
the most comprehensive economic meta@@ -@@ study shows that total future climate impacts would justify a tax of around € 0.@@ 0@@ 1 per liter of petro@@ l ( $ 0.@@ 0@@ 6 per gallon in the united states ) – an amount dwar@@ fed by the taxes already imposed by most european countries .
despite the fact that changing from fossil fuels to green energy requires a total economic transformation , denmark ’ s climate commission cla@@ imed that the price tag would be next to nothing .
the commission reached this conclusion by assuming that the cost of not embracing its recommen@@ ded policy would be massive .
the commission believes that over the next four decades , fos@@ sil@@ -@@ fuel costs will climb shar@@ ply , because sources will dry up and governments will place massive taxes on fossil fuels .
but this flies in the face of most evidence .
there is clearly plenty of cheap coal for hundreds of years , and with new cra@@ cking technology , gas is becoming more abundant .
even oil supplies are likely to be significantly boo@@ sted by non-@@ conventional sources like tar sands .
by the same token , the prediction that governments will impose massive carbon taxes has little basis in reality .
such assumptions seem like a poor framework on which to build significant public policy , and seem to ignore the substantial cost of eliminating fossil fuels , which is likely to amount to at least 5 % of gdp per year .
the shift away from fossil fuels will not be easy .
trying to force carbon cuts instead of investing first in research puts the cart before the horse .
breakthroughs do not result automatically from a combination of taxes on fossil fuels and subsidies for pres@@ ent-@@ day green energy : despite the massive out@@ lays associated with the kyoto protocol , participating countries ’ investment in r &amp; d as a percentage of gdp did not increase .
the change in message after the disaster of the copenhagen summit was probably inevitable .
but the real change that is needed is the realization that dra@@ stic , early carbon cuts are a poor response to global warming – no matter how they are packaged .
what if not all goods are compatible ?
it is an ab@@ i@@ ding conc@@ eit of our age that all good ideas go together .
truth and reconciliation , peace and justice , even justice and truth : these are only some of the worthy ambi@@ tions for human society that are routinely presented as totally re@@ conc@@ il@@ able .
but the st@@ ony reality is that it is by no means obvious that they are .
of course , in societies that are basically in good shape , both psych@@ ologically and materi@@ ally , such moral fab@@ les - such wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking , really - rarely do much harm and can often do consider@@ able good .
think of the current mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ alist fab@@ les that we in the west have con@@ co@@ cted for ourselves in order to cope with the dilemmas and challenges of mass immigration from the non-@@ european world .
in this piece of inspired over@@ simpli@@ fication , cultural &apos; diversity &apos; is inv@@ ari@@ ably seen as a bo@@ on rather than a threat .
yet one does not have to be a follo@@ wer of j@@ org hai@@ der or the late p@@ im for@@ tu@@ yn to know that , whatever the gains have been , whether in terms of economic growth or even the wi@@ dening of cultural experience in the west , much has and is being lost .
at the very least , the national cultures of the major western countries - their deep structures of ideology , taste , and aesthetics - are being changed , as new peoples , with new assumptions , demand that their sense of the world be taken into account .
sometimes those changes can be for the worse .
think , say , of how in much of western europe the only way that new immigr@@ ants and their host culture are re@@ conc@@ iled is through a culture of consumption and materi@@ alism - that is , a culture of the lowest common denomin@@ ator .
still , it is prefer@@ able that this culture of the supermarket pre@@ va@@ ils , rather than one in which everyone &apos;s gods , habits , and beliefs are in perpe@@ tual conflict .
although the moral and cultural simpli@@ fi@@ cations of mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ alism may have done the west little actual harm , the same cannot be said about poorer parts of the world .
specialists in human rights , conflict resolution , humanitarian relief , and democra@@ cy@@ -@@ building tend to see themselves as co@@ workers stri@@ ving toward a &apos; holistic &apos; solution , and those in need as requ@@ ir@@ ing all those elements in their historical cure .
most activists in these fields , not to mention their allies in private philanthro@@ pies and international organizations like the un , believe that they need to work together - that humanitarian emergen@@ cies are the product of human rights crises and the former cannot be seriously addressed unless and until the lat@@ ter are as well .
the stark truth , however , is that the moral imper@@ atives of each activity are star@@ k@@ ly different .
to put the matter cru@@ d@@ ely , the human rights activist is a moral absolu@@ tist p@@ ar excellence .
he or she must uph@@ old human rights standards , and , above all , human rights law to the letter or risk seeing the entire enterprise come un@@ stuck .
in contrast , human@@ it@@ arians are me@@ li@@ ori@@ sts .
their first job is to get the desper@@ at@@ el@@ y-@@ needed aid that often they alone can deliver to populations in need and in danger .
in the absence of some military force to protect them ( in itself a mixed blessing , as interventions from somalia to bosnia demonstrated ) , these humanitarian groups must negotiate access with criminal war@@ lords , oppres@@ sive governments , and war criminals .
in contrast to human rights activists , they cannot and must not be puri@@ sts .
what is at stake here is far more than some easily resolved question about a division of labor .
a human rights activist may want to see an oppres@@ sive regime over@@ thrown , may believe that this is the only long-term solution .
a humanitarian , by contrast , may want to feed a population , knowing full well that food aid could streng@@ then the oppres@@ sive regime .
what takes place in the interface of human rights and human@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism is often the conflict of two rights .
so far , at least , those who wish for a better world , and who participate in the strug@@ gles for it either as activists or as sym@@ path@@ i@@ zers , have refused to face the tragic possibility that they will have to choose between good actions , and between moral imper@@ atives .
such rel@@ uc@@ tance is understandable , for the choice is almost like being forced to choose death over life .
yet , as africa burns , as the aids pandemic spreads , and as it becomes clear@@ er that the material means at the disposal of those who a@@ che for a better world do not match their moral aspirations , such choices will become more and more pressing .
the less willing we are to ask harsh questions about human@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism and human rights , peace and justice , truth and reconciliation , the longer we take refu@@ ge in self-@@ flat@@ tering fantas@@ ies about the fundamental re@@ conc@@ il@@ ability of all good efforts , the higher the cost will be when the moment of reck@@ oning comes .
ireland and the au@@ ster@@ ity debate
du@@ bli@@ n – both sides of the au@@ ster@@ ity debate that is now gri@@ pping economists and policymakers ci@@ te ireland ’ s experience as evidence for their case .
and , however much they try to position the country as a po@@ ster-@@ child , neither side is able to convince the other .
yet this tu@@ g-@@ of-@@ war is important , because it illustrates the complex range of arguments that are in play .
it also demonstrates why more conclu@@ sive economic policy making is proving so elu@@ sive .
here is a quick reminder of ireland ’ s sad recent economic history .
l@@ ul@@ led into com@@ plac@@ ency and excess by am@@ ple supplies of artifi@@ cially cheap finan@@ cing , ir@@ ish banks went on a len@@ ding bin@@ ge .
ir@@ responsible ris@@ k-@@ taking and exc@@ essive gre@@ ed out@@ pac@@ ed p@@ ru@@ den@@ tial regulation and super@@ vision .
the banking system ended up fu@@ eling massive specu@@ lation , including a huge run@@ -up in real-@@ estate prices , only to be brought to its knees when the bubbles popped .
unlike the many ir@@ ish households that lost jobs and part of their wealth , the banks were de@@ em@@ ed to be “ too big to fail , ” so ireland ’ s political elites interven@@ ed with state funding . but , by under-@@ esti@@ mating both the domestic and international aspects of the problem , the authorities transformed a banking problem into a national tragedy .
rather than restor@@ ing the banks to financial health and en@@ suring responsible behavior , the ir@@ ish economy as a whole was dragged down .
growth collapsed ; unemployment spi@@ ked . lac@@ king opportunities , emi@@ gration increased – a vivid reminder of how economic crises have w@@ reak@@ ed ha@@ vo@@ c on the country ’ s demographics throughout its history .
investors with@@ drew in dro@@ ves from what was once de@@ em@@ ed the “ cel@@ tic tiger . ”
the government had no choice but to request a bail@@ out from the “ tro@@ i@@ ka ” – the international mon@@ etary fund , the european central bank , and the european commission – thereby transfer@@ ring an important component of national economic governance to an ad ho@@ c , fragile , and sometimes feu@@ ding group of institutions .
while other struggling euro@@ zone members also turned to the tro@@ i@@ ka , ireland stands out in at least two not@@ able ways .
first , two democra@@ tic@@ ally-@@ elected governments have ste@@ ad@@ fa@@ stly implemented the agreed au@@ ster@@ ity programs with little need for wa@@ i@@ vers and modifi@@ cations – and thus without the associated political drama . second , despite enduring consider@@ able pain , ir@@ ish society has stuck with the program , st@@ aging few of the street prote@@ sts that have been common in other au@@ ster@@ ity-@@ hit countries .
all of this puts ireland in the middle of three important issues raised in the au@@ ster@@ ity deb@@ ates : whether orthodo@@ x policy , with its heavy emphasis on immediate budget cuts , can restore conditions for growth , employment gains , and financial stability ; whether the benefits of euro@@ zone mem@@ ber@@ ship still out@@ weigh the costs for countries that must re@@ structure their economies ; and how a small , open economy should strategi@@ cally position itself in today ’ s world .
au@@ ster@@ ity ’ s suppor@@ ters point to the fact that ireland is on the verge of “ gradu@@ ating ” from the tro@@ i@@ ka ’ s program .
growth has res@@ um@@ ed , finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ risk pre@@ mia have fallen shar@@ ply , foreign investment is picking up , and exports are boom@@ ing . all of this , they argue , provides the basis for sustainable growth and declining unemployment .
ireland , they conclude , was right to stay in the euro@@ zone , especially because small , open economies that are unan@@ ch@@ ored can be easily buff@@ eted by a fluid global economy .
“ not so fast , ” says the other side .
the cri@@ tics of au@@ ster@@ ity point to the fact that ir@@ ish gdp has still not returned to its 2007 level .
unemployment remains far too high , with alarming levels of long-term and youth job@@ lessness . public debt remains too high as well , and , making matters worse , much more of it is now o@@ wed to official rather than private credi@@ tors ( which would complic@@ ate debt re@@ struc@@ turing should it become necessary ) .
the cri@@ tics reject the argument that small , open economies are necessarily better off in a mon@@ etary union , pointing to how well switzerland is cop@@ ing . and they lam@@ ent that euro@@ zone mem@@ ber@@ ship means that ireland ’ s “ internal de@@ valu@@ ations , ” which involve significant cuts in real wages , have not yet run their course .
the data on the “ ir@@ ish experiment ” – including the lack of solid counter@@ f@@ actu@@ als – are not conclu@@ sive enough for one side to de@@ clare a decisi@@ ve victory .
ireland provides insights that are helpful in understanding how soci@@ o@@ political systems , including economically devastated countries like c@@ yp@@ rus and greece , have cop@@ ed so far with sho@@ cks that were essentially un@@ thin@@ kable just a few years ago .
on my current visit , most of the ir@@ ish citizens with whom i have spoken say that the country had no alternative but to follow the path of au@@ ster@@ ity .
while they appreciate the urgent need for growth and jobs , they believe that this can be achieved only after ireland ’ s finan@@ ces are put back on a sound foot@@ ing .
they also argue that , given the banks ’ ir@@ responsibility , there is no quick way to promote sustained expansion .
ireland ’ s accumulation of wealth during its cel@@ tic tiger period , when the country sur@@ ged toward the top of europe ’ s economic league table , has also been an effective shock absor@@ ber .
this , together with fears about being left out in the geo@@ political cold ( despite the country ’ s historical links with britain and america ) , dam@@ p@@ ens ir@@ ish enthusiasm for economic experiments outside the euro@@ zone .
indeed , ir@@ ish society seems remarkably hes@@ it@@ ant to change course .
right or wrong , ireland will stick with au@@ ster@@ ity .
efforts to regain national control of the country ’ s destiny , the ir@@ ish seem to believe , must take time .
in some of europe ’ s other struggling countries , however , citizens may well prove less patient .
what is full employment ?
cambridge – in an important sense , the us economy is now at full employment .
the relatively tight labor market is causing wages to rise at an accelerating rate , because emplo@@ yers must pay more to attract and retain employees .
this has important implications for policymakers – and not just at the federal reserve .
consider this : average hour@@ ly ear@@ nings in may were 2.@@ 3 % higher than in may 20@@ 14 ; but , since the beginning of this year , hour@@ ly ear@@ nings are up 3.@@ 3 % , and in may alone rose at a 3.@@ 8 % rate – a clear sign of full employment .
the acceleration began in 2013 as labor markets started to ti@@ gh@@ ten .
average compen@@ sation per hour rose just 1.@@ 1 % from 2012 to 2013 , but then increased at a 2.@@ 6 % rate from 2013 to 20@@ 14 , and at 3.@@ 3 % in the first quarter of 2015 .
these wage increases will soon show up in higher price inflation .
the link between wages and prices is currently being off@@ set by the sharp decline in the price of oil and gasoline relative to a year ago , and by the streng@@ th@@ ening of the dollar relative to other curren@@ cies .
but , as these factors ’ impact on the overall price level dimin@@ ishes , the inflation rate will rise more rapidly .
accelerating wage growth impli@@ es that the economy is now at a point at which increases in demand created by easier mon@@ etary policy or expan@@ sion@@ ary fiscal policy would not achieve a sustained rise in output and employment .
instead , this demand would be channel@@ ed into higher wages and prices .
there are of course other definitions of full employment .
some would say that the united states is not at full employment , because 8.@@ 7 million people – about 6 % of those who are employed – are looking for work .
there are millions more who would like to work but are not actively looking , because they believe that there are no available jobs for people like themselves .
and an additional 6.@@ 7 million are working part@@ -@@ time but would like to work more hours per week .
in many cases , these unemployed and under@@ employed individuals are experiencing real hard@@ ship .
by that indic@@ ator , the us economy is not at full employment .
but , for the fed , it is , in the sense that exc@@ essi@@ vely easy mon@@ etary policy can no longer achieve a sustained increase in employment .
at the same time , other types of policies that change incentives or remove barriers can lead to increased employment and higher real incomes , without raising wage and price inflation .
consider , for example , the high rate of non-@@ employment among men aged 25 to 54 , a group too old to be in school and too young to retire .
more than 15 % of men in this age group are not employed .
among those in this age range who have less than a high school education , 35 % are not employed .
programs to provide market@@ -@@ relevant education and training should be able to raise employment among this group .
or consider the employment experience of men and women over age 65 . this group is eli@@ gible for social security ( pen@@ sions ) and medicare ( health insurance ) , and the majority are retired .
but experience shows that the decision to retire or to work fewer hours is influenced by the compen@@ sation that members of this group receive .
and this amount partly reflects the fact that employed people who collect social security and medicare are subject to the pay@@ roll tax that finan@@ ces them .
the pay@@ roll tax paid by employees is 6.@@ 65 % ( emplo@@ yers pay the same rate ) , and is in addition to the personal income tax .
moreover , because of the complex rules that govern the level of social security benefits , the older worker who pays this pay@@ roll tax is likely to receive no extra benefits .
for many older workers , the choice is not whether to work , but how much .
we now have less than full employment in the sense that the pay@@ roll tax encoura@@ ges older workers to work fewer hours than they otherwise would .
the affordable care act ( “ ob@@ ama@@ care ” ) also reduces hours worked , in two different ways .
first , for some individuals , working fewer hours reduces incomes enough to enti@@ tle them to a larger government subsi@@ dy for health insurance .
second , some emplo@@ yers are being in@@ cent@@ ed to reduce the number of working hours for individual employees , because , above a speci@@ fied number , ob@@ ama@@ care im@@ poses a larger burden on them .
as the minimum wage is increased , emplo@@ yers ’ incentive to substitute equipment or more skilled employees streng@@ th@@ ens .
this reduction in the demand for low-@@ skilled workers could be off@@ set by taking into account the hour@@ ly equivalent of transfer payments when calculating the minimum wage .
for example , someone who receives $ 8,000 a year in transfer payments ( such as food stam@@ ps , housing assistance , and the earned income tax credit ) might be de@@ em@@ ed to have received the equivalent of $ 4 an hour toward meeting the minimum wage .
that individual ’ s combined income would be achieved with a lower cost to the emplo@@ yer , increasing the individual ’ s ability to find employment .
i could easily extend this list .
the basic point is that employment can be increased , and unemployment decreased , by removing barriers to job creation and reducing margin@@ al tax rates .
by contrast , increasing demand by pro@@ longing easy mon@@ etary policy or expanding fiscal spending is likely to result in rising inflation rather than rising employment .
what is resilience ?
can@@ ber@@ ra – “ resilience , ” like love , is difficult to define .
yet everyone – from united nations secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general ban ki@@ -@@ moon to government agencies , company boards , and community groups – is talking about how to build or maintain it .
so , is resilience a useful concept or just a fle@@ eting buzz@@ word ?
to answer that question , we need to start with a different one : how much do you think you can change without becoming a different person ?
how much can an ecosystem , city , or business change before it looks and functions like a different kind of ecosystem , city , or business ?
all of these are self-organizing systems .
your body , for example , main@@ tains a constant temperature of approximately 37 degrees celsius .
if your body temperature rises , you start to sweat in order to cool down ; if your temperature falls , your muscles vibra@@ te ( shi@@ ver ) to warm up .
your body reli@@ es on negative feed@@ backs to keep it functioning in the same way .
that is basically the definition of resilience : the capacity of a system to absorb distur@@ b@@ ance , re-@@ organize , and keep functioning in much the same way as before .
but there are limits , or thres@@ holds , to a system ’ s resilience , beyond which it assumes a different way of functioning – a different identity .
many coral reefs that were once home to a rich diversity of fish , for example , have become alg@@ al or tur@@ f ecosystems with very few fish .
two main thres@@ holds dic@@ tate this change in coral reefs .
the more nutrients that enter the water ( run@@ -@@ off from nearby land ) , the more the algae are favor@@ ed , until , at some point , they take over .
likewise , if too many herbi@@ vor@@ ous fish are removed , algae gain a competitive advantage over the corals .
these two thres@@ holds interact : the more nutrients there are , the less fishing is needed to “ flip ” the system into the alg@@ al state ; and the fewer fish there are , the less nutrients are needed .
moreover , thres@@ holds can move as the environment changes .
in the coral reef example , both the nutri@@ ent and fish thres@@ holds fall as sea temperatures rise and the oceans become more aci@@ dic .
so , as climate change proce@@ eds , smaller incremental rises in nutri@@ ent levels and drops in fish stocks will flip coral reefs to alg@@ al states .
thres@@ holds also occur in social systems : think of fa@@ ds or , more seriously , ri@@ ot behavior in crowds .
in business , the debt / income ratio is a well-known threshold , one that can move in step with exchange rates .
threshold effects have also been identified in labor supply , transport services , and other determin@@ ants of companies ’ well-being .
given the importance of threshold effects , how can a system ’ s resilience be main@@ tained ?
for star@@ ters , making a system very resilient in one way can cause it to lose resilience in other ways .
so we have to understand and enhance general resilience – a system ’ s capacity to cope with a variety of sho@@ cks , in all aspects of its functioning .
from research on a variety of systems , the following attributes have been shown to con@@ fer general resilience :
· a high degree of diversity , especially response diversity ( different ways of doing the same thing , often mista@@ ken@@ ly thought of as “ redund@@ ancy ” ) .
· a relatively modular structure that does not over-@@ connect its components .
· a strong capacity to respond quickly to change .
· significant “ openness , ” allowing emi@@ gration and immigration of all components ( closed systems remain static ) .
· maintenance of adequate reserves – for example , seed banks in ecosystems or memory in social systems ( which speaks against ju@@ st-@@ in-@@ time supply services ) .
· encouragement of innovation and creativity .
· high social capital , particularly trust , leadership , and social networks .
· adaptive governance ( flexible , distribu@@ tive , and lear@@ n@@ ing-@@ based ) .
these attributes com@@ prise the essenti@@ als of a resilient system .
but resilience itself is neither “ good ” nor “ bad . ”
un@@ des@@ ir@@ able systems , such as dictator@@ ships and sal@@ ine landscapes , can be very resilient .
in these cases , the system ’ s resilience should be reduced .
moreover , it is impossible to understand or manage a system ’ s resilience at only one scale .
at least three must be included – the focal scale and at least one below and one above – for cross-@@ scale connections most often determine a system ’ s lon@@ ger-@@ term resilience .
most losses in resilience are unintended consequences of nar@@ row@@ ly focused optimi@@ zation ( like an “ efficiency ” drive ) that fails to recognize feedback effects on the focal scale that stem from changes produced by such optimi@@ zation at another scale .
resilience should not be confused with resistance to change .
on the contrary , trying to prevent change and distur@@ b@@ ance to a system reduces its resilience .
children who are prevented from playing in dirt grow up with com@@ promised immune systems .
building and maintaining resilience requires prob@@ ing its boundaries .
if a shift into a “ bad ” state has already happened , or is inevitable and will be irrever@@ sible , the only option is transformation into a different kind of system – a new way of living ( and making a living ) .
trans@@ form@@ ability and resilience are not op@@ pos@@ ites .
in order for a system to remain resilient at one scale , parts of it at other scales may have to transform .
in australia , for example , the mur@@ ra@@ y-@@ dar@@ ling basin cannot continue as a resilient agricultural region if all parts of it continue doing what they are doing now .
there simply is not enough water .
so some parts of it will have to transform .
of course , the need for transformation to create or maintain resilience may also affect the highest scale : if some countries and regions are to remain ( or become ) resilient soci@@ al-@@ ecological systems with high human well-being , it may be necessary to transform the global financial system .
transformation requires getting past denial , creating options for change , and supporting novelty and experimentation .
financial support from higher levels ( government ) all too often takes the form of help not to change ( bail@@ outs of to@@ o-@@ big@@ -to-@@ fail banks , for example ) , rather than help to change .
resilience , in short , is largely about learning how to change in order not to be changed .
certainty is impossible .
the point is to build systems that will be safe when they fail , not to try to build fail@@ -@@ safe systems .
what is the deficit end@@ game ?
re@@ y@@ k@@ ja@@ vik – no one yet has any real idea about when the global financial crisis will end , but one thing is certain : government budget defic@@ its are headed into the strato@@ sphere .
investors in the coming years will need to be persu@@ aded to hold mountains of new debt .
although governments may try to cra@@ m public debt down the thro@@ ats of local sa@@ vers ( by using , for example , their rising influence over banks to force them to hold a dis@@ proportion@@ ate quantity of government paper ) , they will eventually find themselves having to pay much higher interest rates as well .
within a couple years , interest rates on long-term us treas@@ ury notes could easily rise 3-@@ 4 % , with interest rates on other governments ’ paper rising as much , or more .
interest rates will rise to compen@@ sa@@ te investors both for having to accept a larger share of government bonds in their portfolio and for an increasing risk that governments will be temp@@ ted to inf@@ late away the value of their deb@@ ts , or even default .
in research that carmen rein@@ hart and i have done on the history of financial crises , we find that public debt typically dou@@ bles , even adju@@ sting for inflation , in the three years following a crisis .
many nations , large and small , are now well on the way to meeting this projection .
china ’ s government has clearly indicated that it will use any means necessary to back@@ stop growth in the face of a free fall in exports .
the chinese have $ 2 trillion in hard currency reserves to back up their promise .
president barack obama ’ s new budget calls for a stunning $ 1.@@ 75 trillion deficit in the united states , a multiple of the previous record .
even those countries that are not actively engaged in a fiscal or@@ gy are seeing their sur@@ pl@@ uses collapse and their defic@@ its so@@ ar , mainly in the face of falling tax revenues .
indeed , few governments have submitted remotely realistic budget projections , typically rel@@ ying on over@@ ly ro@@ sy economic scenarios .
unfortunately , in 2009 , the global economy will not be a bed of ro@@ ses .
income in the us and euro@@ -@@ area both appear to have declined at an annu@@ alized rate of roughly 6 % in the fourth quarter of 2008 ; japan ’ s gdp fell at perhaps twice that rate .
china ’ s claim that its gdp grew at a 6 % rate , during the end of last year , is suspect .
exports have collapsed throughout asia , including korea , japan , and singapore . arguably india , and to a lesser extent brazil , have been holding out a bit better .
but few emerging markets have reached a stage at which they can with@@ stand a sustained collapse in the developed economies , much less serve as substitute engines of global growth .
with the credit crisis still making it difficult for many small and medi@@ um-@@ size businesses to ob@@ tain even the minimal level of finan@@ cing necessary to maintain invent@@ ories and conduct trade , global gdp is on a preci@@ pi@@ ce in 2009 .
there is a real possibility that global growth will register its first contra@@ ction since world war ii .
in all likelihood , a sle@@ w of countries will see output dec@@ lines of 4-@@ 5 % in 2009 , with some@@ . having true depression level drops , of 10 % or more .
worse yet , unless financial systems spring back , growth could disap@@ point for years to come , especially in “ ground zero ” countries such as the united states , britain , ireland and spain . us long-term growth could be particularly dis@@ mal , as the obama administration ste@@ ers the country toward more european levels of welfare assistance and income re@@ distribution ,
countries with europe@@ an-@@ style growth rates could handle debt obli@@ ga@@ tions of 60 % of gdp when interest rates were low .
but , with deb@@ ts in many countries rising to 80 % or 90 % of gdp , and with today ’ s low interest rates clearly a temporary phenomenon , trouble is bre@@ wing .
many of the countries that are pil@@ ing on massive quantities of debt to ba@@ il out their banks have only te@@ pid medium term growth pro@@ spe@@ cts , raising real questions of sol@@ ven@@ cy and sustainability
italy , for example with a deb@@ t-@@ to-@@ income ratio already exce@@ eding 100 % , has been able to manage so far thanks to falling global rates .
but as deb@@ ts mount , and global interest rates rise , investors will become rightly nervous about the risk of debt re@@ struc@@ turing .
other countries , such as ireland , britain , and the us , started with a much stronger fiscal position , but may not be much better off when the smoke cle@@ ars .
exchange rates are another wild card .
asian central banks are still nerv@@ ously cl@@ inging to the dollar . but with the us printing debt and money like it is going out of style , it would appear the euro is set to appreciate against the dollar two or three years down the road , if the euro is still around , that is .
as debt moun@@ ts and the recession ling@@ ers , we are surely going to see a number of governments trying to ligh@@ ten their load through financial repres@@ sion , higher inflation , partial default , or a combinations of all three .
unfortunately , the end@@ game to the great recession of the 2000 ’ s will not be a pretty picture .
what is the dollar ’ s sustainable value ?
how much further will the dollar fall ?
or has it already fallen so far that it will now start to move back to a higher level ?
for travel@@ ers to the united states from europe or asia , us prices are dramatically lower than at home .
a hotel room or dinner in new york seems a bar@@ gain when compared to prices in london , paris , or tokyo .
and shop@@ pers from abroad are lo@@ ading up on a wide range of products before heading home .
but , despite this very tangible evidence , it would be wrong to conclude that us goods are now so cheap at the existing exchange rate that the dollar must rise from its current level .
although the goods and services that travel@@ ers buy may cost less in the us than abroad , the overall price of american products is still too high to erase the enormous trade imbalance between the us and the rest of the world .
to be sure , the falling dollar over the past few years has made american products more competitive and has caused the real value of us exports to rise shar@@ ply – by more than 25 % over the past three years .
but the trade deficit in 2007 nevertheless remained at more than $ 700 billion , or 5 % of gdp .
the large trade deficit and equally large current account deficit ( which includes net investment income ) impli@@ es that foreign investors must add $ 700 billion of us se@@ curi@@ ties to their portfoli@@ os .
it is their un@@ willingness to do so at the existing exchange rate that causes the dollar to fall relative to other curren@@ cies .
in falling , the dollar lo@@ wers the value of the dollar se@@ curi@@ ties in foreign portfoli@@ os when valued in euros or other home curren@@ cies , shrinking the share of dollars in investors ’ portfoli@@ os .
the weaker dollar also reduces the risk of future dollar decline , because it means that the dollar has to fall less in the future to shift the trade balance to a sustainable level .
while experts try to work this out in terms of portfolio balances , a more fundamental starting point is the fact that a us trade deficit means that americans receive more goods and services from the rest of the world than they send back – $ 700 billion more last year . the difference was finan@@ ced by transfer@@ ring stocks and bonds worth $ 700 billion .
the interest and divi@@ den@@ ds on those se@@ curi@@ ties will be paid by sending more “ pieces of paper ” .
and when those se@@ curi@@ ties mature , they will be re@@ finan@@ ced with new stocks and bonds .
it is un@@ thin@@ kable that the global economic system will continue in@@ definitely to allow the us to import more goods and services than it exports .
at some point , the us will need to start re@@ paying the enormous amount that it has received from the rest of the world .
to do so , the us will need a trade surplus .
so the key determin@@ ant of the dollar ’ s long-term value is that it must decline enough to shift the us trade balance from today ’ s deficit to a surplus .
that won ’ t happen anytime soon , but it is the direction in which the trade balance must continue to move .
and that means further de@@ preci@@ ation of the dollar .
an important factor in this process will be the future price of oil and the extent of us dependence on oil impor@@ ts .
in each of the past four years , the us impor@@ ted 3.@@ 6 billion barrels of oil .
at the current price of more than $ 140 a barrel , that impli@@ es an import cost of more than $ 500 billion . the higher the cost of oil , the lower the dollar has to be to achieve any given reduction in the size of the trade deficit .
so a rising oil price as measured in euros or yen impli@@ es a greater dollar fall , and therefore an even higher oil price when stated in dollars .
there is one further important consideration in thinking about the future value of the dollar : relative inflation rates in the us and abroad . the us trade deficit depends on the real value of the dollar – that is , the value of the dollar adju@@ sted for differences in price levels in the us and abroad .
if the us experiences higher inflation than our trading partners , the dollar ’ s nomin@@ al value must fall even further just to maintain the same real value .
the inflation differential between the dollar and the euro is now relatively small – only about one percentage point a year – but is greater relative to the yen and lower relative to the ren@@ min@@ bi and other high-@@ inflation curren@@ cies . over the longer run , however , inflation differenti@@ als could be a more significant force in determin@@ ing the dollar ’ s path .
what is the imf ’ s mission ?
berkeley – the international mon@@ etary fund has been one of the few bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ aries of the global economic crisis .
just two years ago , it was being down@@ sized , and serious people were asking whether it should be closed down .
since then , there has been a rene@@ wed demand for imf len@@ ding . members have agreed to a tri@@ pling of its resources .
it has been auth@@ orized to raise additional funds by selling its own bonds .
the fund is a bee@@ hive of activity .
but the crisis will not last forever . meanwhile , the imf ’ s cri@@ tics have not gone away ; they have merely fallen silent tempor@@ arily .
it needs to do so while it still has the world ’ s sym@@ pathetic ear .
the imf ’ s first role is to ass@@ ist countries that , as a result of domestic policies , experience bal@@ ance@@ -@@ of-@@ payments crises .
their governments have no choice but to borrow from the fund .
to safe@@ guard its resources – that is , to be sure that its share@@ holders are paid back – the fund must demand difficult policy adju@@ st@@ ments on the part of these bor@@ ro@@ wers .
the problem is that the imf has bought into the rhetoric of its cri@@ tics by agre@@ eing to “ stream@@ line ” its condi@@ tionality .
in fact , where structural weak@@ nesses are the source of problems , the fund should still require structural adju@@ st@@ ment as the price of its assistance .
by seem@@ ing to give ground on this point in the effort to win friends and influence people , the imf has created unnecessary con@@ fusion .
a second role for the imf is to act as a global reserve pool .
countries have accum@@ ulated large reserves in order to in@@ sure against sho@@ cks .
this is costly for poor economies , which could better use the resources for investment and consumption .
unfortunately , the recent demonstration of the vola@@ tili@@ ty of global financial markets only encoura@@ ges the tendency to stock@@ pile reserves .
it would be more efficient to pool the reserves of countries that need them at different times .
the imf has moved in this direction by creating a short-term liqui@@ dity facility through which countries with strong policies can draw from the fund up to five times their quot@@ a without condi@@ tionality .
but the st@@ l@@ f still requires a bur@@ den@@ some application process , which only mexico , colom@@ bia , and poland have been willing to end@@ ure .
this made sense so long as the imf ’ s resources were limited , as the application process allowed the fund to limit its li@@ ability .
but , with the tri@@ pling of resources , this rationale no longer exists .
the imf should categ@@ or@@ ically announce which countries quali@@ fy for the facility , automatically making them members of the pool .
a third role for the imf is macro@@ -@@ p@@ ru@@ den@@ tial super@@ vis@@ or .
recent events have made clear that someone needs to anticipate and warn of risks to global financial stability .
the g-@@ 20 suggests that the financial stability board ( fs@@ b ) , made up of national super@@ vis@@ ory authorities , should take the lead in these tasks .
the fund , through its ear@@ ly-@@ warning exercis@@ es and joint im@@ f-@@ world bank financial sector assess@@ ments , is to only play a supporting role .
but why the fs@@ b should head up this process is far from clear .
the imf , with its universal mem@@ ber@@ ship , is more representative , and it has a larger expert staff .
national super@@ vis@@ ors may be reluctant to sur@@ render this responsibility to a multi@@ lat@@ eral organization .
if so , this is short@@ sighted .
financial markets and institutions with global reach need a global macro@@ -@@ p@@ ru@@ den@@ tial regul@@ ator , not just a loo@@ sely organized college of super@@ vis@@ ors .
or it could be that national policymakers don ’ t trust the imf , given that it essentially missed the global financial crisis .
if so , the fund needs to win back their confidence .
this brings us to the imf ’ s fourth role , namely using its bul@@ ly pul@@ pit to warn of risks created by large-@@ country policies .
small countries are subject to market discipline , as any lat@@ vi@@ an will tell you .
but when large economies whose curren@@ cies are used internation@@ ally need more resources , they can just print more money .
not only do they feel less market discipline , but they are subject to less imf discipline , since they are not comp@@ elled to borrow from the fund .
but , as the sub-@@ prime mortgage de@@ bac@@ le reminds us , large countries ’ policies can place the global financial system at risk .
the fund , war@@ y of biting the hand that feeds it , has been reluctant to issue strong warn@@ ings in such instances .
but if the imf is to have a future , its management will have to issue stronger warn@@ ings about the next danger@@ ously large us curr@@ ent-@@ account deficit , the next unsustainable housing boom , or whatever large-@@ country problem succe@@ eds them .
there can be no more min@@ cing of words .
finally , the imf needs to coordinate reform of the international system .
if , in the long run , a su@@ pra@@ -@@ national unit , the special drawing right , is to replace national curren@@ cies in international use , then the fund will need to guide its development .
if stop@@ -@@ gap measures are required during the transition , the fund must provide leadership there as well .
so far , however , the innovative ideas for re@@ forming the international system have come from the united nations , 10 dow@@ ning street , and the people ’ s bank of china .
the fund has been not@@ able mainly for its silence .
the crisis is not yet forgotten , but the window is closing .
if the fund does not provide a clear vision of its future by then , the opportunity will have been missed .
what is the west ?
paris -- everyone everywhere has by now heard about the “ clash of civilizations . ”
in the 1950 ’ s , the french economist , alfred sau@@ vy had a comparable success with the expression “ third world . ”
one reason these phrases gain wide acceptance is their lack of clear definition .
the “ clash of civilizations , ” basically the west against the rest , is supposed to describe the world as it is .
in reality , the west is vague enough to include a vast array of areas without describing their uni@@ fying characteristics .
so what exactly is west ?
what does we@@ ster@@ ni@@ zation mean ?
why is japan considered western and china not ?
where does shanghai stand ?
is russia part of the west ?
from these un@@ certain@@ ties , we can conclude that the west is not a geographic entity .
it probably first established itself as a mindset when the greeks , 25 centuries ago , perceived themselves as western versus the ori@@ ental persi@@ ans .
since the west has lost any clear terri@@ torial basis since then , the phrase “ the west ” has become a universal not a local notion .
to be western or we@@ ster@@ ni@@ zed , above all , is a mindset which does not co@@ in@@ cide with any continent , nor with any specific nation or religion .
huntington ’ s mistake , it seems , was to contain the west inside national borders : there is no map of the west .
no map can work when some asian nations are western ( japan , taiwan ) , when non-@@ western groups ( muslims in europe ) live in supposedly western countries , when some eastern countries are partially we@@ ster@@ ni@@ zed and some western countries ( russia ) are not fully we@@ ster@@ ni@@ zed . eventually it looks easier to define the mental borders of the west than its terri@@ torial borders .
i believe that the west is a mindset defined by three fundamental traits that cannot easily be found in the so-called eastern civilizations : a passion for innovation , a capacity for self-@@ criticism , and gender equality .
‘ what is new ? ’ -- a personal gre@@ eting since the hell@@ eni@@ stic age – captures the essence of the western mind .
the non-@@ western@@ er , however , would rather place tradition above innovation .
but innovation as a fundamental value explains the scientific breakthroughs of the west versus the east . it explains un@@ avo@@ id@@ able conflicts with conservative non-@@ western societies and it also explains what we should call ‘ the we@@ ster@@ ni@@ zation of the west . ’
the west keeps destroying its own traditions , including its religions . the economist joseph schum@@ peter defined this process as one of “ creative destruction . ”
western conservatives are no less prone to creative destruction than western liberals : conservatives , indeed , are well known for inventing traditions . take the 19th century british prime minister benjamin dis@@ ra@@ eli , who invented most of the supposedly ancient traditions around the british mon@@ archy .
innovation in the west seems to be a never@@ -@@ ending , self-@@ transforming process .
self-@@ criticism , even more than innovation , is a defining characteristic of the west .
in most if not all non-@@ western civilizations , pride and self love exclu@@ de self-@@ criticism or at least the criticism of one ’ s civilization as such .
a true muslim or chinese scholar cannot be defined as a true chinese or a true muslim by being critical of his own world .
not so in the west .
the western scholar remains perfectly legitimate when putting to death western values : there is no chinese or muslim nie@@ tz@@ sche cla@@ iming that his own god is dead .
is there a chinese or a muslim mon@@ ta@@ ig@@ ne ready to write that the “ indian sav@@ ages ” may be wiser than us , as mon@@ ta@@ ig@@ ne did in 16@@ th century france ?
of course there must be some chinese or muslim mon@@ ta@@ ig@@ ne or nie@@ tz@@ sche , but they would not be considered be@@ ac@@ ons of their civilizations .
self-@@ criticism , not self-@@ love , and cultural rela@@ tivism are the nuts and bol@@ ts of the western mindset .
the same goes with gender equality .
this has not always been so . in the ancient greek , jewish , and christian religions , women were perceived as inferior to men .
but this notion has been con@@ ten@@ tious in the west for centuries . nowadays , gender equality has become the norm .
this is not the case in most non-@@ western civilizations .
some would argue that gender equality is a consequence of the moderni@@ zation process , not of we@@ ster@@ ni@@ zation .
this may be true , but the status of women is clearly one issue that puts non-@@ western muslims into opposition to the west .
if we accept the above definition of the west as a mindset , this leaves open three major questions : can the east be moderni@@ zed without being we@@ ster@@ ni@@ zed ?
where do we draw the line between west and east ?
will the west remain western ?
so far , there is no case in history of non-@@ western moderni@@ zation ; the dis@@ course on asian values , initially started in singapore , is basically a political dis@@ course .
it is after re@@ tool@@ ing their mindset towards innovation and self-@@ criticism that asian countries have become modern .
this does not make them less asian .
contemporary kore@@ ans or japanese remain fully korean or japanese but are closer to a western@@ er than they would be to their own ancestors .
similarly , a modern egyptian or a modern saudi will be more on p@@ ar with a french or an american than they would be with an ancient arab .
does this we@@ ster@@ ni@@ zation make the egyptian or the saudi less authentic arab@@ s ?
such a debate does take place within all eastern societies , which leads us to the real clash of civilizations : all societies today are fragmented between we@@ ster@@ ni@@ zers and non-@@ we@@ ster@@ ni@@ zers .
this clash within civilizations on what moderni@@ zation means is more significant than huntington ’ s alle@@ ged conflict between geographical entities .
the controversy on the essential meaning of moderni@@ zation , also known as an identity crisis , does impact western countries as well .
vast groups who live in the west , western and non-@@ western fundament@@ alists , fight the un@@ ending we@@ ster@@ ni@@ zation process in the name of tradition .
many would like to stop the engine by using various gu@@ ises like ecology or identity , but a western society where you could not start your day by asking ‘ what &apos;s new ? ’ would not be western any more .
what is wrong with sub-saharan africa ?
the world ’ s economic powers finally appear to be closing ran@@ ks behind efforts to address global poverty and economic under@@ development .
at this year ’ s world economic forum , within the g-@@ 8 , and elsewhere , the consensus that something needs to be done has been as clear and as it is welcome .
but , for some of the world ’ s poorest regions , particularly sub-saharan africa ( ss@@ a ) , a commitment to help may not be enough .
basic indi@@ cators of economic and social development show ss@@ a la@@ gging far behind other developing areas .
the average income per capita of ss@@ a countries in 2000 was less than half that for all developing countries , about 40 % of the level of east asian and pacific developing countries , and less than 25 % that of latin america and the caribbean countries .
similarly , life expectancy at birth in ss@@ a countries la@@ gged 16 years behind the develop@@ ing-@@ country average , 14 years behind countries in south asia , and 21 years behind countries in east asia , latin america , and the caribbean .
in combined gross en@@ ro@@ l@@ ment in primary , secondary and higher education , ss@@ a countries stood 19 % below the average for developing countries , 11 % below south asian countries , 29 % below east asia and the pacific , and 32 % below latin america and the caribbean .
until the late 1800 ’ s , most of africa was un@@ explored and occupied by hunter-@@ gather@@ ers and practition@@ ers of subsi@@ stence agriculture .
land was relatively abundant and allo@@ cated by tribal chie@@ fs without regard to western@@ -@@ style property rights .
the only terri@@ torial units resem@@ bling those that exist today were ethiopia , liberia , and south africa .
during the burst of imperial expansion in africa that followed national integration and trade liber@@ alization in europe , coloni@@ al powers showed little interest in del@@ ine@@ ating coloni@@ al national boundaries based on cultural or ethnic consider@@ ations ; they cared only about raw materials and markets .
the berlin conference of 18@@ 85 fixed the borders of europe ’ s african colonies so that they included within them a large variety of languages , religions , and ethnic groups .
most ss@@ a countries atta@@ ined national independence some time after the end of the second world war , as the british , french , bel@@ gian , and portu@@ gu@@ ese empires un@@ ra@@ vel@@ ed ( germany had already lost its colonies after 1918 ) .
thus , ss@@ a countries have only enjoyed independence for a short period in comparison with , say , south america , where countries had their wars of independence around 18@@ 10-@@ 18@@ 20 and achieved some type of constitu@@ tional government by 18@@ 50-@@ 18@@ 80 .
the legacy of arbitr@@ arily drawn borders and limited political centr@@ alization meant that in many ss@@ a countries rem@@ nan@@ ts of the coloni@@ al experience continue to play a big role in defining the institutional landscape , such as the civil service and public administration , educational system , and economic infrastructure .
to be sure , many countries adopted english , french , or portu@@ gu@@ ese as their official languages , and european mission@@ aries , who often followed in the coloni@@ zers ’ foot@@ steps , had success in transmit@@ ting their religious practices to local populations .
nevertheless , linguistic variety and ethnic di@@ visions remain more important than in most of the developing world , and tribal aff@@ ili@@ ation has continued to hin@@ der the emergence of uni@@ fying national identities .
moreover , self-@@ rule has not brought many democra@@ tically elected regimes .
instead , anti-@@ coloni@@ al liberation leaders often developed personality cul@@ ts and ho@@ gged power for decades .
mono@@ poli@@ zation of political power led , in turn , to ramp@@ ant cr@@ ony@@ ism and corruption , which sti@@ fl@@ ed economic and social development .
recent data on perceived corruption in public trans@@ actions show the ss@@ a countries with the lowest average score for all developing regions .
only botswana and namibia achieved respe@@ ctable scores , while the worst offen@@ ders were camer@@ oon , uganda , kenya , angola , madagascar , and nigeria .
weak national unity has under@@ pinn@@ ed an even more dama@@ ging pattern .
since the 1990 ’ s , many of the world ’ s armed conflicts have taken place in ss@@ a countries .
congo and les@@ oth@@ o each experienced two conflicts during the decade , while civil stri@@ fe ra@@ va@@ ged sierra leone , ivory coast , liberia , congo , and sudan .
this deter@@ red not only foreign and domestic investment , but , more fundamentally , the formation of the very institutions needed for successful economic development .
sustained economic growth requires , everywhere , the accumulation of physical and human capital , as well as the acquisition of technological capabilities .
this process does not occur in a historical vacuum , devo@@ id of the influence of powerful social and political factors . structure , institutions , and policies are critical determin@@ ants , as is the availability of qualified technical and administra@@ tive personnel .
indeed , the availability of a highly qualified bureaucracy in both south korea and taiwan – and before that in their model country , japan – was a necessary pre@@ condition for achieving rapid economic growth .
by contrast , the shortage in ss@@ a of scientific , technical , and administra@@ tive skills , such as those of engineers , natural scientists , managers , and technicians , is a key reason why the east asian “ miracle ” could not be re@@ produced there .
none of the pre@@ conditions of economic development will be met in ss@@ a until the legacy of coloni@@ alism and weak states that has defined the region is overcome .
developed countries can provide limited help by means of well-@@ focused , un@@ tied aid and technical assistance projects .
but success depends mainly on the emergence of dedicated , talented , and honest national and regional political leaders .
only such leaders can build up the legiti@@ macy needed to unite their countries , and only then will they be able to confront head on the many challenges that the region faces in shaking loose from the shack@@ les of back@@ war@@ dness .
what is wrong with terrorism ?
people all over the world react with visceral horror to attacks on civili@@ ans by al qua@@ e@@ da , by palestinian suicide bom@@ bers , by bas@@ que or che@@ chen se@@ para@@ ti@@ sts , or by ira mili@@ tants .
as there now seems to be a pause in the sp@@ ate of suicide bomb@@ ings and other terrorist ac@@ ts@@ -@@ -@@ if only moment@@ ar@@ y-@@ -@@ perhaps now is a moment to gra@@ pple with a fundamental question : what makes terrorist kill@@ ings any more worthy of con@@ dem@@ nation than other forms of murder ?
the special op@@ prob@@ ri@@ um associated with the word &quot; terrorism &quot; must be understood as a con@@ dem@@ nation of means , not ends .
of course , those who con@@ dem@@ n terrorist attacks on civili@@ ans often also reject the ends that the attac@@ kers are trying to achieve .
they think that a separate bas@@ que state , or the with@@ dra@@ wal of us forces from the middle east , for example , are not aims that anyone should be pursuing , let alone by violent means .
but the con@@ dem@@ nation does not depend on reje@@ cting the aims of the terrorists .
the reaction to the attacks of september 11 , 2001 on new york and washington and their like under@@ scores that such means are outrageous whatever the end ; they should not be used to achieve even a good end-@@ -@@ indeed , even if there is no other way to achieve it .
the normal balancing of costs against benefits is not allo@@ w@@ able here .
this claim is not as simple as it appears because it does not depend on a general moral principle forbi@@ dding all killing of non-@@ com@@ bat@@ ants .
similarly , those who con@@ dem@@ n terrorism as beyond the p@@ ale are usually not paci@@ fi@@ sts .
they believe not only that it is all right to kill soldiers and bomb muni@@ tions de@@ pots in times of war , but that in@@ fli@@ cting &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; on non-@@ com@@ bat@@ ants it is sometimes un@@ avoi@@ dab@@ le-@@ -@@ and morally per@@ mis@@ sible .
but if that is per@@ mis@@ sible , why is it wrong to aim directly at non-@@ com@@ bat@@ ants if killing them will have a good chance of in@@ ducing the enemy to ce@@ ase hosti@@ li@@ ties , with@@ draw from occupied territory , or grant independence ?
dying is bad , however one is killed .
so why should a civilian death be acceptable if it occurs as a side-@@ effect of combat that serves a worthy end , whereas a civilian death that is in@@ fli@@ cted deliberately as a means to the same end is a terrorist ou@@ trage ?
the distinction is not univers@@ ally accep@@ ted-@@ -@@ certainly not by the major bel@@ li@@ ger@@ ents in world war ii .
hiroshima is the most famous example of terror bom@@ bing , but the ger@@ mans , the japanese , and the british as well as the americans deliberately s@@ laugh@@ tered civilian non-@@ com@@ bat@@ ants in large numbers .
today , however , terrorism inspir@@ es widespread re@@ vul@@ sion , which in turn helps to justify military action against it .
so it is essential that the reason for that re@@ vul@@ sion become better understood .
the core moral idea is a prohi@@ bi@@ tion against a@@ iming at the death of a harm@@ less person .
everyone is presum@@ ed to be in@@ viol@@ able in this way until he himself becomes a danger to others ; so we are per@@ mitted to kill in self-@@ defense , and to attack enemy com@@ bat@@ ants in war .
but this is an exception to a general and strict requirement of respect for human life .
so long as we are not doing any harm , no one may kill us just because it would be useful to do so .
this minimal basic respect is o@@ wed to every individual , and it may not be viol@@ ated even to achieve valuable long-term goals .
however there are some activities , including legitimate self-@@ defense or warfare , that create an un@@ avo@@ id@@ able risk of harm to innocent parties .
this is true not only of violent military or police actions but also of peaceful projects like major construction in den@@ sely populated cities .
in those cases , if the aim is important enough , the activity is not morally prohi@@ bited provided due care is taken to minimize the risk of harm to innocent parties , consistent with the achievement of the aim .
the moral point is that we are obli@@ ged to do our best to avoid or minimize civilian casu@@ alties in warfare , even if we know that we cannot avoid them completely .
those deaths do not viol@@ ate the stri@@ c@@ test protection of human life-@@ -@@ that we may not aim to kill a harm@@ less person .
on the contrary , our aim is if possible to avoid such coll@@ ateral deaths .
of course , the victim ends up dead whether killed deliberately by a terrorist or regre@@ tt@@ ably as the side effect of an attack on a legitimate military target .
but in our sense of what we are o@@ wed morally by our fellow human beings , there is a huge difference between these two acts , and the attitudes they express toward human life .
so long as it remains an effective means for weak parties to ex@@ ert pressure on their more powerful enemies , terrorism cannot be expected to disappear .
but we should hope nonetheless that the recognition of its special form of contemp@@ t for humanity will spread , rather than being lost as a result of its recent successes .
what lies ahead in 2011 ?
new york – the global economy ends 2010 more divided than it was at the beginning of the year .
on one side , emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market countries like india , china , and the southeast asian economies , are experiencing robust growth . on the other side , europe and the united states face stag@@ nation – indeed , a japan@@ es@@ e-@@ style mal@@ a@@ ise – and stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly high unemployment .
the problem in the advanced countries is not a job@@ less recovery , but an ane@@ mic recovery – or worse , the possibility of a double-@@ dip recession .
this two-@@ track world poses some unusual risks .
while asia ’ s economic output is too small to pull up growth in the rest of the world , it may be enough to push up commodity prices .
meanwhile , us efforts to stimulate its economy through the federal reserve ’ s policy of “ quantitative e@@ asing ” may back@@ fire .
after all , in globalized financial markets , money looks for the best pro@@ spe@@ cts around the world , and these pro@@ spe@@ cts are in asia , not the us . so the money won ’ t go where it ’ s needed , and much of it will wind up where it ’ s not wanted – causing further increases in asset and commodity prices , especially in emerging markets .
given the high levels of excess capacity and unemployment in europe and america , quantitative e@@ asing is unlikely to trigger a b@@ out of inflation .
it could , however , increase anx@@ ie@@ ties about future inflation , leading to higher long-term interest rates – precisely the opposite of the fed ’ s goal .
this is not the only , or even the most important , down@@ side risk facing the global economy .
the gra@@ v@@ est threat comes from the wave of au@@ ster@@ ity sweeping the world , as governments , particularly in europe , confront the large defic@@ its brought on by the great recession , and as anx@@ ie@@ ties about some countries ’ ability to meet their debt payments contributes to finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ market inst@@ ability .
the outcome of premature fiscal con@@ soli@@ dation is all but for@@ et@@ old : growth will slow , tax revenues will dimin@@ ish , and the reduction in defic@@ its will be disap@@ pointing .
and , in our globally integrated world , the slow@@ down in europe will exac@@ erb@@ ate the slow@@ down in the us , and vice versa .
with the us able to borrow at recor@@ d-@@ low interest rates , and with the promise of high returns on public investments after a decade of negle@@ ct , it is clear what it should do .
a large-scale publi@@ c-@@ investment program would stimulate employment in the short term , and growth in the long term , leading in the end to a lower national debt .
but financial markets demonstrated their short@@ si@@ gh@@ tedness in the years prece@@ ding the crisis , and are doing so once again , by applying pressure for spending cuts , even if that impli@@ es reducing badly needed public investments .
moreover , political gridlock will ensure that little is done about the other fe@@ stering problems confron@@ ting the american economy : mortgage forec@@ lo@@ sures are likely to continue unab@@ ated ( legal compli@@ cations aside ) ; small and medi@@ um-@@ sized enter@@ pris@@ es are likely to continue to be star@@ ved of funds ; and the small and medi@@ um-@@ sized banks that traditionally provide them with credit are likely to continue to struggle to survive .
in europe , meanwhile , matters are unlikely to be any better .
europe has finally managed to come to the rescue of greece and ireland .
in the run up to the crisis , both were governed by right-@@ wing governments marked by cr@@ ony capitalism or worse , demonstrating once again that free-@@ market economics didn ’ t work in europe any better than it did in the us .
in greece , as in the us , a new government was left to clean up the mess .
the ir@@ ish government that encouraged reck@@ less bank len@@ ding and the creation of a property bubble was , perhaps not surprisingly , no more ade@@ pt in managing the economy after the crisis that it was before .
politics aside , property bubbles leave in their wake a legacy of debt and excess capacity in real estate that is not easily rec@@ ti@@ fied – especially when politically connected banks resist re@@ struc@@ turing mort@@ g@@ ages .
to me , attemp@@ ting to disc@@ ern the economic pro@@ spe@@ cts for 2011 is not a particularly interesting question : the answer is b@@ leak , with little upside potential and a lot of down@@ side risk .
more importantly , how long will it take europe and america to recover , and can asia ’ s seemingly ex@@ port-@@ dependent economies continue to grow if their historical markets langu@@ ish ?
my best bet is that these countries will maintain rapid growth as they shift their economic focus to their vast and un@@ tapped domestic markets .
this will require consider@@ able re@@ struc@@ turing of their economies , but china and india are both dynamic , and proved their resilience in their response to the great recession .
i am not so bu@@ lli@@ sh on europe and america .
in both cases , the underlying problem is in@@ sufficient aggregate demand .
the ultimate irony is that there are simultaneously excess capacity and vast un@@ met needs – and policies that could restore growth by using the former to address the lat@@ ter .
both the us and europe , for instance , must retro@@ fit their economies to address the challenges of global warming .
there are feasi@@ ble policies that would work within long-term budget constraints .
the problem is politics : in the us , the republican party would rather see president barack obama fail than the economy succeed .
in europe , 27 countries with different interests and perspectives are pulling in different directions , without enough solidar@@ ity to compen@@ sa@@ te .
the bail@@ out pack@@ ages are , in this light , impressive achievements .
in both europe and america , the free-@@ market ideology that allowed asset bubbles to grow un@@ fe@@ ttered – markets always know best , so government must not intervene – now ties policymakers ’ hands in designing effective responses to the crisis .
one might have thought that the crisis itself would under@@ mine confidence in that ideology .
instead , it has resur@@ faced to drag governments and economies down the sin@@ k@@ hole of au@@ ster@@ ity .
if politics is the problem in europe and america , only political changes are likely to restore them to growth .
or else they can wait until the over@@ hang of excess capacity dimin@@ ishes , capital goods become obsolete , and the economy ’ s internal restor@@ ative forces work their gradu@@ al magic .
either way , victory is not around the corner .
what mccain and obama ignore
princeton – barack obama worked for three years as a community organi@@ zer on chicago ’ s bli@@ ghted south side , so he knows all about the real poverty that exists in america .
he knows that in one of the world ’ s richest nations , 37 million people live in poverty , a far higher proportion than in europe ’ s wealthy nations .
yet obama ’ s campaigning has focused on “ main street ” and tax cuts for the middle class , by@@ passing the issue of what to do about poverty .
it ’ s not as if obama has no policies for helping the poor .
go to his web site , click on “ the issues ” and then on “ poverty . ”
there you will find a set of thoughtful pro@@ pos@@ als ranging from raising the minimum wage to establi@@ shing model “ promise neighborhoods ” that will attempt to turn around areas with high levels of poverty and low levels of educational achievement by providing services such as early childhood education and crime prevention .
( go to john mccain ’ s web site , and you won ’ t even find “ poverty ” among the list of issues to click on – although “ space program ” is there . )
so why isn ’ t obama speaking up about an issue on which he has so much more first-@@ hand experience than his oppon@@ ent , and better policies , too ?
perhaps not enough of the poor vote , or they will vote democratic anyway .
moreover , his researchers presumably have told him that independent middle-class voters are more likely to be won over by appe@@ als to their wal@@ lets than to concern for america ’ s poor .
if america ’ s poor don ’ t rank high among voters ’ concerns , it is no surprise that the poor abroad are virtually invisible .
again , obama has both the background – with his family ties to kenya – and a promising policy , to increase america ’ s foreign assistance to $ 50 billion by 2012 , using the money to stabilize failing states and bring sustainable growth to africa .
( currently , of all the oecd donor nations , only greece gives a lower percentage of its gross national income than the united states does . )
but when obama ’ s running mate , joe bi@@ den , was asked , in his debate with his republican counter@@ part , sarah palin , what pro@@ pos@@ als an ob@@ ama@@ -@@ bi@@ den administration might have to scale back as a result of the $ 700 billion wall street bail@@ out , the only specific proposal he mentioned was the increase in foreign assistance .
mccain has never gotten down to specifi@@ cs about how much foreign aid he would like the us to give .
both candidates refer to deaths of american military personnel in iraq , but there has been less attention to the war ’ s civilian caus@@ alities .
in her debate with bi@@ den , palin actually attacked obama for saying that , in her words , “ all we ’ re doing in afghanistan is air-@@ ra@@ i@@ ding villages and killing civili@@ ans . ” she called that comment “ reck@@ less ” and “ un@@ true , ” because , “ that ’ s not what we ’ re doing there .
we ’ re fighting terrorists , and we ’ re se@@ cur@@ ing democracy . ”
of course , killing civili@@ ans is not all that the us and its nato allies are doing in afghanistan , and if obama impli@@ ed that it was , his rhetoric was car@@ eless .
but what is extraordinary about palin ’ s comment is that , despite being a strong pro@@ pon@@ ent of the sanc@@ ti@@ ty of human life , in critici@@ zing obama she did not pause to de@@ pl@@ ore the serious loss of innocent human life that american air strikes in afghanistan have caused .
afghanistan ’ s president , ham@@ id kar@@ za@@ i , has repeatedly expressed ou@@ trage at american air strikes that have killed civili@@ ans – most recently in august , when he said that 95 afgh@@ ans , including 50 children , were killed in the bom@@ bing of a village .
the global ethical challenge that has been most promin@@ ent in the campaign is climate change .
here , the candidates ’ goals are virtually identical : they both support a cap@@ -and-@@ trade system to make deep cuts in us green@@ house@@ -@@ gas emissions by 2050 .
obama wants the goal to be an 80 % reduction and mccain says 66 % , but , since the next president will leave office no later than 20@@ 16 , that difference is irrelevant .
interestingly , one ethical issue on which neither candidate has campaig@@ ned has been shown to have the potential to move voters .
a group called defen@@ ders of wildlife has been running an ad graphi@@ cally high@@ lighting palin ’ s support for shooting wol@@ ves from aircraft .
a study of republicans , democrats , and indepen@@ dents showed that viewing the ad led to greater support for obama .
according to glenn k@@ ess@@ ler , the head of h@@ cd research , which conducted the study with the mu@@ hlen@@ berg college institute of public opinion , whereas recent ads from both parties have had little impact among voters , “ this is the first ad in over a month that seems to have broken through . ”
consistent with that finding , an historic bal@@ lot initiative in california to ban cruel forms of animal con@@ fin@@ ement on factory farms , including the battery cage system of keeping hens , is also showing strong support .
what mon@@ etary policy does china need ?
china ’ s remarkable growth has been finan@@ ced recently by a rapid expansion of money and bank credit that is producing an increasingly unsustainable investment boom .
this rene@@ ws concerns that the country may not be able to aver@@ t a re@@ play of the painful boom – and-@@ bust cycle such as the one it en@@ du@@ red in the mid-@@ 1990 ’ s .
mon@@ etary policy is usually the first line of defense in such situations .
but china ’ s mon@@ etary policy has been ham@@ str@@ ung by the tightly managed ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate regime . this regime prevents the central bank – the people ’ s bank of china ( p@@ bc ) – from taking appropriate policy decisions to manage domestic demand , because interest@@ -@@ rate hi@@ kes could encourage capital in@@ flows and put further pressure on the exchange rate .
there is , of course , a vi@@ gor@@ ous ongoing debate about china ’ s ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate policy .
china ’ s rising trade surplus has led some obser@@ vers to call for a re@@ valu@@ ation of the ren@@ min@@ bi to correct what they see as an unfair competitive advantage that china main@@ tains in international markets .
others argue that the stable exchange rate fo@@ sters macro@@ economic stability in china .
but this debate mis@@ ses the point .
what china really needs is a truly independent mon@@ etary policy oriented to domestic obje@@ ctives .
this would enable the p@@ bc to manage domestic demand by allowing interest rates to rise in order to rein in credit growth and deter reck@@ less investment .
an independent mon@@ etary policy requires a flexible exchange rate , not a re@@ valu@@ ation .
but what could take the place of the stable exchange rate as an an@@ chor for mon@@ etary policy and for tying down inflation expectations ?
we recommend a low inflation objective as the an@@ chor for mon@@ etary policy in china .
how could such a framework be operated effectively in an economy in which financial sector problems have weak@@ ened the mon@@ etary transmission mechanism ?
this is a key concern because , not@@ with@@ standing recent reforms , the banking system remains fragile .
nevertheless , we believe that a minimal set of financial sector reforms – essentially making banks ’ balance sheets strong enough to with@@ stand substantial interest@@ -@@ rate policy actions – should suff@@ ice to implement a low inflation objective .
although full moderni@@ zation of the financial sector is a long way off even in the best of circumstances , the minimal reforms that we recommend could streng@@ then the banking system suffici@@ ently in the near term to support a more flexible exchange rate an@@ ch@@ ored by an inflation objective .
indeed , price stability , and the broader macro@@ economic stability eman@@ ating from it , would provide a good foundation for pushing forward with other financial sector reforms .
the framework we suggest has the important benefit of continuity .
the p@@ bc would not have to change its operational approach to mon@@ etary policy .
only a shift in strategic focus would be needed to an@@ chor mon@@ etary policy with a long-@@ run target range for low inflation .
monitoring of mon@@ etary ( and credit ) targets would still be important in achieving the inflation objective .
furthermore , it should be easier to adopt the new framework when times are good – like now , when growth is strong and inflation is low .
there is some risk that appreciation of the exchange rate if greater flexibility were allowed could precipit@@ ate def@@ lation .
what this really high@@ lights , however , is the importance of fra@@ ming the debate about ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate flexibility in a broader context .
having an independent mon@@ etary policy that could counter@@ act boom@@ -and-@@ bust cycles would be the best way for china to deal with such risks .
contrary to those who regard the discussion of an alternative mon@@ etary framework as premature , there are good reasons for china to begin right now to build the institutional foundation for the transition to an independent mon@@ etary policy .
indeed , early adoption of a low inflation objective would help secure the mon@@ etary and financial stability that china needs as it allows greater ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate flexibility .
what money can buy
chicago – in an interesting recent book , what money can ’ t buy : the moral limits of the market , the harvard philosopher michael sandel points to the range of things that money can buy in modern societies and gently tries to sto@@ ke our ou@@ trage at the market ’ s growing dominance .
is he right that we should be al@@ armed ?
while sandel worries about the corrup@@ ting nature of some mon@@ eti@@ zed trans@@ actions ( do kids really develop a love of reading if they are bri@@ bed to read books ? ) , he is also concerned about unequal access to money , which makes tra@@ des using money inherently unequal .
more generally , he fears that the expansion of anonymous mon@@ etary exchange ero@@ des social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on , and argues for reducing money ’ s role in society .
sandel ’ s concerns are not entirely new , but his examples are worth reflecting upon .
in the united states , some companies pay the unemployed to stand in line for free public tickets to con@@ gressi@@ onal hear@@ ings .
they then sell the tickets to lobby@@ ists and corporate lawyers who have a business interest in the hearing but are too busy to stand in line .
clearly , public hear@@ ings are an important element of participatory democracy .
all citizens should have equal access .
so selling access seems to be a per@@ version of democratic principles .
the fundamental problem , though , is scarcity .
we cannot accommo@@ date everyone in the room who might have an interest in a particularly important hearing .
so we have to “ sell ” entry .
we can either allow people to use their time ( standing in line ) to bid for seats , or we can au@@ ction seats for money .
the former seems fair@@ er , because all citizens seemingly start with equal en@@ dow@@ ments of time .
but is a single mother with a high-@@ pressure job and three young children as equally endo@@ wed with spare time as a student on summer vacation ?
and is society better off if she , the chief legal coun@@ sel for a large corporation , spends much of her time standing in line ?
whether it is better to sell entry tickets for time or for money thus depends on what we hope to achieve .
if we want to increase society ’ s productive efficiency , people ’ s willingness to pay with money is a reasonable indic@@ ator of how much they will gain if they have access to the hearing .
au@@ c@@ tioning seats for money makes sense – the lawyer contributes more to society by preparing brie@@ fs than by standing in line .
on the other hand , if it is important that young , impres@@ sion@@ able citizens see how their democracy works , and that we build social solidar@@ ity by making corporate execu@@ tives stand in line with job@@ less teenagers , it makes sense to force people to bid with their time and to make entry tickets non-@@ transfer@@ able .
but if we think that both obje@@ ctives – efficiency and solidar@@ ity – should play some role , perhaps we should turn a blind eye to hir@@ ing the unemployed to stand in line in lie@@ u of busy lawyers , so long as they do not corner all of the seats .
what about the sale of human organs , another example sandel worries about ?
something seems wrong when a lung or a kidney is sold for money .
yet we celebrate the kindness of a stranger who don@@ ates a kidney to a young child .
so , clearly , it is not the transfer of the organ that ou@@ tra@@ ges us – we do not think that the donor is mis@@ informed about the value of a kidney or is being fooled into par@@ ting with it .
nor , i think , do we have concerns about the scru@@ ples of the person selling the organ – after all , they are par@@ ting irrever@@ si@@ bly with something that is dear to them for a price that few of us would accept .
i think part of our dis@@ comfort has to do with the circumstances in which the trans@@ action takes place .
what kind of society do we live in if people have to sell their organs to survive ?
but , while a ban on organ sales may make us feel better , does it really make society better off ?
possibly , if it makes society work harder to ensure that people are never driven to the circumstances that would make them contemp@@ late selling a vital organ .
but possibly not , if it allows society to ignore the underlying problem , either moving the trade underground , or forcing people in such circumstances to resort to worse reme@@ dies .
then again , part of our un@@ ease probably has to do with what we perceive as an unequal exchange .
the seller is giving up part of her body in an irrever@@ sible trans@@ action .
the bu@@ yer is giving up only money – perhaps earned on a lucky stock trade or at an over@@ paid job .
if that money had been earned by selling a portion of a lung , or represented savings pain@@ fully accum@@ ulated during years of back@@ breaking work , we might consider the exchange more equal .
of course , the central virtue of money is precisely its anony@@ mity .
i need know nothing about the dollar bill i receive to be able to use it .
but , because money ’ s anony@@ mity obsc@@ ures its pro@@ ven@@ ance , it may be socially less acceptable as a medium of payment for some objects .
in both examples – con@@ gressi@@ onal tickets and organ sales – sandel suggests reducing money ’ s role .
but money has many virtues in facili@@ tating trans@@ actions – hence its ubiquitous use .
so , perhaps the more important message is that society ’ s tolerance for mon@@ eti@@ zation is proportional to the legiti@@ macy accor@@ ded to the distribution of money .
the more people believe that it is the hard@@ working and the deser@@ ving who have money , the more they are willing to tolerate trans@@ actions for money ( though some trans@@ actions remain beyond the p@@ ale ) .
but if people believe that the mon@@ eyed are primarily those who are well connected or cro@@ o@@ ked , their tolerance for mon@@ etary trans@@ actions falls .
rather than focusing on prohi@@ biting mon@@ etary trans@@ actions , perhaps a more important lesson im@@ par@@ ted by sandel ’ s examples is that we should work continuously to improve the perceived legiti@@ macy of money ’ s distribution .
the moral limits of markets
tokyo – today , there are very few things that money can ’ t buy .
if you are sent@@ enced to a jail term in santa barbara , california , and don ’ t like the standard accommo@@ dations , you can buy a pris@@ on-@@ cell upgrade for about $ 90 per night .
if you want to help to prevent the tragic fact that , each year , thousands of babies are born to dru@@ g-@@ addicted mothers , you can contribute to a charity that uses a market mechanism to am@@ eli@@ or@@ ate the problem : a $ 300 cash grant to any dru@@ g-@@ addicted woman willing to be steri@@ lized .
or , if you want to attend a us con@@ gressi@@ onal hearing , but don ’ t want to wait for hours in line , you can en@@ list the services of a lin@@ e-@@ standing company .
the company hir@@ es homeless people and others in need of work to wait in line – overnight if necessary .
just before the hearing begins , the paying customer can take his or her lin@@ e-@@ stan@@ der ’ s place in the queue , and claim a front-@@ row seat in the hearing room .
is there anything wrong with buying and selling these things ?
some would say no ; people should be free to spend their money to buy whatever someone else is willing to sell .
others believe that there are some things that money should not be able to buy .
but why ? what exactly is wrong with selling pris@@ on-@@ cell up@@ grades to those who can afford them , or offering cash for sterili@@ zation , or hir@@ ing lin@@ e-@@ st@@ anders ?
to answer questions such as these , we need to pose a bigger question : what role should money and markets play in a good society ?
asking this question , and deb@@ ating it politically , is more important than ever .
the last three decades have witnessed a quiet revolution , as markets and market@@ -@@ oriented thinking have reached into spheres of life previously governed by non-@@ market values : family life and personal relations ; health and education ; environmental protection and criminal justice ; national security and civic life .
almost without realizing it , we have dri@@ fted from having market economies to becoming market societies .
the difference is this : a market economy is a tool – a valuable and effective tool – for organizing productive activity .
a market society , by contrast , is a place where almost everything is up for sale .
it is a way of life in which market values se@@ ep into social relations and govern every domain .
we should be worried about this trend for two reasons .
first , as money lo@@ oms larger in our societies , afflu@@ ence – and its absence – matters more .
if the main advantages of afflu@@ ence were the ability to afford y@@ ach@@ ts and fancy vac@@ ations , inequality would matter less than it does today .
but , as money comes to govern access to education , health care , political influence , and safe neighborhoods , life becomes harder for those of modest means .
the marke@@ tization of everything shar@@ p@@ ens the sting of inequality .
a second reason to resist putting a price tag on all human activities is that doing so can be corrup@@ ting .
prostitution is a classic example .
some object to it on the grounds that it typically explo@@ its the poor , for whom the choice to sell their bodies may not be truly voluntary .
but others object on the grounds that reducing sex to a commodity is inherently degra@@ ding and obje@@ c@@ ti@@ fying .
the idea that market relations can corrupt higher goods is not restricted to matters of sex and the body .
it also applies to civic goods and practices .
we don ’ t allow a free market in votes , even though such a market would arguably be “ efficient , ” in the economist ’ s sense of the term .
many people don ’ t use their votes , so why let them go to waste ?
why not let those who don ’ t much care about an election ’ s outcome sell their vote to someone who does ?
both parties to the trans@@ action would be better off .
the best argument against a market in votes is that the vote is not a piece of private property ; rather , it is a public responsibility .
to treat a vote as an instrument of profit would be to degrade it , to corrupt its meaning as an expression of civic duty .
but , if a market in votes is obje@@ c@@ tion@@ able because it corrup@@ ts democracy , what about systems of campaign finance ( including the one currently in place in the united states ) that give wealthy donors a dis@@ proportion@@ ate voice in elections ?
the reason to reject a market in votes – preserving the integrity of democracy – may be a reason to limit financial contributions to political candidates as well .
of course , we often disagree about what counts as “ corrup@@ ting ” or “ degra@@ ding . ”
to decide whether prostitution is degra@@ ding , we have to decide how human sexuality is properly valued .
to decide whether selling pris@@ on-@@ cell up@@ grades corrup@@ ts the meaning of criminal justice , we have to decide what purpose criminal punishment should serve .
to decide whether we should allow the buying and selling of human organs for transplantation , or hire mer@@ cen@@ aries to fight our wars , we have to think through hard questions about human dignity and civic responsibility .
these are controversial questions , and we often try to avoid addressing them in public dis@@ course .
but that is a mistake .
our rel@@ uc@@ tance to engage morally con@@ tested questions in politics has left us ill-@@ equipped to deliber@@ ate about one of the most important issues of our time : where do markets serve the public good , and where do they not belong ?
what next after the gaza with@@ dra@@ wal ?
the with@@ dra@@ wal of israeli troops and the ev@@ acu@@ ation of jewish sett@@ lers from gaza , after 38 years of occupation , is the most recent proof of the limits of military power , even when that power is overwhelming .
now is the time to take stock of the lessons learned from the years of occupation and resistance in order to understand what israelis and palestini@@ ans should do next .
to begin with , it is imperative to understand how much credit palestini@@ ans can credi@@ bly claim for the israeli with@@ dra@@ wal .
true , palestinian resistance and sacrifi@@ ces were a contributing factor in ar@@ iel shar@@ on ’ s decision to reverse a policy he had es@@ po@@ used for decades .
but it would be a mistake to attribute the israeli with@@ dra@@ wal exclu@@ sively to palestinian mili@@ tancy .
after all , this bitter@@ sweet israeli action was neither a clear result of military defeat nor a consequence of political negotiations .
but un@@ il@@ ater@@ alism is not a rational long-term and effective policy , for it will not lead to a genuine and lasting peace in the middle east .
just as president bush has discovered in iraq , shar@@ on will also be forced to acknowledge the limits of his strategy .
un@@ il@@ ater@@ alism seems very expe@@ dient to short@@ sighted politicians , for it obvi@@ ates the need for what they perceive as the mess of actual negotiations – that is , meeting their counter@@ parts face to face and discovering the human results of their policies .
going it alone also seems politically advanta@@ geous domest@@ ically , because leaders can decide how much and how far they want to carry out a particular policy .
to be fair , un@@ il@@ ater@@ alism is convenient not only for a reluctant israeli prime minister who does not wish to make substantial com@@ promises during negotiations ; it is also attractive to hard-@@ line palestini@@ ans who regard multi@@ lat@@ er@@ alism as a means of pressing them to make un@@ popular conc@@ essions .
in any case , the day after the comple@@ tion of the gaza with@@ dra@@ wal , israelis and palestini@@ ans will be confronted with important un@@ resolved questions .
there is no doubt that the ev@@ acu@@ ation of jewish sett@@ lers in areas that israelis consider part of their go@@ d-@@ given territory represents a huge ideological rever@@ sal .
but after years of pre@@ aching and practicing one of zi@@ on@@ ism ’ s main ten@@ ets , will the re@@ mov@@ al of sett@@ lements continue in the west bank , or will this be a one-@@ time exception ?
palestini@@ ans , for their part , will be expected to answer questions – in dee@@ ds , not just in words – about their ability to build a modern plur@@ alistic state .
how will the palestinian body poli@@ tic deal with the growing power of the islamic movements that und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly will expect a significant share of power in post-@@ with@@ dra@@ wal gaza ?
the international community also will have to answer some key questions . according to the palestinian economic council for reconstruction and development ( pe@@ c@@ dar ) , annual per capita income in gaza continues to average roughly $ 700 , while israelis enjoy incomes aver@@ aging a $ 16@@ ,000 per capita .
in the absence of relatively well-@@ paying jobs , what will happen to the lines of unemployed ga@@ z@@ ans ? the potential flight of employment see@@ kers – a for@@ mid@@ able force worldwide – is only one problem .
more immediately , if ga@@ z@@ an families are not well fed , the recur@@ r@@ ence of cross-@@ border violence , if not the erup@@ tion of a third inti@@ fa@@ da , will only be a matter of time .
while the economic situation in gaza is a critical issue , the future of the palestini@@ an-@@ israeli conflict will be determined mainly by the next steps in the peace process .
perman@@ ent-@@ status issues concern@@ ing borders , the west bank , jerusalem , and refugees must be dealt with bil@@ ater@@ ally .
any serious observer of the palestini@@ an-@@ israeli conflict will no doubt acknowledge that there can be no un@@ il@@ ateral solution to these issues .
as for the peace process ’ s multi@@ lat@@ eral guar@@ ant@@ ors , the united states and its quar@@ tet partners – the european union , the united nations , and russia – have failed to provide even the most basic facts regar@@ ding israel ’ s with@@ dra@@ wal or how it relates to the “ road map ” agreed in 2003 .
they cannot continue to sit on the si@@ del@@ ines . washington ’ s qui@@ x@@ otic decision to call israel ’ s un@@ il@@ ateral move part of the road map has failed to convince many palestini@@ ans .
the prevail@@ ing opinion among palestini@@ ans is that the road map will be put into deep freeze once the israelis complete their gaza with@@ dra@@ wal .
but the palestinian and israeli peoples , their leaders , and the international community must all respond to the challenges that will follow .
most importantly , the future of the conflict and the chances for genuine peace in the region will depend on understanding the limits of offensive military power , defen@@ sive resistance , and un@@ il@@ ater@@ alism .
serious face-@@ to-@@ face talks , in accor@@ dance to international law and with the help of the international community , are the only way forward .
what next after the li@@ ku@@ d refer@@ end@@ um ?
prime minister ar@@ iel shar@@ on &apos;s proposal for a un@@ il@@ ateral israeli with@@ dra@@ wal from the gaza strip and part of the west bank has been overwhel@@ m@@ ingly defeated by a refer@@ end@@ um within his own party , li@@ ku@@ d , in what seems to be a humili@@ ating defeat .
yet this is likely to have little or no effect on shar@@ on &apos;s intention to carry through with the plan .
at first , this seems surprising , since he said before the refer@@ end@@ um that he would ab@@ ide by its outcome .
but shar@@ on is 75 years old and probably within two years of retirement .
he is determined that his plan becomes his political legacy .
since there is no prece@@ dent for a party refer@@ end@@ um , he can argue that the vote does not bind him .
moreover , shar@@ on made sure that his main political ri@@ vals - not@@ ably former prime minister benjamin ( bi@@ bi ) net@@ any@@ ah@@ u - supported his plan .
they are now in no position to challenge him as the champi@@ ons of the opposition within li@@ ku@@ d .
so while some members may walk out , shar@@ on can easily hold on to control of the party .
in addition , many shar@@ on suppor@@ ters , torn by what they saw as the plan &apos;s combination of costs and benefits , stayed home or even voted against it , but still want shar@@ on as their leader .
but shar@@ on is prepared to go even further in taking political risks to push through the with@@ dra@@ wal .
small right-@@ wing parties in his coalition have already announced that his determination to do so will make them walk out of the government .
shar@@ on will then turn to the leader of the opposition , 80-@@ year-old former prime minister shi@@ mon per@@ es , to form a national unity government .
and per@@ es is ready to do so .
the passionate debate stir@@ red up by shar@@ on &apos;s plan shows how truly revolutionary his proposal is .
having the army u@@ pro@@ ot jewish sett@@ lements - with inevitable scenes of sett@@ lers resi@@ sting and being dragged off - will be a traumatic event for the country .
the plan also ent@@ a@@ ils consider@@ able strategic risks , which , probably more than the prospect of u@@ pro@@ oted sett@@ lements , account for the large &quot; no &quot; by li@@ ku@@ d members .
a key concern is the prece@@ dent of with@@ dra@@ wal from southern lebanon in 2000 .
today , most israelis believe that this step , though justi@@ fied on strategic grounds in the face of constant attacks by the le@@ ban@@ ese group hi@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h , convinced palestini@@ ans that violence worked .
in the same manner , a with@@ dra@@ wal from gaza , many people worry , will bring increased an@@ archy there and a rise in overall terrorist attacks .
but convinced - as are most israelis - that there is no palestinian partner ready to negotiate seriously and implement its promises , the prime minister wants to prepare for an extended inter@@ im period .
assuming that terrorist attacks against israel are going to continue under any circumstances , he see@@ ks to improve the country &apos;s strategic position to handle this war .
combined with the long-@@ completed security fence around the gaza strip and one being built near israel &apos;s border with the west bank , pulling out of the most exposed positions is intended to reduce casu@@ alties and the number of clas@@ hes with the palestini@@ ans .
a secondary intention is to show the world that israel is ready to with@@ draw from most of the remaining terri@@ tories it captured in 1967 in exchange for real peace .
the united states and britain have supported the with@@ dra@@ wal plan , while most other european countries have been critical .
while demanding an israeli with@@ dra@@ wal for years , the palestinian leadership op@@ poses shar@@ on &apos;s plan , arguing it is intended to create permanent borders .
nevertheless , if implemented , shar@@ on &apos;s proposal would leave them in control of about 99 percent of the gaza strip and roughly 50 percent of the west bank .
if it appears that the with@@ dra@@ wal will proceed and shar@@ on can assemble a government to implement it , the palestinian side will then face a major challenge .
will it be able to put together an effective governmental authority to rule the gaza strip , or will that area dis@@ solve into bloody bat@@ tles among palestinian fac@@ tions and a st@@ aging area for attacks into israel that will bring re@@ pris@@ al ra@@ ids ?
a key issue in this mix is the division of power between the nation@@ alist fat@@ ah group and the islam@@ ist hamas organization .
local fat@@ ah officials want support from their leader , y@@ as@@ sir ar@@ af@@ at , to take firm control of the territory .
but ar@@ af@@ at has shown a willingness to let groups act as they please , apparently believing that continuing un@@ rest will bring international sympathy and intervention on his behalf .
yet ar@@ af@@ at himself will be 75 in a few months and is clearly reaching the end of his career .
he has been the only leader his movement has ever known , having led fat@@ ah for 40 years and the palestini@@ ans as a whole for 35 years .
with no apparent success@@ or , his de@@ par@@ ture from the scene will bring a massive and unpredictable sha@@ ke@@ -up in palestinian politics .
the israeli government &apos;s projection has been that both the with@@ dra@@ wal and the security fence will be completed by the end of 2005 .
shar@@ on &apos;s retirement is likely to come within another twel@@ ve months , with a new opposition leader having to be chosen as well .
thus , while the li@@ ku@@ d refer@@ end@@ um seems to have left the israeli@@ -@@ palestinian dispute at yet another im@@ pas@@ se , both sides are on the verge of enormous changes .
what next for europe ?
in many ways , 2005 has been europe ’ s annu@@ s hori@@ bili@@ s .
it began well , when spanish voters approved the dra@@ ft european union constitution , but it turned s@@ our when french and dutch voters spur@@ ned it soon after .
those votes partly reflected dis@@ pleasure with domestic policies , and partly disap@@ pointment with the way governments conduct european affairs .
governments promp@@ tly obli@@ ged with more of the same .
within days of the votes , they failed to agree on the eu budget for 200@@ 7-@@ 13 .
french and british leaders engaged in a heated quar@@ rel that der@@ a@@ iled the subsequ@@ ent summit , before britain assumed the rotating six-@@ month eu pres@@ iden@@ cy in july .
normally , countries use their eu pres@@ iden@@ cies to display their ability to solve problems and move the union forward .
but , as of early december , britain has remained dor@@ m@@ ant .
besides bur@@ ying the dra@@ ft constitution , it has largely side@@ stepped the budget issue .
chances that it gets the budget approved this year are slim , and , unless the dispute is resolved soon , the union will not have an operational budget by 2007 .
even if a budget is adopted , there is no lack of depressing business for the austri@@ an pres@@ iden@@ cy , which starts on january 1 .
the deepest problem is europe ’ s inability to grow at more than a sna@@ il ’ s pace and to provide jobs to its citizens .
this is mostly due to the big three – france , germany , and italy – which produce 70 % of europe ’ s gdp .
the collective response , adopted in 2000 , has been the “ li@@ s@@ bon strategy , ” which aims at making the eu “ the most dynamic and competitive knowled@@ ge-@@ based economy in the world ” by 2010 .
more reali@@ stically , it is designed to provide governments with the incentive to under@@ take the reforms that stimulate economic growth and productivity .
that means facing down the myri@@ ad interest groups – from industry lob@@ bies to trade uni@@ ons and ent@@ ren@@ ched bureau@@ cra@@ cies – that have ( so far ) successfully protected their tur@@ fs .
the strategy re@@ sts on peer pressure , nam@@ ing and sh@@ aming governments that fail to make progress .
in practice , however , peer pressure has become peer coll@@ usion .
when eu leaders met last spring to ass@@ ess progress , they pi@@ ti@@ fully recognized that the li@@ s@@ bon strategy ’ s goal was unlikely to be met .
the best that they could do now would be to dump the preten@@ se of a strategy and carry on with the other business .
unfortunately , the host of the 2000 summit was jo@@ s@@ é manuel bar@@ ro@@ so , then prime minister of portugal and current president of the european commission , who has sta@@ ked his pres@@ iden@@ cy on the li@@ s@@ bon strategy .
one of the few good ideas contained in the li@@ s@@ bon strategy was to remove barriers to trade in services .
intra@@ -@@ european competition in services is restricted by in@@ numer@@ able national regulations that , for instance , strictly determine the requirements for becoming a hair@@ d@@ res@@ ser or a plum@@ ber .
one of the defining features of the past decades is the sharp increase in services productivity in the us ; none of that happened in europe .
guess why .
because services account for 70 % of european gdp , the potential impact from enhanced competition is substantial .
but removing protection is always politically difficult .
the european commission submitted a proposal in 2005 – just as the constitution was being put up for a vote .
not surprisingly , the proposal was quickly shel@@ ved .
now , with countless private interest groups trying to water it down into ir@@ relevance , the battle will be firmly on the eu ’ s agenda in 2006 .
at the same time , europe is again blocking progress in the doha round of world trade talks , with the farmers ’ lobby fighting to preserve its subsidies .
many governments are so fear@@ ful of their farmers that they see no other option than to hold their ground , no matter what .
europe has agreed to a single trade policy .
when dis@@ agre@@ ements run as deep as they do on agriculture , there can be no gi@@ ve-@@ and-@@ take of the kind that allows for successful negotiations .
there is little reason for optimism .
and what next for the ec@@ b , which has just nu@@ dged up interest rates by 0.@@ 25 % , after 30 months on hold .
experts can disagree about whether the move was premature , but no one agrees with the many political leaders who have argued that the tiny hi@@ ke will der@@ a@@ il the ti@@ mi@@ d res@@ um@@ ption of economic growth .
the shar@@ p@@ ness of political attacks on the ec@@ b might trigger dangerous talk about restri@@ cting its independence .
while such a move is out of the question – it would require a change in the european treaty – the noise is unhealthy .
it distra@@ cts the ec@@ b , adds to the impression that europe is bad , and , more importantly , will be used by in@@ effective governments as a sc@@ ape@@ goat for their fail@@ ings .
is europe stuck ?
the current team of leaders has been an enormous disap@@ pointment .
but as they fade away , there could be some light at the end of the tunnel .
in germany , chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a mer@@ kel is obviously more positive on europe and more pro-@@ reform than her pre@@ de@@ cess@@ or , but she is tied up in a grand coalition .
in france , president jacques chi@@ ra@@ c , the epit@@ ome of a leader captured by his lob@@ bies , is staggering im@@ po@@ tently toward the end of his term in 2007 .
the two fron@@ trun@@ ners to succeed him , domini@@ que de vil@@ lep@@ in and ni@@ col@@ as sar@@ ko@@ zy , both in government , compete on a re@@ form@@ ist agenda , but pre-@@ election years do not encourage bold moves .
meanwhile , italy must decide whether it re@@ places prime minister sil@@ vi@@ o ber@@ lus@@ con@@ i , who displayed no interest in reform and european affairs , with the cau@@ tious roman@@ o pro@@ di , the former european commission president .
tony blair , once an ar@@ dent pro-@@ european ( at least by britain ’ s un@@ demanding standards ) , might finally have to ce@@ de power to gordon brown , who is famously cold to european integration .
fortunately , britain has always been an outsi@@ der .
in the end , whatever light there is , it may not shine until 2007 , after the french elections .
what next in afghanistan ?
berlin – afghanistan ’ s future does not look good .
the taliban are gaining military and political strength , and president ham@@ id kar@@ za@@ i is losing support at home and internation@@ ally due to his administration ’ s ramp@@ ant corruption and the obvious frau@@ d committed in his re-@@ election .
the west seems to have lost its orientation in the hindu kus@@ h – that “ gra@@ ve@@ yard of empires , ” as it was called after the british disaster in january 18@@ 42 , when only one man survived an expedition 16@@ ,000 .
europe remains silent on that question and has only one aim : to get out .
follow it , and you will conclude that , ultimately , the war is all about the american superpower ’ s military victory over the taliban , so that it can finally with@@ draw its troops – for a second time .
afghanistan is the battle@@ field , but the causes of the wars that have devastated it since the mid-@@ 1970 ’ s were and are still to be found beyond its borders .
so an exclu@@ sively “ afghan solution ” is not possible .
three dates are central to understanding today ’ s afghan qu@@ ag@@ mi@@ re : 1989 , 2001 , and 2003 .
in 1989 , when the cold war ended , the red army had already with@@ drawn from the country , thereby admit@@ ting its defeat .
following the soviet union , the us with@@ drew from the conflict , too , and at that moment , the second afghan war started – a pro@@ xy war between regional neighbors over power in the hindu kus@@ h , disgu@@ ised as a civil war .
supported by saudi arabia , pakistan sought strategic depth against its arch@@ -@@ enemy india with the help of milit@@ ant religious students from afghan refugee camps . these “ taliban ” were created and equipped by the pakistani secret service , the is@@ i .
iran defen@@ ded its own interests and those of the shi@@ a minority in the west of the country .
and in the north , the ta@@ j@@ ik northern alliance and ab@@ dul ras@@ hid do@@ st@@ um ’ s u@@ z@@ be@@ k mili@@ tia were supported and equipped by afghanistan ’ s northern neighbors and russia .
in the shadow of this second afghan war , osama bin laden established his terrorist organization in tali@@ ban@@ -@@ ruled afghanistan : al qaeda , which , on september 11 , 2001 , carried out its terrible terrorist attack on the us .
a month later , the current war in afghanistan started .
in march 2003 , george w. bush launched his invasion of iraq , not only squ@@ ander@@ ing america ’ s military strength , but also connecting all the individual crises between the eastern mediterranean and the indus valley .
as a result of america ’ s foreig@@ n-@@ policy fol@@ ly , iran became the central geo-@@ political player in the entire region , linking the western and eastern part of this long belt of inst@@ ability .
so , those who are gra@@ p@@ pling with the afghan ri@@ ddle today should consider , first and foremost , the regional realities : can the west afford to with@@ draw ?
if so , we should pull out of afghanistan immediately .
if not , we should stop discussing an “ exit strategy . ”
this means that we cannot talk about with@@ drawing our troops , but only of re@@ drawing the battle line farther west .
it is extremely doub@@ t@@ ful that such a step would bring more security .
on the other hand , the west ’ s strategy in afghanistan up to now has also yiel@@ ded little progress , only streng@@ th@@ ening the taliban day by day .
so what should we do ?
first , we need to define a clear political goal : a stable status quo in afghanistan that will prevent the country from again becoming a battle@@ field of regional interests and an organi@@ zational base for al qaeda .
without a sufficient military presence , as well as improved and rein@@ forced reconstruction efforts , this goal is not at@@ tain@@ able .
( the k@@ ash@@ mir conflict must , indi@@ rectly , play a role in this settlement , but the difficulties of including it should not be under@@ estimated . )
for@@ ging this consensus will not be an easy diplo@@ matic task .
but it is feasi@@ ble and should be the goal of a new conference on afghanistan .
it ’ s an equation with very many known un@@ know@@ ns , but if we do not try at least to mi@@ ti@@ gate these issues , the known un@@ know@@ ns will continue challenging all partial solutions .
but the big question remains whether the us and its european allies still have the strength , per@@ sever@@ ance and far-@@ si@@ gh@@ tedness for such an under@@ taking .
there are good reasons to doubt this .
the alternative would be a chaotic and dangerous future in this large hot spot .
what now ?
more europe !
the reje@@ ction of the european union ’ s constitution by french and dutch voters forces us to think well beyond that treaty .
that much is clear from the current debate on the community budget .
the na@@ y@@ sa@@ yers ’ vic@@ tories show that sovereig@@ n@@ ty-@@ based arguments that op@@ pose any kind of european political union are on the march .
euro@@ skep@@ tics , it seems , are gaining ground everywhere , and a kind of xen@@ opho@@ bia is on the rise .
but xen@@ opho@@ bia and sovereig@@ n@@ ty were not the primary impulses that propelled the “ no ” votes .
above all , the “ no ” votes in france and holland – and rising dis@@ content in other member states , such as germany – are the result of the inability of national governments and the union to respond effectively to the problems that most concern citizens .
not only anti-@@ europeans rejected the constitution ; far from it .
many europeans are , in fact , calling on the eu to act to reduce unemployment and to intervene decisi@@ vely in the international arena .
many interpreted europe ’ s internal division over the war in iraq , with ordinary citizens overwhel@@ m@@ ingly opposed to military intervention , as a sign of the union ’ s weakness .
but the answer to such doubt and dis@@ may is more europe , not less .
the european council ’ s summit on june 16-@@ 17 should give a clear sign that it recognizes this .
most suppor@@ ters of the constitution believe that it will not only help build a citizens ’ europe , but also create better conditions for european economic development , and for the eu to act globally .
they are right .
it would be imp@@ ru@@ dent to assume that the french and dutch “ no ” votes were not about dis@@ content with union policies ; but that anger was directed against the french and dutch governments , not europe itself .
the fact is that citizens in every eu member country are increasingly aware that national policies are determined by decision making at the european level , over which they have little influence .
the european constitution has little to do with this , but refer@@ en@@ da are never confined to the actual questions put to voters .
instead , they provide opportunities for citizens to express what they feel about the choices their governments make , particularly within the eu framework .
the 2004 elections for the european parliament had already shown that the level of dis@@ content with the union was high .
voters heavily pun@@ ished almost all national governments .
yet nobody thought that that election had changed the course of europe .
above all , the french and dutch refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms confir@@ med that politics in the union is now conducted “ on the street , ” and that it is no longer possible to “ construct ” europe at a distance and by ste@@ al@@ th .
this means that eu governments must respond to popular anx@@ ie@@ ties and make the union more transparent and democratic .
this would be a lot easier with the constitution in place , but there are measures that can and should be adopted now to make that possible .
first , the community budget should be structured so that it has a significant impact on growth and employment ( a return to the volun@@ tar@@ ism of the del@@ ors pack@@ ages , now applied to the li@@ s@@ bon strategy ) .
second , european governments must show a real commitment to act together .
a key opportunity presents itself with the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the barcelona declar@@ ation to define a common position to support democratic change in the mediterranean by ce@@ asing to back the political status quo there .
finally , council meetings should be open when leg@@ isla@@ tive matters are at stake , so that citizens can know who voted for what and according to which criteria .
all of this can be decided at the next european council , even before the constitu@@ tional problem is resolved .
this kind of action is more likely to win back a skeptical citizen@@ ry than any information campaign , however well designed .
at the same time , it is necessary to solve the constitu@@ tional dead@@ lock .
as already proposed by the convention , this would mean separating constitu@@ tional matters per se from union policy .
the real innovations are found in part i and ii of the proposed constitution , in the definition of the nor@@ ma@@ tive and political identity of the union , its compe@@ ten@@ ces , the new institutional balance – including the creation of a european minister of foreign affairs – and , last but not least , the introduction of a bill of rights .
the part that was actually rejected and raises the most concerns among citizens of the member states is in part i@@ ii , which focuses on union policies such as the common market , competition policy and the common agricultural policy .
so the first and second parts could be rati@@ fied without new negotiations and could form the basis for the new treaty , so that the treaty of nice would still apply ; and the debate on the european social model would continue .
it is essential to re@@ affir@@ m the nor@@ ma@@ tive essence of the constitu@@ tional treaty to protect the greatest achievement of the constitu@@ tional convention .
diversity and inclu@@ si@@ veness , through the integration of european democracies with a common project , remains europe ’ s great gift to the world .
it is what has made europe an “ international public good ” to use former brazilian foreign minister cel@@ so la@@ fer ’ s fe@@ lic@@ it@@ ous turn of phrase .
such a europe is better placed to contribute to a fair@@ er international order than the narrow , bitter europe the xen@@ opho@@ bes have in mind .
for europe to remain a promise for the world , it must thrive as a public good for all its citizens .
europe and europeans cannot wait for a new treaty to show that the union is able to fulfill that promise .
tokyo – the american economist her@@ bert stein once said that if something cannot continue forever , it will not . in the case of im@@ balances between china and the west , however , the cu@@ t-@@ off point still looks to be a long time in the future .
five years ago , many people war@@ ned that excess spending in the west and under@@ valued exchange rates in asia were producing unsustainable im@@ balances .
from 2005 to 2008 , china ’ s bil@@ ateral surplus with the united states increased by 41 % , and its trade surplus with europe more than doubled .
after falling in 2009 , china ’ s surplus with the us and europe increased by 32 % and 16 % , respe@@ ctively , in 2010 .
someone who fell asleep in august 2008 and woke up in 2010 would probably never guess that there had been any inter@@ ruption whatsoever in china ’ s bur@@ ge@@ oning im@@ balances with the west .
these sur@@ pl@@ uses are generated primarily within east asian production networks .
multinational corporations in japan , south korea , and elsewhere ship sophisticated parts and components to china for assembly and re-@@ export to developed countries .
the china cust@@ oms agency classi@@ fies this type of trade as “ processing ” trade .
in 2010 , china ran defic@@ its of more than $ 100 billion in processing trade with east asia and sur@@ pl@@ uses of $ 100 billion with europe and $ 150 billion each with the us and hong kong .
its global surplus in processing trade in 2010 tot@@ aled $ 3@@ 22 billion .
while re@@ balancing is not taking place in processing trade , it is occurring in “ ordinary “ trade ( china ’ s other major cust@@ oms regime ) .
ordinary exports are produced using chinese factors of production , and ordinary impor@@ ts are intended for china ’ s internal market .
china ’ s balance in ordinary trade shifted from a surplus of $ 38 billion in 2005 to a deficit of $ 48 billion in 2010 .
researchers at the cent@@ re d ’ é@@ tudes pro@@ spec@@ tives et d ’ information internation@@ ales , analyzing china ’ s ordinary trade using data up to 2007 ( htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ce@@ pi@@ i.@@ f@@ r / ang@@ la@@ is@@ graph / work@@ pa@@ p / summar@@ ies / 2011 / w@@ p@@ 20@@ 1@@ 1-@@ 0@@ 3.@@ ht@@ m ) , found that europe ( especially germany ) expor@@ ted large volumes of automobiles and other consumer goods to china .
moreover , east asian countries expor@@ ted increasing quantities of parts and components and capital goods to foreig@@ n-@@ owned enter@@ pris@@ es in china that produce for the local market .
by contrast , the share of ordinary us exports to china shr@@ ank , suggesting that china ’ s re@@ balancing is likely to be associated with continued large bil@@ ateral sur@@ pl@@ uses with the us .
subsequ@@ ent data indicate that this pattern is continuing .
in 2010 , china ’ s ordin@@ ar@@ y-@@ trade balance recorded a $ 71 billion deficit with east asia and sur@@ pl@@ uses of $ 44 billion and $ 23 billion with the us and europe , respe@@ ctively .
europe ’ s ordinary exports to china increased from $ 85 billion in 2009 to $ 1@@ 15 billion in 2010 .
by contrast , america ’ s ordinary exports to china increased more slowly , from $ 50 billion in 2009 to $ 64 billion in 2010 .
thus , firms in east asia and europe are benef@@ iting more than firms in the us from increasing demand in china .
according to china cust@@ oms statistics , america ’ s combined bil@@ ateral deficit in processing and ordinary trade in 2010 tot@@ aled $ 18@@ 6 billion .
but this under@@ states the size of the deficit , because the lion ’ s share of china ’ s processed exports to hong kong are trans@@ -@@ shipped to advanced economies ( which means that europe ’ s bil@@ ateral deficit is significantly higher as well ) .
by contrast , us data treat goods coming from china via hong kong as being expor@@ ted from china , yiel@@ ding a bil@@ ateral trade-@@ deficit figure of $ 2@@ 73 billion , up from $ 20@@ 3 billion in 2005 .
many researchers war@@ ned in 2005 that im@@ balances between the us and east asia were unsustainable , not@@ ing that they were driven by excess spending in the us and under@@ valued exchange rates in east asia .
excess spending was fu@@ eled by de@@ terior@@ ation in the us fiscal balance , from a surplus of 2 % of gdp in 2000 to a deficit of 4 % of gdp in 2004 .
under@@ valued exchange rates in asia were supported by accum@@ ulated reserves of almost $ 1 trillion in china , plus hundreds of billions of dollars elsewhere in the region .
since 2005 , us budget defic@@ its have increased by another 6 % of gdp , while china ’ s external reserves have increased by $ 2 trillion .
it is likely that at some point investors will be un@@ willing to continue len@@ ding to the us at low interest rates , and that china will regard continued reserve accumulation as a bad investment .
at that point , the us trade deficit will shrink .
if im@@ balances between the us and china are thus unsustainable , it makes sense for policymakers to pursue a soft landing .
in the case of the us , this requires recognizing that the government faces a budget constra@@ int .
for china , it means re@@ direc@@ ting saving away from reserve accumulation towards c@@ ash@@ -@@ stra@@ pped small and medi@@ um-@@ size enter@@ pris@@ es , as well as mu@@ ch-@@ needed investments in education , health care , and affordable housing .
what res@@ et button ?
moscow – the emergence of a kre@@ m@@ lin leader , president d@@ mit@@ ri med@@ ve@@ de@@ v , without a k@@ gb background , combined with the economic crisis , has inspired talk that when barack obama vis@@ its moscow , america ’ s president will be seeing a country on the verge of a new political tha@@ w , a revi@@ ved per@@ estro@@ i@@ ka .
but pushing the “ re-@@ set button ” on us-@@ russia relations may be harder than obama and his team imagined .
russian ( or soviet ) leaders op@@ t for per@@ estro@@ i@@ ka or a tha@@ w only when forced to do so by di@@ re conditions that threaten the regime ’ s survival .
an atmosphere of mortal fear , mutual suspi@@ cion , and hatred among the communist elite was the cataly@@ st for ni@@ kit@@ a k@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ che@@ v ’ s post-@@ stalin tha@@ w .
for mik@@ ha@@ il gor@@ bach@@ e@@ v in the 1980 ’ s , the cataly@@ st for his per@@ estro@@ i@@ ka was the uss@@ r ’ s growing economic paralysis .
changing the system and e@@ asing their grip on power was a risky move that could under@@ mine their authority .
but the risks of iner@@ tia seemed to be even higher .
in the end , having op@@ ted for change , both were forced to leave their posts pre@@ ma@@ tur@@ ely , against their will .
as he revi@@ ved centralized kre@@ m@@ lin control over russian politics and public affairs , v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin has been concerned primarily with mini@@ mi@@ zing challenges to state power , which he concentrated in his own hands .
to this end , he stripped the political system of competition , ema@@ sc@@ ulated state institutions , margin@@ alized the opposition , and basically eliminated public participation .
his power-@@ building project was facili@@ tated by high oil prices , but came at the cost of a steady de@@ terior@@ ation in the quality of governance and aband@@ on@@ ment of the goal of moderni@@ zation .
with policy@@ making fully non@@ transparent and reduced to a very closed circle , and imple@@ mentation dele@@ gated to an un@@ accountable bureaucracy , the inevitable result of pu@@ tin ’ s political model was pervasive corruption .
the desire to avoid public dis@@ content and ensure social stability led to a suspension of reform .
instead of creating incentives that would unle@@ ash public energi@@ es , the government pushed citizens farther and farther from politics and policy@@ making , thereby dee@@ pen@@ ing social a@@ pathy and atom@@ ization .
moreover , the opportunity provided by the oil boom was wasted .
indeed , today russia risks la@@ gging even further behind the developed countries .
its economy remains un@@ diversi@@ fied and un@@ competitive , and its contribution to global technological progress is min@@ us@@ cule .
worse still , economic growth based on exports of natural resources has proved unsustainable .
when oil prices were high and growing , the government could compen@@ sa@@ te for poor performance by throwing money at problems .
today , with oil prices dramatically reduced , this lar@@ ges@@ se is no longer available , and economic experts agree that the growth potential of russia ’ s petro@@ -@@ economy has been exhausted .
despite all this , the situation is not suffici@@ ently di@@ re to push russia ’ s leaders to open at least some channels of genuine public participation and yield any of their power .
the price of oil , at around $ 70 a barrel , may be half of what it was a year ago , but up from around $ 40 earlier this year .
nor does the russian economy ’ s contra@@ ction and the expected dee@@ pen@@ ing of poverty ( the world bank ’ s report released in late june was gri@@ mmer about russia than its previous report ) pres@@ age an immediate catastrophe .
and , unlike in the late 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s , russia is not inde@@ b@@ ted to foreign banks or international organizations , though it plans to res@@ u@@ me foreign borrowing next year .
so the government will prefer to mu@@ ddle through the crisis , rather than risk any decisi@@ ve reform .
the goal of cl@@ inging to power remains the priority , and ris@@ k-@@ aversion the main guidel@@ ine .
the rul@@ ing elite are known to be torn by dispu@@ tes and ri@@ val@@ ries .
just recently , two of pu@@ tin ’ s de@@ pu@@ ties gave interviews to two western media out@@ lets offering what sounded like star@@ k@@ ly opposite visions for russia ’ s development .
but such dispu@@ tes never spill over into the broad public sphere ; members of the elite are primarily concerned about social and political stability and would not sti@@ r the public by seeking support for an alternative policy course .
these del@@ a@@ ying tactics are enabled by a lack of pressure from below .
russians may be concerned by growing unemployment and reduced incomes , but this is not manifest@@ ing itself in any drive to organize or try to effect political change .
the public below , just like the leaders above , cher@@ ish political stability ; the popul@@ arity ratings of both prime minister pu@@ tin and president d@@ mit@@ ri med@@ ve@@ de@@ v remain above 70 % .
dis@@ grun@@ t@@ lement over the increasingly authoritarian governance may be common among business circles , elements of the neu@@ tered political opposition , liberal intellec@@ tu@@ als , and even part of the bureaucracy .
but these forces are too ti@@ mi@@ d and fragmented , with no drive for political action .
the current government ’ s tac@@ tic of mu@@ ddling through without changing the political system or the structure of the economy is frau@@ ght with the risk of gradu@@ al decline .
to the kre@@ m@@ lin ’ s rul@@ ers , this may seem an acceptable cost for re@@ taining power , but post@@ po@@ ning reform will only ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ate russia ’ s countless problems .
besides , mu@@ ddling through may prove un@@ affordable even in the short run , if oil prices decline again .
a dramatic cur@@ tail@@ ment of state resources may eventually push the government toward moderni@@ zation , but it might also produce an ug@@ lier shift — toward harder political cra@@ ck@@ down , economic nation@@ alism and an essentially isol@@ ation@@ ist course .
this would be catastrophic for russia — to say nothing of relations with the us .
what ’ s happening to the us economy ?
cambridge – the american economy has recently slowed dramatically , and the probability of another economic down@@ turn increases with each new round of data .
this is a sharp change from the economic situation at the end of last year – and represents a return to the very weak pace of expansion since the recovery began in the summer of 2009 .
economic growth in the united states during the first three quarters of 2010 was not only slow , but was also dominated by invent@@ ory accumulation rather than sales to consumers or other forms of final sales .
the last quarter of 2010 brought a welcome change , with consumer spending rising at a 4 % annual rate , enough to increase total real gdp by 3.@@ 1 % from the third quarter to the fourth .
the economy seemed to have escaped its dependence on invent@@ ory accumulation .
this favor@@ able performance led private fore@@ ca@@ sters and government officials to predict continued strong growth in 2011 , with higher production , employment , and incomes leading to further increases in consumer spending and a self-@@ sustaining recovery .
a one-@@ year cut of the pay@@ roll tax rate by two percentage points was en@@ acted in order to lock in this favor@@ able out@@ look .
unfortunately , the projected recovery in consumer spending didn ’ t occur .
the rise in food and energy prices out@@ pac@@ ed the gain in nomin@@ al wages , causing real average weekly ear@@ nings to decline in january , while the continued fall in home prices reduced wealth for the majority of households .
as a result , real personal consumer expen@@ di@@ tures rose at an annual rate of just about 1 % in january , down from the previous quarter ’ s 4 % increase .
that pattern of rising prices and declining real ear@@ nings repeated itself in february and march , with a sharp rise in the consumer price index causing real average weekly ear@@ nings to decline at an annual rate of more than 5 % .
not surprisingly , survey measures of consumer senti@@ ment fell shar@@ ply and consumer spending remained almost flat from month to month .
the fall in house prices pushed down sales of both new and existing homes .
that , in turn , caused a dramatic decline in the volume of housing starts and housing construction .
that decline is likely to continue , because nearly 30 % of homes with mort@@ g@@ ages are worth less than the value of the mortgage .
this creates a strong incentive to default , because mort@@ g@@ ages in the us are effectively non-@@ rec@@ our@@ se loans : the credi@@ tor may take the property if the bor@@ ro@@ wer doesn ’ t pay , but cannot take other assets or a portion of wage income .
as a result , 10 % of mort@@ g@@ ages are now in default or forec@@ lo@@ sure , creating an over@@ hang of properties that will have to be sold at declining prices .
businesses have responded nega@@ tively to the weakness of household demand , with indi@@ ces main@@ tained by the institute of supply management falling for both manufacturing and service firms .
although large firms continue to have very substantial cash on their balance sheets , their cash flow from current operations fell in the first quarter .
the most recent measure of orders for non@@ defense capital goods sign@@ aled a decline in business investment .
the pattern of weakness accelerated in april and may .
the relatively rapid rise in pay@@ roll employment that occurred in the first four months of the year came to a halt in may , when only 5@@ 4,000 new jobs were created , less than one-third of the average for employment growth in the first four months .
the bond market and share prices have responded to all of this bad news in a predictable fashion .
the interest rate on 10-@@ year government bonds fell to 3 % , and the stock market declined for six weeks in a row , the longest be@@ ar@@ ish stretch since 2002 , with a cumulative fall in share prices of more than 6 % .
lower share prices will now have negative effects on consumer spending and business investment .
mon@@ etary and fiscal policies cannot be expected to turn this situation around .
the us federal reserve will maintain its policy of keeping the overnight interest rate at near zero ; but , given a fear of asse@@ t-@@ price bubbles , it will not reverse its decision to end its policy of buying treas@@ ury bonds – so-called “ quantitative e@@ asing ” – at the end of june .
moreover , fiscal policy will actually be contra@@ c@@ tionary in the months ahead .
the fis@@ cal@@ -@@ stimulus program en@@ acted in 2009 is coming to an end , with stimulus spending declining from $ 400 billion in 2010 to only $ 13@@ 7 billion this year .
and negotiations are under way to cut spending more and raise taxes in order to reduce further the fiscal defic@@ its projected for 2011 and later years .
so the near-@@ term out@@ look for the us economy is weak at best .
fundamental policy changes will probably have to wait until after the presidential and con@@ gressi@@ onal elections in november 2012 .
new york – seven years after the global financial crisis erup@@ ted in 2008 , the world economy continued to stum@@ ble in 2015 .
according to the united nations ’ report world economic situation and pro@@ spe@@ cts 20@@ 16 , the average growth rate in developed economies has declined by more than 54 % since the crisis .
an estimated 44 million people are unemployed in developed countries , about 12 million more than in 2007 , while inflation has reached its lowest level since the crisis .
more wor@@ ry@@ ingly , advanced countries ’ growth rates have also become more vola@@ tile .
this is surprising , because , as developed economies with fully open capital accounts , they should have benef@@ ited from the free flow of capital and international risk sharing – and thus experienced little macro@@ economic vola@@ tili@@ ty .
furthermore , social transfers , including unemployment benefits , should have allowed households to stabilize their consumption .
but the dominant policies during the post-@@ crisis period – fiscal re@@ tren@@ chment and quantitative e@@ asing ( q@@ e ) by major central banks – have offered little support to stimulate household consumption , investment , and growth .
on the contrary , they have ten@@ ded to make matters worse .
in the us , quantitative e@@ asing did not boost consumption and investment partly because most of the additional liqui@@ dity returned to central banks ’ co@@ ff@@ ers in the form of excess reserves .
the financial services regul@@ atory relief act of 2006 , which auth@@ orized the federal reserve to pay interest on required and excess reserves , thus under@@ min@@ ed the key objective of q@@ e .
indeed , with the us financial sector on the br@@ ink of collapse , the emergency economic stabili@@ zation act of 2008 moved up the effective date for offering interest on reserves by three years , to october 1 , 2008 .
as a result , excess reserves held at the fed so@@ ared , from an average of $ 200 billion during 200@@ 0-@@ 2008 to $ 1.@@ 6 trillion during 200@@ 9@@ -@@ 2015 .
financial institutions chose to keep their money with the fed instead of len@@ ding to the real economy , earning nearly $ 30 billion – completely ris@@ k-@@ free – during the last five years .
this amounts to a generous – and largely hidden – subsi@@ dy from the fed to the financial sector .
and , as a consequence of the fed ’ s interest@@ -@@ rate hi@@ ke last month , the subsi@@ dy will increase by $ 13 billion this year .
per@@ verse incentives are only one reason that many of the hop@@ ed-@@ for benefits of low interest rates did not materi@@ alize .
given that q@@ e managed to sustain near-@@ zero interest rates for almost seven years , it should have encouraged governments in developed countries to borrow and invest in infrastructure , education , and social sectors .
increasing social transfers during the post-@@ crisis period would have boo@@ sted aggregate demand and smo@@ oth@@ ed out consumption patterns .
moreover , the un report clearly shows that , throughout the developed world , private investment did not grow as one might have expected , given ultra-@@ low interest rates .
in 17 of the 20 largest developed economies , investment growth remained lower during the post-@@ 2008 period than in the years prior to the crisis ; five experienced a decline in investment during 20@@ 10-@@ 2015 .
globally , debt se@@ curi@@ ties issued by non-@@ financial corporations – which are supposed to under@@ take fixed investments – increased significantly during the same period .
consistent with other evidence , this impli@@ es that many non-@@ financial corporations bor@@ rowed , taking advantage of the low interest rates .
but , rather than investing , they used the bor@@ rowed money to buy back their own equi@@ ties or purchase other financial assets .
q@@ e thus stimul@@ ated sharp increases in leverage , market capit@@ alization , and finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ sector profit@@ ability .
clearly , keeping interest rates at the near zero level does not necessarily lead to higher levels of credit or investment .
when banks are given the freedom to choose , they choose ris@@ kl@@ ess profit or even financial specu@@ lation over len@@ ding that would support the broader objective of economic growth .
by contrast , when the world bank or the international mon@@ etary fund l@@ ends cheap money to developing countries , it im@@ poses conditions on what they can do with it .
to have the des@@ ired effect , q@@ e should have been accompanied not only by official efforts to restore impaired len@@ ding channels ( especially those directed at small@@ - and medi@@ um-@@ size enter@@ pris@@ es ) , but also by specific len@@ ding targets for banks .
instead of effectively encouraging banks not to l@@ end , the fed should have been pen@@ alizing banks for holding excess reserves .
while ultra-@@ low interest rates yiel@@ ded few benefits for developed countries , they imposed significant costs on developing and emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market economies .
an unintended , but not unexpected , consequence of mon@@ etary e@@ asing has been sharp increases in cross-@@ border capital flows .
total capital in@@ flows to developing countries increased from about $ 20 billion in 2008 to over $ 600 billion in 2010 .
at the time , many emerging markets had a hard time managing the sudden surge of capital flows .
very little of it went to fixed investment .
in fact , investment growth in developing countries slowed significantly during the post crisis period .
this year , developing countries , taken together , are expected to record their first net capital out@@ flow – tot@@ aling $ 6@@ 15 billion – since 2006 .
neither mon@@ etary policy nor the financial sector is doing what it ’ s supposed to do .
it appears that the flood of liqui@@ dity has dis@@ proportion@@ ately gone toward creating financial wealth and in@@ fl@@ ating asset bubbles , rather than streng@@ th@@ ening the real economy .
despite sharp dec@@ lines in equity prices worldwide , market capit@@ alization as a share of world gdp remains high .
the risk of another financial crisis cannot be ignored .
there are other policies that hold out the promise of restor@@ ing sustainable and inclusive growth .
these begin with re@@ writing the rules of the market economy to ensure greater equality , more long-term thinking , and rein@@ ing in the financial market with effective regulation and appropriate incentive structures .
but large increases in public investment in infrastructure , education , and technology will also be needed .
these will have to be finan@@ ced , at least in part , by the im@@ position of environmental taxes , including carbon taxes , and taxes on the monopoly and other r@@ ents that have become pervasive in the market economy – and contribute enormously to inequality and slow growth .
the views expressed here do not reflect the views of the united nations or its member states .
what should brett@@ on woods ii look like ?
new york – for those of us who have long cla@@ imed that the world ’ s international financial architecture needed deep reform , the call for a “ brett@@ on woods ii ” is welcome .
of course , similar calls were made after the asian and russian crises of 199@@ 7-@@ 1998 , but were not taken seriously by the rich industrial countries .
now that these countries are at the center of the storm , perhaps they will now be serious .
two fundamental problems exist with the call for reform .
first , it lac@@ ks content : it is unclear what any event@@ ual brett@@ on woods ii discussions will be about .
second , the process started the wrong way , by exclu@@ ding most countries from the talks .
it is obviously good for the g-@@ 7 or a sub@@ set of g-@@ 7 members to show leadership , but no fundamental reform can occur without an inclusive process that gives both industrial and developing countries , and both large and small countries an adequate voice .
global institutions , not ad ho@@ c groups of countries , must be at the center of the reform effort .
the clear@@ est issue right now is correc@@ ting the deficit of regulations that characteri@@ zes global financial markets .
discussion must start by agre@@ eing on regul@@ atory principles .
an obvious one is that regulations must be comprehensive , to avoid the massive lo@@ op@@ holes that led to the current tur@@ mo@@ il .
regulations should also have a strong counter-@@ cycli@@ cal focus , preventing exc@@ essive accumulation of leverage and increasing capital and pro@@ visions ( reserves ) during booms , as well as preventing asset price bubbles from feeding into credit expansion .
reli@@ ance on financial institutions ’ internal models , the major focus of the bas@@ el ii agreement on banking regulation , should be dis@@ car@@ ded .
that strategy has now been exposed as per@@ il@@ ous , and the use by financial institutions of similar risk models can lead to greater inst@@ ability .
any new regul@@ atory system should be based on a well functioning network of national and regional authorities ( still missing in the european union ) and include truly international super@@ vision of financial institutions with a global reach .
most agree that the international mon@@ etary fund should not be at the center of the regul@@ atory system .
the bank for international sett@@ lements and the bas@@ el committee are better placed , but a fundamental reform is needed to bro@@ aden their mem@@ ber@@ ship and to avoid a major problem of the bas@@ el committee : its lack of representation of developing countries .
three central issues of imf reform should also be taken on board .
the first is the need for a truly global reserve currency , perhaps based on the imf special drawing rights ( s@@ dr@@ s ) .
this would overcome both the ine@@ qui@@ ties and the inst@@ ability that is inherent in a global reserve system based on a national currency .
today ’ s system is pla@@ gu@@ ed by cycles of confidence in the dollar and by periodic sho@@ cks due to american policies that are adopted independently of their global impact and thus imposed on the rest of the world .
the second issue is the need to place the imf , not the g-@@ 7 – or any other “ g ” – at the center of global macro@@ economic policy coordination .
this is the only way to give developing countries a voice .
the multi@@ lat@@ eral surveillance on global im@@ balances that the fund launched in 2006 was an interesting step in this direction , but it has lac@@ ked commitment by the parties , as well as teeth .
in the case of the imf , the finan@@ cing for such liqui@@ dity could be counter-@@ cycli@@ cal issues of s@@ dr@@ s .
in all these areas , the imf should make more active use of regional institutions .
for a decade , i have proposed that the imf of the future should be seen as the ape@@ x of a network of regional reserve funds – that is , a system closer in design to the european central bank or the united states federal reserve system .
a similar institutional design could be adopted for p@@ ru@@ den@@ tial policies .
a denser network of institutions seems better adapted to a hetero@@ gene@@ ous international community , and it is likely to provide better services and give a stronger voice to smaller countries .
finally , one major defi@@ ci@@ ency of the current international financial architecture is the lack of an institutional framework – i.@@ e. , a court similar to those created to manage bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cies in national economies – to manage debt over@@ hangs at the international level .
the current system reli@@ es on ad ho@@ c mechanisms , which generally operate too late , after high inde@@ b@@ tedness has already imposed devastating effects .
the only regular institutional mechanism is the paris club , which deals exclu@@ sively with official finan@@ cing . brett@@ on woods ii should resolve this problem by creating an international debt court .
the current financial crisis has made the need for reform of the international financial architecture pat@@ ently clear .
but any sum@@ mons to a “ brett@@ on woods ii ” conference must be concrete in its content .
a global system for p@@ ru@@ den@@ tial regulation and super@@ vision ; a re@@ vam@@ ped imf managing a global reserve currency , coordin@@ ating global macro@@ economic policy , and providing agile credit lines ; and an international debt court – all of these must be on the agenda .
what ’ s in a bri@@ c ?
sao paulo – brazil , russia , india , and china recently held their second annual summit in brasili@@ a .
journalists continue to la@@ vis@@ h attention on these so-called “ bri@@ c ” countries , but i remain skeptical of the concept .
goldman sachs coined the term in 2001 to call attention to profitable opportunities in what it considered “ emerging markets . ”
the bri@@ cs ’ share of world gdp rose from 16 % in 2000 to 22 % in 2008 .
collectively they did better than average in the subsequ@@ ent global recession . together , they account for 42 % of world population and one-third of global economic growth in the past ten years .
putting aside the united states ( which ran@@ ks third in population ) , annual economic growth in the other four most popul@@ ous countries – china , india , indonesia , and brazil – was above 5-@@ 6 % in 200@@ 0-@@ 2009 .
obviously , that is good news for the world economy , but an economic term has taken on a political life of its own , despite the fact that russia fits poorly in the category .
the bri@@ cs hold $ 2.@@ 8 trillion or 42 % of global foreign reserves ( though most of that is chinese . )
so , in ye@@ kat@@ er@@ in@@ burg , russian president d@@ mit@@ ri med@@ ve@@ de@@ v declared that “ there can be no successful global currency system if the financial instruments that are used are denomin@@ ated in only one currency . ” after china ec@@ lip@@ sed the us as brazil ’ s largest trading partner , china and brazil announced plans to settle trade in their national curren@@ cies rather than dollars .
although russia accounts for only 5 % of china ’ s trade , the two countries announced a similar agreement .
after the recent financial crisis , goldman sachs upp@@ ed the ante and projected that the combined gdp of the bri@@ cs might exce@@ ed that of the g-@@ 7 countries by 20@@ 27 , about 10 years sooner than initially believed .
such simple extra@@ po@@ lations of current economic growth rates often turn out to be mista@@ ken because of un@@ fores@@ een events .
but , whatever the mer@@ its of this linear economic projection , the term bri@@ cs still makes little sense for long-term assess@@ ments of global power relations .
while a bri@@ cs meeting may be convenient for coordin@@ ating some short-term diplo@@ matic tactics , the term lum@@ ps together disparate countries that have deep di@@ visions .
it makes little sense to include russia , a former superpower , with three developing economies .
of the four members , russia has the smallest and most literate population and a much higher per capita income , but , more importantly , many obser@@ vers believe that russia is declining while the other three are rising in power resources .
russia today not only suffers more from the after@@ math of the global recession , but it faces severe long-term li@@ abilities : a lack of diversi@@ fied exports , severe demographic and health problems , and , in med@@ ve@@ de@@ v ’ s own words , an urgent need for “ moderni@@ zation . ”
as the financial times recently pointed out , just two decades ago “ russia was a scientific superpower , carrying out more research than china , india and brazil combined .
since then it has been left behind not only by the world-@@ beating growth of chinese science but also by india and brazil . ”
when one looks closely at the numbers , the heart of the bri@@ c acronym is the rise in china ’ s resources , but the role of brazil is a pleasant surprise .
when the bri@@ c acronym was first invented , the economist obje@@ cted that “ a country with a growth rate as sk@@ imp@@ y as its swi@@ m@@ suits , prey to any financial crisis that was around , a place of chronic political inst@@ ability , whose infinite capacity to squ@@ ander its obvious potential was as legendary as its talent for football and carni@@ vals , did not seem to belong with those emerging ti@@ tans . ”
now , as the economist notes , “ in some ways , brazil out@@ classes the other bri@@ cs .
unlike china , it is a democracy .
unlike india , it has no insur@@ g@@ ents , no ethnic and religious conflicts nor hostile neighbors .
unlike russia , it exports more than oil and arms and tre@@ ats foreign investors with respect . ”
since cur@@ bing inflation and institu@@ ting market reforms in the 1990 ’ s , brazil has shown an impressive rate of economic growth in the range of 5 % .
with a territory nearly three times the size of india ’ s , 90 % of its 200 million people literate , a $ 2 trillion gdp equivalent to russia ’ s and per capita income of $ 10,000 ( three times india ’ s and nearly twice china ’ s ) , brazil has impressive power resources .
in 2007 , the discovery of massive offshore oil reserves promised to make brazil a significant power in the energy arena as well .
brazil , like the other bri@@ cs , also faces a serious number of problems .
it ran@@ ks 7@@ 5@@ th out of 180 countries on transparency international ’ s corruption perceptions index ( compared to 7@@ 9@@ th for china , 8@@ 4@@ th for india , and 14@@ 6@@ th for russia ) .
the world economic forum ran@@ ks brazil 5@@ 6@@ th among 13@@ 3 countries in terms of economic competi@@ tiveness ( compared to 29@@ th for china , 4@@ 9@@ th for india , and 6@@ 3@@ rd for russia ) .
poverty and inequality remain serious problems .
brazil ’ s g@@ ini co@@ efficient is .@@ 57 ( 1.@@ 0 is perfect inequality , with one person receiving all income ) , compared to .@@ 45 for the united states , .@@ 42 for china , .@@ 37 for india and .@@ 42 for russia .
so , how seriously should analy@@ sts take the term bri@@ c ?
as an indic@@ ator of economic opportunity , they should welcome it , though it would make more sense if indonesia replaced russia .
in political terms , china , india , and russia are competitors for power in asia , and brazil and india have been hurt by china ’ s under@@ valued currency .
thus , bri@@ c is not likely to become a serious political organization of like@@ -@@ minded states .
what size is the fire exit ?
brus@@ sels – the euro@@ zone is being thrown into tur@@ mo@@ il by a collective rush to the ex@@ its by investors .
yields on government debt of peripher@@ al euro@@ zone countries are sky@@ rock@@ eting , because investors do not really know what the risks are .
officials want to be reas@@ suring .
investors should not worry , they argue , because the current bail@@ out mechanism – the european financial stability facility ( ef@@ sf ) – has worked so far without any hair@@ cut for bon@@ d@@ holders , and will continue to be applied until about 2013 .
only after that date would any new mechanism open the door for losses for private investors , and only for debt issued after that date .
but markets do not trust this message – and for good reason : it is not credible , because it makes no economic sense .
moreover , for too many investors , portugal , with its poor growth pro@@ spe@@ cts and in@@ sufficient domestic savings to fund the publi@@ c-@@ sector deficit , looks like greece .
and spain clearly has to gra@@ pple with its own ir@@ ish problem , namely a huge housing over-@@ hang – and probably large losses in the banking sector – following the collapse of an out@@ sized real-@@ estate bubble .
the problems of portugal and spain might be less severe than those of greece and ireland , but this apparently is not enough to indu@@ ce investors to buy their government debt .
a danger these countries share is thus the acute danger of large-scale runs on their banking systems .
so far , investors trying to exit first have been made whole .
holders of greek debt ma@@ turing now are re@@ paid cour@@ tes@@ y of the € 110 billion bail@@ out program , and holders of ir@@ ish bank bonds have been given a guarantee by the ir@@ ish government , whose promises have in turn been under@@ written by the ef@@ sf .
the ef@@ sf will also provide funds to ensure that ir@@ ish banks ’ de@@ posit@@ ors can get their money back today .
the problem with this approach is that it creates the wrong incentives .
investors have now learned that the first to sell will avoid losses .
the situation resem@@ bles that of a crowded cinema with only one exit .
everyone knows that in case of fire , only the first to leave will be safe .
so , if the exit is small , even the fa@@ in@@ test whi@@ ff of smoke can trigger a stam@@ pe@@ de .
but if the exit looks comfort@@ ably large , the public will be much more likely to remain calm , even if parts of the room are already filling with smoke .
for the financial market , the size of the exit depends on the funds available to make short-term investors whole .
unfortunately , the size of the ef@@ sf looks inadequate to finance a collective exit by short-term investors .
when the ef@@ sf was created , it was assumed that the only problem was to ensure finan@@ cing for the government defic@@ its of the four pro@@ spe@@ ctive problem countries ( portugal , ireland , greece , and spain ) .
from this perspective , the headline figure of € 750 billion allo@@ cated to the ef@@ sf looked adequate .
but the ef@@ sf ’ s founders did not take into account banks ’ enormous short-term li@@ abilities , which in a crisis effectively become government debt , as ireland has been the most recent to demonstrate .
the ef@@ sf might be just enough to guarantee the public debt of the four problem countries , but certainly not their banking sectors ’ li@@ abilities as well .
for example , the spanish banking sector alone has short-term li@@ abilities of several hundred billion euros .
to return to the cinema analogy : investors know that the exit is not large enough to allow them all to squeeze through at the same time .
the official line so far has been “ no default , ” meaning no sovereig@@ n default or that of any bank can be considered .
if this line is to be main@@ tained , the exit door must immediately be made much wider , and huge fire ex@@ t@@ ingu@@ is@@ hers must be brand@@ ished .
the international mon@@ etary fund and the european central bank must show investors that they have enough funding to finance the simul@@ taneous exit of all short-term investors .
it could work .
a show of overwhelming force might restore calm to the markets .
but it is a risky proposition : if investors exit nonetheless , the required funds might be so large that credi@@ tor countries ’ taxpa@@ yers ’ revol@@ t .
the alternative is to change strategy and focus instead on investors ’ incentives .
patient investors should be rewar@@ ded .
in particular , they should be able to expect to be better off than those rus@@ hing to the exit .
this approach depends on two major policy shifts .
first , governments should not be pushed into in@@ sol@@ ven@@ cy just to save all banks .
this means that the ir@@ ish government ( maybe the next one ) should demand that holders of bank bonds share the losses , perhaps by offering them a simple deb@@ t-@@ equity swap .
doub@@ ts about the ir@@ ish government ’ s sol@@ ven@@ cy would then disappear quickly , and its guarantee of bank depos@@ its would no longer look so sha@@ ky .
something similar might have to be done for the spanish banking system ’ s exposure to the local housing market .
the second component of a permanent anti-@@ crisis mechanism is a floor for bond prices – and thus a ceiling for losses .
the yields and vola@@ tili@@ ty of lon@@ ger-@@ term bonds should then fall relative to short-term se@@ curi@@ ties , allowing peripher@@ al governments to finance themselves reli@@ ably and at reasonable cost .
none of this would resolve europe ’ s fundamental problems , namely weak fiscal positions , poorly functioning financial sectors , and lack of competi@@ tiveness .
but all of them would be easier to manage with cal@@ mer financial markets .
what ’ s left after 1989 ?
new york – twenty years ago , when the berlin wall was bre@@ ached and the soviet empire was collap@@ sing , only die-@@ hard belie@@ vers in a communist utopia felt unhappy .
a few people , of course , c@@ lung to the possibility of what was once called “ actually existing soci@@ alism . ”
others criticized the trium@@ p@@ hal@@ ism of the “ new world order ” promised by george h@@ .@@ w. bush .
and the way west germany rolled over the wre@@ ck@@ age of its east german neighbor seemed almost like an act of cru@@ el@@ ty .
still , 1989 was a good time to be alive ( except in china , where the democrats were put down ) .
many of us felt that we were seeing the dawn of a new liberal age , in which freedom and justice would spread , like fresh flowers , across the globe .
twenty years on , we know this was not to be .
xen@@ opho@@ bic popu@@ li@@ sm is stal@@ king democracies in europe .
soci@@ al-@@ democratic parties are shrinking , while right-@@ wing de@@ ma@@ go@@ gues promise to protect “ western values ” from the islamic hor@@ des .
and the economic de@@ bac@@ les of the last few years seem to bear out mik@@ ha@@ il gor@@ bach@@ e@@ v ’ s recent warning that “ western capitalism , too , depri@@ ved of its old ad@@ versary and imagining itself the un@@ dispu@@ ted vic@@ tor and incar@@ nation of global progress , is at risk of leading western society and the rest of the world down another historical blind alley . ”
the way it looks now , liberals , in the “ progressive ” american sense of the word , may actually have been among the los@@ ers of 1989 .
social democrats were always des@@ pis@@ ed by comm@@ uni@@ sts , and vice versa .
but many soci@@ al-@@ democratic ideals , rooted in mar@@ x@@ ist notions of social justice and equality , were thrown out , like the pro@@ ver@@ bial baby , with the bath@@ water of communism .
this process was already underway before the fall of the berlin wall , with the free-@@ market radi@@ cal@@ ism of the th@@ at@@ cher@@ -@@ reagan era .
society , margaret th@@ at@@ cher once famously declared , doesn ’ t exist .
only individuals and families counted .
it was everyone for themselves .
for many people , this had the ring of liberation – from over@@ regulated markets , over@@ bearing trade uni@@ ons , and class privilege . that is why it was called neo-@@ liber@@ alism .
but free-@@ market radi@@ cal@@ ism under@@ min@@ ed the role of the state in building a better , more just , and more equal society .
neo-@@ liberals are not so much interested in justice as in greater efficiency , more productivity , the bottom line .
at the same time that neo-@@ liberals were slas@@ hing and burning their way through old soci@@ al-@@ democratic arrangements , the left was dissi@@ p@@ ating its energi@@ es on cultural politics , “ identity , ” and ideological mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ alism .
democratic ide@@ alism was once the domain of the left , including social democrats and liberals .
in the united states , it was democrats , such as john f@@ . kennedy , who promot@@ ed freedom around the world .
but , in the late twen@@ tieth century , it became more important to many le@@ f@@ ti@@ sts to save “ third world ” culture , no matter how barbar@@ ic , from “ neo-@@ coloni@@ alism , ” than to support equality and democracy .
people on the left would defend brutal dictators ( ca@@ stro , mao , pol pot , k@@ hom@@ ein@@ i , et al . ) simply because they opposed “ western imperi@@ alism . ”
as a result , all politics that were derived , no matter how loo@@ sely , from mar@@ x@@ ism , lost credi@@ bility , and finally died in 1989 .
this was naturally a disaster for comm@@ uni@@ sts and soci@@ alists , but also for social democrats , for they had lost an ideological basis for their ide@@ alism .
and , without ide@@ alism , politics becomes a form of accounting , a management of purely material interests .
this explains why itali@@ ans , and later tha@@ is , chose business ty@@ co@@ ons to lead their countries .
they hoped that men who managed to accumulate so much personal wealth could do the same for their voters .
yet the rhetoric of ide@@ alism has not quite disappeared .
it merely shifted from left to right .
once the left abandoned the language of internation@@ alism – democratic revolution , national liberation , and so forth – it was taken up by neo-@@ conservatives .
their promotion of american military force as the strong arm of democracy may have been mis@@ guided , crude , arrogant , ignorant , na@@ ï@@ ve , and deeply dangerous , but it was in@@ dispu@@ tably ide@@ alistic .
the all@@ ure of revolutionary é@@ lan has drawn some former le@@ f@@ ti@@ sts to the neo-@@ conservative side .
but most liberals were deeply al@@ armed by the neo-@@ con@@ s , without being able to find a coherent answer .
having lost their own z@@ est for internation@@ alism , a common response among liberals to neo-@@ con radi@@ cal@@ ism has been a call for “ re@@ alism , ” non-@@ interference in others ’ affairs , and with@@ dra@@ wal from the world .
this may be the wiser course in many cases , but it is hardly inspiring .
so it is no wonder that a left-@@ wing internation@@ alist , such as french foreign minister bern@@ ard k@@ ou@@ ch@@ ner , has found a kind of home for his ide@@ alism in ni@@ col@@ as sar@@ ko@@ zy ’ s conservative government .
for the first time since the kennedy administration , the us is one of the only liberal democracies in the world with a cen@@ ter-@@ left government .
can president obama lead the way to a new era of social and political ide@@ alism ?
it seems unlikely .
his efforts to provide better healthcare for americans , for example , is not so much an innovation , as an attempt to catch up with arrangements which most europeans and japanese have long taken for granted .
and for this he is already being called a “ soci@@ alist ” by his enemies .
obama is neither a soci@@ alist , nor a mere political accoun@@ tant .
he has some modest ideals , and may yet be an excellent president .
but what is needed to revi@@ ve liberal ide@@ alism is a set of new ideas on how to promote justice , equality and freedom in the world .
reagan , th@@ at@@ cher , and gor@@ bach@@ e@@ v , assi@@ sted in the end of an ideology , which once offered hope , and inspired real progress , but resulted in slavery and mass murder .
we are still waiting for a new vision , which will lead to progress , but this time , we hope , without tyran@@ ny .
what ’ s left of con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism ?
beijing – the chinese government ’ s very public display of compassion and transparency in response to the devastating earthquake in sich@@ u@@ an province appears to have streng@@ th@@ ened its authority and its bonds with ordinary chinese people .
the government and army worked hand in hand with legi@@ ons of volunteers and private networks to rescue quake victims .
even die-@@ hard cy@@ ni@@ cs were won over by prime minister wen ji@@ ab@@ ao ’ s emotional com@@ for@@ ting of the survivors .
but heroic rescue efforts will not be able to help the government forever , so it is worth asking what can provide long-term political legiti@@ macy .
after all , communism has lost its capacity to inspire the chinese .
so what should replace it ?
most westerners think the answer is liberal democracy , as did many chinese liberals in the twen@@ tieth century .
but there is another answer , which takes the form of the old and v@@ ener@@ able tradition of con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism , which is being revi@@ ved by government officials , critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , and ordinary citizens .
the opening ceremony of the olympic games will highlight this revi@@ val : it will feature not quotes from marx , but sa@@ y@@ ings from the anal@@ ec@@ ts of con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us .
such sa@@ y@@ ings as “ the world ’ s peoples are all brothers ” and “ isn ’ t one of life ’ s greatest pleas@@ ures to have friends visiting from af@@ ar ? ” will be be@@ amed to billions worldwide , expressing the best that chinese culture has to offer .
here , however , we run into trouble .
ever since the han dy@@ nasty ( more than 2,000 years ago ) , chinese governments have manipulated the most promin@@ ent political interpre@@ tations of con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism for their own purposes .
con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism has been combined with legal@@ ism , china ’ s other main political tradition , to justify such practices as blind obe@@ di@@ ence to the rul@@ er , sub@@ ordin@@ ation of women , and the use of harsh pun@@ ish@@ ments .
the “ official ” con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism being revi@@ ved today may be less dangerous – it emphasi@@ zes social harmony , meaning the peaceful resolution of conflicts – but it remains a conservative morality .
but there is another interpretation of con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism – let ’ s call it “ left con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism ” – that stres@@ ses intellec@@ tu@@ als ’ obligation to critici@@ ze bad policies , obli@@ ges governments to provide for the people ’ s material well-being and support those without key family relations , and calls for governments to adopt a more internation@@ al-@@ minded out@@ look and to rely on moral power rather than military might to pursue political aims .
it leaves open basic meta@@ physical commit@@ ments and takes a plu@@ ral and tolerant view of religious life .
it emphasi@@ zes equality of opportunity in education as well as merito@@ cracy in government , with leadership positions being distributed to the community ’ s most virtu@@ ous and qualified members .
such values owe their origin to the “ original con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism ” of con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us , men@@ ci@@ us , and x@@ un@@ zi , which existed before con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism became established as state orthodo@@ xy .
in imperial times , the critical tradition was carried forward by such scholars as hu@@ ang zon@@ g@@ x@@ i .
today , new con@@ fu@@ cian le@@ f@@ ti@@ sts such as gan yang are calling for the creation of a “ con@@ fu@@ cian soci@@ alist republic . ”
con@@ fu@@ cian scholars such as ji@@ ang q@@ ing open@@ ly acknowledge that their interpretation of con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism most closely parall@@ els soci@@ alist ideals : not the “ actually existing soci@@ alism ” in today ’ s china , but the soci@@ alist ideals defen@@ ded by karl marx and others .
this con@@ fu@@ cian tradition aims to influence contemporary politics , but it also remains separate from state power and orthodo@@ xy , always ready to point to the gap between ideals and reality .
indeed , left con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism ’ s de@@ par@@ ture from the status quo is precisely the point : it is meant to provide a moral standard for social cri@@ tics and to inspire visions of a more des@@ ir@@ able political future .
unlike communism , it offers a future that deri@@ ves its legiti@@ macy from tradition and building upon what the past has to offer – including the soci@@ alist tradition – rather than destroying it .
thus , left con@@ fu@@ cians favor institutional reform , arguing that the long-term stability and legiti@@ macy of political institutions requires that they be founded on chinese traditions .
ji@@ ang q@@ ing advoc@@ ates a tri@@ -@@ camer@@ al legis@@ l@@ ature – a democra@@ tically elected people ’ s house representing the common people ’ s interests , a house of exempl@@ ary persons to secure the good of all those affected by government policies , including foreig@@ ners and minority groups , and a house of cultural continuity that would maintain china ’ s various religions and traditions .
such concrete pro@@ pos@@ als for political reform inspired by con@@ fu@@ cian values can rarely be published in main@@ land china .
in fact , there are fewer constraints imposed on public discussion of liber@@ al-@@ democratic institutions precisely because few chinese are inspired by western@@ -@@ style liberal democracy .
today , the most viable alternative to china ’ s political status quo is left con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism .
what &apos;s new about the new all-@@ afghan army ?
the murder of afghanistan &apos;s minister of aviation by a mo@@ b ( perhaps inc@@ ited by members of afghanistan &apos;s own inter@@ im administration ) shows that afghan society remains deeply fis@@ su@@ red .
the first reforms to afghanistan &apos;s army will only make these di@@ visions worse .
the minister of defense in ham@@ id kar@@ za@@ i &apos;s temporary administration in kabul has already named the top officers of this new army .
the minister , general mohammed fa@@ him , is a ta@@ j@@ ik from the pan@@ j@@ shi@@ r district in the north , who rose three months ago to command the northern alliance forces that captured kabul after american bom@@ bers clear@@ ed the way for them .
as a group , his ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ments pose a direct challenge to mr. kar@@ za@@ i &apos;s goal of re@@ uni@@ fying the country .
afghanistan is a multi-@@ ethnic nation , the largest group being pas@@ ht@@ uns , with two-@@ fif@@ ths of the total .
ha@@ zar@@ as and ta@@ ji@@ ks constit@@ ute about a fifth each of the population .
of thir@@ ty-@@ eight officers elevated to general &apos;s rank by mr. fa@@ him , thir@@ ty-@@ seven are ta@@ ji@@ ks , the other being u@@ z@@ be@@ k .
if any of the country &apos;s fifteen to sevent@@ een million pas@@ ht@@ uns are recru@@ ited as soldiers , they will serve under a command structure made up almost entirely of ta@@ ji@@ ks .
the pas@@ ht@@ uns &apos; language , however , is as different from ta@@ j@@ ik as spanish is from english and millions of pas@@ ht@@ uns of military age know only a sma@@ tter@@ ing of ta@@ j@@ ik , at best .
the geographical profile of the new military leadership is as narrow as its ethnic makeup .
thir@@ ty-@@ five of the thir@@ ty-@@ eight senior officers ha@@ il from one small area north of kabul consi@@ sting of par@@ wan province ( where the bag@@ ram airport is located ) and the nearby pan@@ j@@ shi@@ r valley , long the northern alliance &apos;s stron@@ gh@@ old .
stated differently , potential leaders from twenty-@@ seven of afghanistan &apos;s twenty-@@ nine provin@@ ces were exclu@@ ded from their country &apos;s new military elite .
perhaps so nar@@ ro@@ w-@@ based a group could overcome the impression that its members are a closed cli@@ que if they represented a broad cross-@@ section of the country &apos;s dozen or more political parties .
but this is not the case .
eigh@@ teen of the thir@@ ty-@@ eight top br@@ ass come from one party , the jam@@ i@@ at-@@ e-@@ islam@@ i , the islamic faction that has long been led by mulla@@ h and former the@@ ology professor bur@@ han@@ u@@ ddin rab@@ ban@@ i .
it was this party that ruled kabul briefly in the mid-@@ 1990s , creating the blood@@ shed and chaos that caused most afgh@@ ans to welcome the coming of the taliban .
almost equ@@ aling the number of jam@@ i@@ at members in the army hierarchy are comm@@ uni@@ sts .
six@@ teen of the thir@@ ty-@@ eight have long been alig@@ ned with this party , whose plo@@ ys in the late 1970s led to the soviet invasion of 197@@ 9@@ -@@ 89 which cost two-@@ and-a-half million afghan lives .
most afgh@@ ans today view the comm@@ uni@@ sts with the same degree of sympathy that c@@ ze@@ chs or poles reserve for hitler &apos;s national soci@@ alists .
true , people in afghanistan , as elsewhere , joined the communist party for various reasons , and by no means were all of them hard-@@ core ide@@ olo@@ gues .
but in the case of general fa@@ him &apos;s gener@@ als , six were professional communist party workers , and continued to serve the party after the red army &apos;s invasion .
all six of these men , plus three more comm@@ uni@@ sts who served as officers in the afghan army , collabor@@ ated actively during the soviet &apos;s deca@@ de-@@ long occupation of afghanistan .
imagine how the french would have re@@ acted if a quarter of france &apos;s post-@@ world war ii officer corps had si@@ ded with the wehr@@ macht during its occupation of their country .
in afghanistan news travels quickly by word of mouth .
afghan nation@@ alists ( which includes nearly all afgh@@ ans ) will soon discover the political backgrounds of members of general fa@@ him &apos;s inner circle , if they don &apos;t know already .
even this overwhelming evidence of one-@@ side@@ dness and bias in the formation of the new army &apos;s high command could be neutr@@ alized if the gener@@ als brought profession@@ alism and commitment to the patri@@ otic values of a truly national armed forces to their work .
unfortunately , only ten of the thir@@ ty-@@ eight br@@ ass promot@@ ed by fa@@ him have backgrounds as professional military officers .
an el@@ event@@ h served as a pilot .
by contrast , twenty-@@ four of the total ( the backgrounds of the remaining four are unknown ) come from civilian life , whether the professions , communist party offices , or in one case , a career as a mulla@@ h .
what do all these statistics mean in terms of day-to-day reality ?
they mean that when the comman@@ ders of the international peace@@ keeping forces in afghanistan , as well as american military and diplo@@ matic officials , meet afghanistan &apos;s de@@ pu@@ ty minister of defense they will encounter ab@@ dul ras@@ hid do@@ st@@ um , a not@@ ori@@ ously brutal and corrupt war@@ lord and communist who keeps in touch with old red army friends still serving in moscow .
it means that the chief of the afghan armed forces , as well as the chief of operations and the chief of army intelligence are also comm@@ uni@@ sts , men whose loy@@ alties remain un@@ certain and are di@@ stru@@ sted by most afgh@@ ans .
is this a team likely to bring war@@ -@@ torn afghanistan together ?
is the presence in kabul of so du@@ bi@@ ous a crew likely to in@@ still confidence in the three-@@ quarters of afghanistan &apos;s population who are shut out of the top army command ?
or is this list , rather , the harvest of a &quot; w@@ inner@@ -@@ take-@@ all &quot; approach to governance that is bound ( at some future point ) to unle@@ ash another bloody national bac@@ klas@@ h by those whose legitimate interests have been cy@@ ni@@ cally tra@@ m@@ pled ?
un , european , and american policymakers should pon@@ der these questions before allowing themselves to acqui@@ es@@ ce in a ru@@ th@@ less power grab by a small and un@@ popular minority .
what ’ s so good about america ’ s tax package ?
cambridge – the tax package agreed to by president barack obama and his republican oppon@@ ents in the united states congress represents the right mix of an appropriate short-@@ run fiscal policy and a first step toward lon@@ ger-@@ term fiscal p@@ ru@@ dence .
the key feature of the agreement is to continue the existing 2010 in@@ com@@ e-@@ tax rates for another two years with no commitment about what will happen to tax rates after that .
without that agreement , tax rates would have rever@@ ted in 2011 to the higher level that prevail@@ ed before the bush tax cuts of 2001 .
that would mean higher taxes for all taxpa@@ yers , raising tax li@@ abilities in 2011 and 2012 by about $ 450 billion ( 1.5 % of gdp ) .
because america ’ s gdp has recently been growing at an annual rate of only about 2 % – and final sales at only about 1 % – such a tax increase would probably have pushed the us economy into a new recession .
although the new tax law is generally described as a fiscal stimulus , it is more accurate to say that it avo@@ ids a large immediate fiscal contra@@ ction .
the long-term implications of the agreement stand in sharp contrast both to obama ’ s february 2010 budget proposal and to the republicans ’ counter-@@ proposal .
obama wanted to continue the 2010 tax rates permanently for all taxpa@@ yers except those with annual incomes over $ 250,000 .
the republicans proposed continuing the 2010 tax rates permanently for all taxpa@@ yers .
by agre@@ eing to limit the current tax rates for just two years , the tax package reduces the projected national debt at the end of the decade ( relative to what it would have been with the obama budget ) by some $ 2 trillion or nearly 10 % of gdp in 2020 .
that reduction in potential defic@@ its and debt can by itself give a boost to the economy in 2011 by cal@@ ming fears that an explo@@ ding national debt would eventually force the federal reserve to raise interest rates – perhaps shar@@ ply if foreign bu@@ yers of us treas@@ u@@ ries suddenly became frightened by the deficit pro@@ spe@@ cts .
the official budget arithmetic will treat the agreement on person@@ al-@@ income tax rates as a $ 450 billion increase in the deficit , making it seem like a big fiscal stimulus .
but the agreement only main@@ tains the existing tax rates , so taxpa@@ yers do not see it as a tax cut .
it would be a fiscal stimulus only if taxpa@@ yers had previously expected that congress and the administration would allow the tax rates to rise – an unlikely prospect , given the highly ad@@ verse effects that doing so would have had on the currently weak economy .
even for those taxpa@@ yers who had fe@@ ared a tax increase in 2011 and 2012 , it is not clear how much the lower tax payments will actually boost consumer spending .
the previous temporary tax cuts in 2008 and 2009 appear to have gone largely into saving and debt reduction rather than increased spending .
it is surprising , therefore , that fore@@ ca@@ sters raised their gdp growth fore@@ ca@@ sts for 2011 significantly on the basis of the tax agreement .
a typical reaction was to raise the forecast for 2011 from 2.5 % to 3.5 % .
while an increase of this magnitude would be plau@@ sible if a fore@@ ca@@ ster had previously expected tax rates to increase in 2011 , it would not have been reasonable to forecast 2.5 % growth in the first place with that assumption in mind .
so , either the initial 2.5 % forecast was too high or the increase of one percentage point is too large .
what is true of the agreement is also true of the decision , as part of that agreement , to maintain unemployment insurance benefits for the long-term unemployed .
this , too , is essentially just a continu@@ ation of the status quo .
no new benefit has been created .
the most substantial potential boost to spending comes from a temporary reduction of the pay@@ roll tax , lower@@ ing the rate paid by employees on income up to about $ 100,000 from 6.@@ 2 % to 4.@@ 2 % .
but , while the decline in tax payments will be about 0.@@ 8 % of gdp , it is not clear how much of this will translate into additional consumer spending and how much into additional saving .
because this tax cut will take the form of lower with@@ holding from weekly or monthly wages , it may seem more permanent than it really is , and therefore have a greater impact on spending than households ’ very fe@@ e@@ ble response to the previous temporary tax changes .
the final component of the agreement is temporary acceleration of tax de@@ preci@@ ation , allowing firms in 2011 to write off 100 % of capital investment immediately , in contrast to the current rule , which sti@@ pul@@ ates a 50 % immediate wri@@ te-@@ off , followed by de@@ preci@@ ation of the remaining 50 % over the stat@@ u@@ tory life of the equipment .
but , at a time when interest rates are very low and large businesses have enormous amounts of cash on their balance sheets , this change in the timing of tax payments is not likely to do much to stimulate investment .
a greater stimulus to business investment may come from the perception that obama ’ s agreement to extend the person@@ al-@@ income tax cuts for high-@@ income individuals signals his administration ’ s reduced an@@ tag@@ on@@ ism to business and the wealthy .
obama ’ s recent statement that he favor@@ s re@@ forming personal and corporate taxes by lower@@ ing rates and bro@@ aden@@ ing the tax base rein@@ forces that impression .
let ’ s hope that ’ s true .
what ’ s stopping women ?
princeton – when i wrote the cover article of the july / august issue of the atlantic , entitled “ why women still can ’ t have it all , ” i expected a hostile reaction from many american career women of my generation and older , and positive reactions from women aged roughly 25-@@ 35 .
i expected that many men of that younger generation would also have strong reactions , given how many of them are trying to figure out how to be with their children , support their wives ’ careers , and pursue their own plans .
i also expected to hear from business representatives about whether my proposed solutions – greater workplace flexibility , ending the culture of face-@@ time and “ time mach@@ is@@ mo , ” and allowing parents who have been out of the workforce or working part@@ -@@ time to compete equally for top jobs once they re-@@ enter – were feasi@@ ble or utop@@ ian .
what i did not expect was the speed and scale of the reaction – almost a million readers within a week and far too many written responses and tv , radio , and blog deb@@ ates for me to follow – and its global scope .
i have conducted interviews with journalists in britain , germany , norway , india , australia , japan , the netherlands , and brazil ; and articles about the piece have been published in france , ireland , italy , boli@@ via , jama@@ ica , vietnam , israel , lebanon , canada , and many other countries .
reactions differ across countries , of course .
indeed , in many ways , the article is a lit@@ mus test of where individual countries are in their own evolution toward full equality for men and women .
india and britain , for example , have had strong women prime ministers in indi@@ ra gandhi and margaret th@@ at@@ cher , but now must gra@@ pple with the “ wom@@ an-@@ as-@@ man ” archet@@ ype of female success .
the sc@@ andin@@ avian countries know that women around the world look to them as pione@@ ers of social and economic policies that enable women to be mothers and successful career professionals , and that encourage and expect men to play an equal parenting role .
but they are not producing as many women managers in the private sector as the united states is , much less at the top ran@@ ks .
the ger@@ mans are deeply confli@@ cted .
one major german magazine decided to frame my contribution to the debate as “ career woman admit@@ s that it ’ s better to be home . ”
another ( more accurately ) high@@ ligh@@ ted my emphasis on the need for deep social and economic change to allow women to have equal choices .
the french remain studi@@ ously alo@@ of , even a little dis@@ da@@ in@@ ful , as be@@ fits a nation that reje@@ cts “ femin@@ ism ” as an anti-@@ feminine american creation and manages to produce a leader who is simultaneously as accomplished and as elegant as christ@@ ine la@@ gar@@ de , the head of the international mon@@ etary fund .
of course , the example of her pre@@ de@@ cess@@ or , domini@@ que str@@ aus@@ s-@@ kahn , and other stories about french male behavior that would count as clear sexual har@@ ass@@ ment in the sto@@ d@@ gy us , suggest that perhaps a bit more femin@@ is@@ me a la fran@@ ç@@ a@@ ise is in order .
beyond europe , japanese women lam@@ ent how far they must still go in a rel@@ ent@@ lessly male and sex@@ ist culture .
the chinese now have a generation of educated , empowered young women who are not sure whether they want to marry at all , o@@ wing to the constraints that a husband ( and a mother@@ -in-law ) would place on their freedom .
brazilian women point with pride to their president , dil@@ ma r@@ ous@@ se@@ ff , but also under@@ score how much discrimin@@ ation remains .
in australia , with its robust wor@@ k-@@ life debate , women point to the success of julia g@@ ill@@ ard , the first woman prime minister , but note that she has no children ( nor does german chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a mer@@ kel , the first woman to lead her country ) .
the global nature of this debate demonstrates at least three important lessons .
first , if “ soft power ” means exercis@@ ing influence because “ others want what you want , ” as joseph n@@ ye puts it , then women the world over want what american femini@@ sts began fighting for three generations ago .
second , americans , not surprisingly , have much to learn from other countries ’ deb@@ ates , laws , and cultural norms .
after all , women have ascen@@ ded the political ladder faster in many other countries than they have in the us .
indeed , the us has never had a woman president , senate majority leader , secretary of the treas@@ ury , or secretary of defense .
finally , these are not “ women ’ s issues , ” but social and economic issues .
societies that discover how to use the education and talent of half their populations , while allowing women and their partners to invest in their families , will have a competitive edge in the global knowledge / innovation economy .
of course , hundreds of millions of women around the world can only wish that they had the problems about which i wrote .
those are just the most extreme cases of physical violence that many women face .
worldwide , more than a billion women confront grin@@ ding and over@@ t gender discrimin@@ ation in education , nutrition , health care , and sal@@ aries .
women ’ s rights are a global issue of the highest importance , and it is necessary to focus on the worst viol@@ ations .
still , consider a recent ma@@ tter-@@ of-@@ fact report from a so@@ ber and respected us magazine .
in an article on “ women in washington , ” the national journal observed that women in the us capital have come a long way , but “ still face career barriers , and often the biggest one is having a family . ”
if “ having a family ” is still a career barrier for women , but not for men , that , too , is a matter of women ’ s rights ( and thus of human rights ) .
in the global debate about work , family , and the promise of gender equality , no society is exem@@ pt .
what ’ s the beef in south korea ?
new york – at the out@@ set of the ongoing violent prote@@ sts in south korea over impor@@ ted beef from the united states , the entire cabinet of south korean president lee my@@ ung@@ -@@ ba@@ k offered to res@@ ign . last week , president lee fired three of them .
but beef , it turns out , represents just the tip of the iceberg of gri@@ ev@@ ances against president lee .
only four months in office , his approval rating is down to single digits .
lee won the december 2007 election with 4@@ 8.@@ 7 % of the vote , having run on the “ 747 ” platform , promising 7 % annual gdp growth , per capita income of $ 40,000 , and to make korea the world ’ s seventh largest economy ( up from 13@@ th currently ) .
so what went wrong ?
the economy is slowing – the bank of korea cut its growth forecast for this year to 4.@@ 7 % , while the oecd expe@@ cts only 4.@@ 3 % growth – inflation is rising , and some are concerned that lee ’ s policies are too ge@@ ared toward foreign investors and big business .
lee also must confront factors beyond his control , such as so@@ aring oil prices and the global credit crun@@ ch .
beyond the economy , lee has been faced with charges of ap@@ pointing officials with question@@ able ethics and of hea@@ v@@ y-@@ handed leadership ( his nick@@ name is “ bulldo@@ zer ” ) , which is reflected in efforts to push through a controversial cross-@@ country canal system and an un@@ popular proposal to priva@@ tize the healthcare system .
furthermore , lee ’ s hard-@@ line approach to north korea – very different from that of his pre@@ de@@ cess@@ ors – has resulted in a popular bac@@ klas@@ h .
to be sure , as north korea seemingly snu@@ b@@ bed the international community in recent years , there was consider@@ able popular dis@@ content with the previous two admini@@ strations ’ “ sunshine ” policy , which emphasi@@ zed peaceful cooperation prior to event@@ ual korean uni@@ fication .
but now , with the north ’ s destruction of key elements of its nuclear program , international negotiations appear to be bearing fruit , and lee ’ s tougher stance has gained less approval than might have been anticipated when he came to office .
the combined effect of these developments has been to ero@@ de lee ’ s reputation precipit@@ ously .
now , on top of everything , comes the beef controversy .
in april , on his first foreign trip following his in@@ augu@@ ration , lee traveled to the us .
on the eve of the visit , his government agreed to lift the five-@@ year-old ban on us beef impor@@ ts as part of efforts to improve bil@@ ateral ties following years of up@@ -and-@@ down relations during former president roh mo@@ o-@@ hy@@ un ’ s administration .
while most in the west applau@@ ded lee ’ s visit , the reaction in korea was significantly more negative .
many in korea viewed the beef decision as having been ha@@ sti@@ ly taken , and without appropriate consul@@ tation of all relevant parties .
in addition , significant se@@ gments of the population saw the agreement as lee selling out or ko@@ w@@ to@@ wing to the americans .
the public reaction began with a demonstration in seoul on may 2 in which hundreds of teenagers held a cand@@ le@@ light vi@@ gi@@ l .
soon , tens of thousands of kore@@ ans joined the prote@@ sts .
lee seems to have mis@@ jud@@ ged the strength of his election victory and the currents of opinion in several important ways .
given the nation@@ alist senti@@ ments motiv@@ ating the beef prote@@ sters , the strength of opposition forces , and widespread hosti@@ lity to opening and priva@@ tizing the south korean economy further , lee , whose authoritarian style of management reminds many of the era of military rule , will now need to move forward carefully .
lee must reach out to the opposition , both within his party and outside it , to build agreement or negotiate compromise on the con@@ ten@@ tious issues that his administration faces .
he must reach out to the people of korea and demonstrate that he is willing to listen to their concerns and act accor@@ d@@ ingly .
finally , he must act on his campaign promises to build a more prosper@@ ous and confident korea .
the upside of all this political tur@@ mo@@ il is that it demonstrates the vi@@ g@@ or of korean democracy .
lee ’ s task now is to discover how best to take advantage of this new political ac@@ tivism .
he has faced political adver@@ sity before , and he will again .
what ’ s wrong with ethnic profil@@ ing ?
brus@@ sels – several years ago , as terrorism , immigration , and un@@ rest in suburban paris were at the top of the news in france , a french police officer confi@@ ded to a researcher : “ if you consider different levels of trafficking , it is obviously done by blac@@ ks and arab@@ s .
if you are on the road and see a black man or a man with arabic features , you say to yourself , ‘ he doesn ’ t look french , ’ and then you might stop him to see if he has papers . ”
this police officer was describing a textbook example of “ ethnic profil@@ ing ” : law en@@ for@@ cement officials use of stereotypes , rather than specific information about behavior , in deciding to stop , search , or de@@ tain people .
ethnic profil@@ ing is illegal in europe .
it is in@@ effective in app@@ re@@ hen@@ ding criminals .
it is counter-@@ productive in the campaign against terrorism .
but police officers across europe continue to use it .
the in@@ efficiency of ethnic profil@@ ing was high@@ ligh@@ ted in early may , when the british government released figures showing that , of the more than 1@@ 17@@ ,000 police stops made between 2007 and 2008 , only 72 led to an arrest for terror@@ is@@ m-@@ related off@@ ences .
other major european countries do not collect data on police stops broken down according to the targets ’ ethnic or religious background .
but private research and anecdot@@ al reports provide a frighten@@ ingly similar picture .
a massive dat@@ a-@@ mining exercise in germany from 2001 to 2003 traw@@ led through personal information on 8.@@ 3 million people and failed to find a single terrorist .
separate studies in britain , the netherlands , sweden , and the united states have concluded that ethnic profil@@ ing wa@@ stes time and resources .
as a new report by the open society justice initiative shows , by targe@@ ting ethnic min@@ orities , police ali@@ en@@ ate some of the very people on whom they depend for cooperation and intelligence .
and by pre-@@ selec@@ ting fixed categories of people for hei@@ ghten@@ ed scru@@ tiny , the authorities over@@ look those who do not fit the profile .
a young spanish man who is a member of an ethnic minority group put it this way : “ i worry when i go on the street that the police will stop me and ask me for my papers because of the color of my skin , by my tone of skin , by my way of walking . ”
given its fail@@ ings , why is ethnic profil@@ ing so widespread ?
the answer is simple .
when the police use ethnic profil@@ ing , they project an image of being tough on crime and terrorism .
this appe@@ ases public opinion , which demands robust anti-@@ terrorism action .
following the september 2001 attacks in new york , and again after the bomb@@ ings in ma@@ dri@@ d in 2004 and london in 2005 , la@@ w-@@ en@@ for@@ cement authorities across europe launched mass-@@ arrest operations , under@@ took widespread surveillance of mosqu@@ es , carried out stops and searches of people who appeared to be muslim , and used other in@@ tru@@ sive measures that disrup@@ ted the lives of – and in many cases humili@@ ated – la@@ w-@@ ab@@ i@@ ding european citizens .
as public anxiety has ab@@ ated , and senior officials have felt less pressure to show that they are doing something , the most fla@@ grant ab@@ uses have declined .
but such practices are still being applied to a lesser degree , and they can be pulled out of the arsenal whenever political or social conditions dic@@ tate .
fortunately , some of europe ’ s leaders recognize the problem .
in late april , the european parliament issued a report high@@ lighting the danger that un@@ restricted data mining that reli@@ es on racial , ethnic , or national origin would subject innocent people to arbitrary stops , travel restri@@ ctions , and b@@ ans on employment or banking .
the report called for legislation to protect against ethnic profil@@ ing .
the solution is not to ignore the threat of terrorism , but to address the threat more intelli@@ gently .
over the past two years , a project that our organization under@@ took with police forces and ci@@ vil@@ -@@ society groups in hung@@ ary and spain found that , when stops were systematically monit@@ ored and data publicly reported , the proportion of stops that produced an arrest or other la@@ w-@@ en@@ for@@ cement outcome actually increased .
police work became more efficient .
this makes sense .
when officers are required to articulate grounds for suspi@@ cion , they are more likely to rely on behavioral factors rather than prejudice .
in the future , the european union and its member states should fund more collaboration between police and minority communities .
the eu should combat radi@@ c@@ alization by addressing exclu@@ sion , not by con@@ fl@@ ating conservative religious faith with terrorism .
and it should make clear that police may not use ethnic , racial , or religious stereotypes .
by treating people as suspicious purely because of who they are , how they look , or where they pray , rather than what they do or have done , ethnic profil@@ ing threat@@ ens the very e@@ thos of the eu , a union firmly rooted in values of liberty , democracy , and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .
what &apos;s wrong with europe &apos;s right ?
war@@ saw : everywhere in europe , traditional right wing parties are in crisis .
a civil war gri@@ ps the french right , with a euro mp grand@@ son of charles de gau@@ lle aband@@ oning the gau@@ lli@@ sts to join jean-@@ marie le pen &apos;s national front .
even germany &apos;s rock solid christian democrats are pois@@ ed over an aby@@ ss of sc@@ andal .
only the extreme right-@@ wing freedom party of austria &apos;s j@@ ör@@ g hai@@ der is on the march .
is europe &apos;s right do@@ omed to extinction or extremism ?
i am neither a man of the left , nor of the right .
still , the trou@@ bles of the right should worry all thinking democrats ; and these trou@@ bles are not confined to europe &apos;s western half .
two years ago i admi@@ red the profession@@ alism with which poland &apos;s and hung@@ ary &apos;s righ@@ tist parties came to power .
since then , like western europe &apos;s conservatives , they managed to – at least in political terms – bot@@ ch nearly everything .
both movements now gar@@ ner only around 20 % of support in opinion polls .
so-called post-@@ comm@@ uni@@ sts are flying high with around 70 % .
perhaps the collap@@ sing popul@@ arity of the right in our new democracies tells something about the right in europe &apos;s old democracies .
for like their western counter@@ parts , the polish and hungarian conservatives are caught between their increasingly un@@ appealing neo-@@ liber@@ alism and their increasingly an@@ ach@@ r@@ oni@@ stic commun@@ itarian traditions .
fi@@ des@@ z in hung@@ ary and the solidar@@ ity elec@@ toral alliance ( a@@ ws ) in poland gained power two years ago because of a reaction to their post-@@ communist pre@@ de@@ cess@@ ors .
during their ten@@ ures , neither post-@@ communist party ro@@ cked the reform boat very much , nor did they threaten democracy .
yet the voters were ready to move away from the old ties – the elec@@ tor@@ ate had become much younger in the 1990s and the improvements over the old regime , after the recession of the early 1990s had run its course and the reform policies began to pay off , became pal@@ pable .
in fact , people may have been somewhat ashamed at having allowed the post-@@ comm@@ uni@@ sts to win the second round of democratic elections in mid-@@ 1990s .
the right always saw the post-@@ communist inter@@ lu@@ de as a type of loc@@ ust years – a time when the seeds of reform with@@ ered .
so the righ@@ tist rhetoric har@@ den@@ ed .
no longer was it neo-@@ liberal .
what we heard was a robust form of christian conserva@@ tism un@@ heard since the days of de gau@@ lle , aden@@ au@@ er , and de gas@@ per@@ i – and the commun@@ itarian tone helped swe@@ ep the post-@@ comm@@ uni@@ sts away .
the right in poland and hung@@ ary used the commun@@ itarian rhetoric of christian conserva@@ tism , but once in power , they rever@@ ted to their original programs and governed like neo-@@ liberals .
the outcome was positive economically but a disaster politically .
for people ask : if growth is strong , why is unemployment high ?
why are state schools and health services so bad ?
why do we suddenly have an under@@ class of the kind we used to see in the american cities portra@@ yed in communist propaganda films ?
as the ri@@ g@@ ors of the transition continued , fa@@ ti@@ gue set it .
and that fa@@ ti@@ gue with liberal economics found resonance in our memories .
we remember something called &quot; solidar@@ ity , &quot; which promised that we were equal bre@@ thr@@ en ; that everyone would be taken care of .
the common good , civil society : all were to be nour@@ ished in our post-@@ communist democracies .
although few seriously question the free market economy and liberal individu@@ alism in man@@ ners and cust@@ oms , we feel un@@ easy about for@@ sa@@ king these values .
two years ago our new right governments promised to t@@ ame the col@@ dness of the market with the warmth of human understanding .
their warmth seemed nothing but political hot air .
the so-called left , both in poland and in hung@@ ary , has a language which ( coming from ex-@@ comm@@ uni@@ sts ) is breath@@ tak@@ ingly cy@@ ni@@ cal , yet effective .
it is a carbon copy of the language of the soci@@ al-@@ democrats who are so successful in western europe .
because our right-@@ lean@@ ing governments have been too decent to use the popu@@ list language of the radical right , they are helpless in appealing to mass emotions .
their words appear to have nothing to do with their dee@@ ds .
they talk of family , morality , nation , but their policies lead to nato , the european union , massive foreign investment , international capital , and globalization – all things that appear to under@@ mine the commun@@ itarian values of the right .
here our right confron@@ ts much the same dilemma as that facing the right in western europe – how to bridge the gulf between the market and the community .
unlike in the engli@@ sh-@@ speaking world , liber@@ alism has never been really popular on the european continent , and the conservatives have always appe@@ aled to the patri@@ otic and religious feelings of their suppor@@ ters .
the traditional right is therefore caught between a popu@@ list line that still appe@@ als to the voters and the liber@@ alizing policies that are the stuff of modern government everywhere .
the choice that the austri@@ an conservatives now face appears to confirm this stark dich@@ ot@@ omy .
in this light , hai@@ der may not be a historical le@@ f@@ to@@ ver somehow un@@ earth@@ ed in the mountains and val@@ leys of car@@ in@@ thia , but an aug@@ ury of the future of the right across the european continent .
there was much talk recently about the &quot; crisis of the left , &quot; as the labor party in britain , the soci@@ al-@@ democrats in germany , and the democrats in america had to struggle between their old soci@@ alist and new deal traditions and the imper@@ atives of a modern economy , with the fa@@ ding labor uni@@ ons and other political ba@@ sti@@ ons of the old left .
the left may have not found any real answers to its predi@@ cam@@ ents , but through a pragmatic pat@@ ch@@ work of policies and rhetoric it managed to reclaim the center stage .
all the while , the seemingly un@@ stopp@@ able march of the market , globalization , and individu@@ alism that had propelled the right since th@@ at@@ cher and reagan came to an ab@@ rupt halt .
and the commun@@ itarian traditions of the right , with their nation@@ alist past l@@ ur@@ king behind , may not be any easier to revi@@ tali@@ ze than the old fashioned soci@@ alism or new deal popu@@ li@@ sm .
what ’ s wrong with transformational leadership ?
cambridge – this year ’ s presidential campaign in the united states has been marked by calls from barack obama ’ s w@@ ou@@ l@@ d-@@ be republican challen@@ gers for a radical transformation of american foreign policy .
campaigns are always more extreme than the event@@ ual reality , but countries should be war@@ y of calls for transformational change .
things do not always work out as intended .
foreign policy played almost no role in the 2000 us presidential election .
in 2001 , george w. bush started his first term with little interest in foreign policy , but adopted transformational obje@@ ctives after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
like woo@@ dro@@ w wilson , franklin roosevelt , and harry tru@@ man before him , bush turned to the rhetoric of democracy to r@@ ally his followers in a time of crisis .
bill clinton had also talked about en@@ lar@@ ging the role of human rights and democracy in us foreign policy , but most americans in the 1990 ’ s sought normal@@ ity and a post-@@ cold war peace divi@@ dend rather than change .
by contrast , bush ’ s 2002 national security strategy , which came to be called the bush doctrine , pro@@ cla@@ imed that the us would “ identify and eliminate terrorists wherever they are , together with the regimes that sustain them . ”
the solution to the terrorist problem was to spread democracy everywhere .
bush invaded iraq o@@ sten@@ si@@ bly to remove saddam hussein ’ s capacity to use weapons of mass destruction and , in the process , to change the regime .
bush cannot be bl@@ amed for the intelligence failures that attribu@@ ted such weapons to saddam , given that many other countries shared such estimates .
but inadequate understanding of the ira@@ qi and regional context , together with poor planning and management , under@@ cut bush ’ s transformational obje@@ ctives .
although some of bush ’ s defen@@ ders try to credit him with the “ arab spring ” revolutions , the primary arab participants reject such arguments .
bush was described by the economist as “ obsessed by the idea of being a transformational president ; not just a stat@@ us-@@ quo operator like bill clinton . ”
th@@ en-@@ secretary of state con@@ do@@ le@@ e@@ zz@@ a rice pra@@ ised the virtues of “ transformational diplomacy . ”
but , while leadership the@@ ori@@ sts and edi@@ torial writers tend to think that transformational foreig@@ n-@@ policy officials are better in either ethics or effectiveness , the evidence does not support this view .
other leadership skills are more important than the usual distinction between transformational and “ trans@@ ac@@ tional ” leaders .
consider president george h@@ .@@ w. bush , who did not do “ the vision thing , ” but whose sound management and execution under@@ pinn@@ ed one of the most successful us foreig@@ n-@@ policy agen@@ das of the past half-@@ century .
perhaps genetic engineers will one day be able to produce leaders equally endo@@ wed with both vision and management skills ; comparing the two bus@@ hes ( who shared half their genes ) , it is clear that nature has not yet solved the problem .
this is not an argument against transformational leaders .
mo@@ han@@ das gandhi , nelson mandela , and martin luther king , jr . , played crucial roles in transforming people ’ s identity and aspirations .
nor is this an argument against transformational leaders in us foreign policy .
franklin roosevelt and tru@@ man made crucial contributions .
but , in jud@@ ging leaders , we need to pay attention to acts of both om@@ is@@ sion and commission , to what happened and to what was avoi@@ ded , to the dogs that bar@@ ked and to those that did not .
a big problem in foreign policy is the complexity of the context .
when we cannot be sure how to improve the world , p@@ ru@@ dence becomes an important virtue , and gran@@ dio@@ se visions can pose grave dangers .
in foreign policy , as in medicine , it is important to remember the hippo@@ cratic o@@ ath : first , do no harm .
for these reasons , the virtues of trans@@ ac@@ tional leaders with good contex@@ tual intelligence are very important .
someone like george h. w. bush , unable to articulate a vision but able to steer successfully through crises , turns out to be a better leader than someone like his son , poss@@ essed of a powerful vision but with little contex@@ tual intelligence or management skill .
former secretary of state george sh@@ ul@@ tz , who served under ronald reagan , once compared his role to gar@@ dening – “ the constant nurturing of a complex array of actors , interests , and goals . ”
but sh@@ ul@@ tz ’ s stanford colleague , con@@ do@@ le@@ e@@ zz@@ a rice , wanted a more transformational diplomacy that did not accept the world as it was , but tried to change it .
as one observer put it , “ rice ’ s ambition is not just to be a gar@@ dener – she wants to be a landscape architect . ” there is a role for both , depending on the context , but we should avoid the common mistake of automatically thinking that the transformational landscape architect is a better leader than the careful gar@@ dener .
we should keep this in mind as we ass@@ ess the current us presidential deb@@ ates , with their constant reference to american decline .
america is not in absolute decline , and , in relative terms , there is a reasonable probability that it will remain more powerful than any other country in the coming decades .
we do not live in a “ post-@@ american world , ” but we also do not live in the american era of the late twen@@ tieth century .
the us will be faced with a rise in the power resources of many others – both states and non-@@ state actors .
it will also confront a growing number of issues that require power with others as much as power over others in order to ob@@ tain the country ’ s preferred outcomes .
the problem of america ’ s role in the twenty-@@ first century is not one of ( poorly speci@@ fied ) “ decline , ” but rather of developing the contex@@ tual intelligence to understand that even the largest country cannot achieve what it wants without others ’ help .
educating the public to understand this complex globalized information age , and what is required to operate successfully in it , will be the real transformational leadership task .
thus far , we are not hearing much about it from the republican candidates .
what ’ s wrong with turkey ?
on december 16 , or@@ han pam@@ uk , one of turkey ’ s most famous writers , will enter an istanbul court to face a charge of “ insul@@ ting the national identity ” after he advoc@@ ated open discussion of the turkish genocide of 1.5 million ar@@ men@@ ians in 19@@ 15 and 19@@ 16 .
pam@@ uk faces three years in prison .
turkey ’ s effort to fine and im@@ prison those who do not to@@ e the official line convin@@ ces me that i was correct to op@@ pose opening negotiations on the country ’ s european union mem@@ ber@@ ship .
in december 1999 , the european council granted turkey the status of eu candi@@ dat@@ e-@@ member , im@@ plying that turkey would ac@@ ce@@ de to the union at some future , un@@ speci@@ fied date .
the council subsequently asked the european commission to decide by october 2004 whether turkey had suffici@@ ently fulfilled the political criteria – including democracy , the rule of law , and respect for the rights of ethnic min@@ orities – for mem@@ ber@@ ship .
that decision was one of the last taken by roman@@ o pro@@ di ’ s commission , of which i was a member .
of its 30 members , 29 said that turkey had fulfilled the criteria suffici@@ ently to proceed .
i was the lone dis@@ sent@@ er .
the commission ’ s own report on turkey , prepared by gün@@ ter ver@@ heu@@ gen , who was then in charge of eu en@@ lar@@ gement , shaped my decision .
this report mentioned that in 2003 some 2@@ 1,@@ 8@@ 70 tur@@ ks submitted asyl@@ um claims in the eu , of which 2,@@ 12@@ 7 were accepted .
in other words , the eu ’ s own governments acknowled@@ ged in 2003 that the turkish government had per@@ secu@@ ted more than 2,000 of its own citizens .
meanwhile , the commission published a progress report on turkey that granted that reforms were continuing , alb@@ eit at a slower pace , under prime minister re@@ ce@@ p ta@@ y@@ yi@@ p er@@ do@@ gan ’ s mil@@ dly islam@@ ic@@ -@@ minded government .
yet the report also presented serious mis@@ gi@@ v@@ ings : human rights viol@@ ations , including torture , continued ; the military ’ s influence remained too high ; freedom of speech was not univers@@ ally observed ; non-@@ muslim religious and cultural min@@ orities faced discrimin@@ ation ; and violence against women was not opposed strongly enough .
not much has changed since acc@@ ession talks began this october .
beyond the current per@@ secu@@ tion of pam@@ uk , unacceptable behavior abo@@ unds .
in march 2005 , the police viol@@ ently disrup@@ ted a demonstration to celebrate international women ’ s day .
in may , the largest teachers ’ union was banned for promoting the education of turkey ’ s 14 million kur@@ ds in their own language .
indeed , in@@ tolerance goes right to the top of the turkish government .
foreign minister ab@@ dul@@ la@@ h gü@@ l ab@@ rup@@ tly can@@ cell@@ ed a recent press conference in copenhagen when he spi@@ ed a kur@@ dish journalist in the audience and the dan@@ es refused to evi@@ ct him .
such actions and attitudes am@@ ply justify my dis@@ sent of october 2004 .
but , even if these short@@ com@@ ings were removed , turkey should still not be ad@@ mitted to the eu , because it is not a european country .
christi@@ an@@ ity , feu@@ d@@ alism , the renaissance , the enlightenment , democracy , and industri@@ alization have made us what we europeans are , but they have not made tur@@ ks who they are .
so i am not convinced that reforms in turkey implemented at the insi@@ stence of the european commission would continue after acc@@ ession .
indeed , i suspect that there will be back@@ sli@@ ding .
moreover , turkey ’ s acc@@ ession would lead inevitably to that of ukra@@ ine , bel@@ ar@@ us , and mol@@ do@@ va , and perhaps of georgia , ar@@ men@@ ia , and a@@ zer@@ ba@@ ï@@ d@@ jan .
the first three of these countries are certainly more european than turkey .
leaving the three cau@@ casi@@ an republi@@ cs aside but including the success@@ or states to yu@@ gosla@@ via , this would mean an eu of some 35 members .
what sort of union would that be ?
the eu is not simply a club of friends .
it is based on freedom of movement of goods , services , capital , and people .
the commission , as the guardian of the union ’ s treaties , must protect these four fundamental freedoms , which means that it must sometimes persuade , and if necessary force , member states to change their laws .
alcohol policy in sweden , the volk@@ swa@@ gen-@@ law in germany , and discrimin@@ ation against foreign investment funds in france are examples of cases that made the commission un@@ popular .
but they were necessary .
by the time i left the commission , i was sitting on a pile of 1,500 such infr@@ in@@ gement proce@@ ed@@ ings .
in short , eu mem@@ ber@@ ship ent@@ a@@ ils having to accept inc@@ isi@@ ve measures that deeply affect a state ’ s internal affairs .
that will be impossible with such disparate members .
the eu would fall victim to what the historian paul kennedy calls “ imperial over@@ reach . ”
the eu would become un@@ accep@@ tably di@@ lu@@ ted .
that is why former french president val@@ é@@ ry g@@ is@@ card d ’ e@@ sta@@ ing fe@@ ared that turkey ’ s entry would lead to the eu ’ s break@@ up , and it is why former german chan@@ cell@@ or hel@@ mut sch@@ mid@@ t said , “ acc@@ ession of turkey would be more than the eu could bear . ”
but the strongest reason to op@@ pose turkey ’ s acc@@ ession is a question of democracy : a majority of the eu ’ s population simply does not want it .
tin@@ ker , tail@@ or , snow@@ den , sp@@ y ?
moscow – a worldwide media fren@@ zy has turned the p@@ light of the ro@@ gue american intelligence analyst edward snow@@ den into something resem@@ bling a john le car@@ r@@ é novel , full of suspen@@ se and intri@@ gue .
whose sp@@ y is he ?
who will grant him asyl@@ um ?
will he be able to out@@ maneu@@ ver the national security agency as it attempts to force him to return to the united states to stand trial on charges of theft and es@@ pi@@ on@@ age ?
and what will us president barack obama say to his russian counter@@ part , v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin , at their scheduled meeting in moscow – where snow@@ den is currently taking refu@@ ge at sher@@ e@@ met@@ ye@@ vo airport – this september ?
the real es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , however , lies not in snow@@ den ’ s decision to release n@@ sa secrets , but in the surveillance programs that he exposed .
the le@@ aked information high@@ ligh@@ ted the west ’ s long-@@ ignored failure to strike an informed balance between security and liberty .
current political and economic uncertainty has exac@@ erb@@ ated the situation , driving policymakers to settle on simplistic solutions that , as snow@@ den made star@@ k@@ ly apparent , can under@@ mine the values that the west es@@ po@@ uses .
this is not true only in the us and the united kingdom , which happen to be ent@@ an@@ gled in the snow@@ den sc@@ andal .
the reluctant responses by germany and france to evidence that the n@@ sa has been conducting unprecedented surveillance of their officials indicate that europe ’ s governments may also be involved .
indeed , it now appears that america has shared its intelligence tro@@ ve with germany ’ s sp@@ y services when needed .
so far , obama ’ s handling of the snow@@ den aff@@ air shows that he places more stock in the logic of security than in ad@@ her@@ ence to principle .
coming from a president who won global sympathy – and a nobel peace prize – for his moral stance , the claim that the n@@ sa ’ s activities are justi@@ fied because “ that ’ s how intelligence services operate ” is particularly disap@@ pointing .
a state that emphasi@@ zes security over civil rights and liber@@ ties is easily hi@@ jac@@ ked by security agencies .
while america ’ s “ war on terror ” demands a stronger emphasis on security , the n@@ sa ’ s activities expose an alarming willingness to viol@@ ate the privacy of millions of individuals – including in al@@ lied countries , whose constitu@@ tions and sovereig@@ n@@ ty have also been bre@@ ached .
western leaders must now ask themselves whether the ends justify the means .
with the all-@@ powerful us training its si@@ ghts on a young former analyst , the answer appears to be no .
the current sc@@ andal ’ s impact on obama ’ s image increasingly resem@@ bles the impact of the water@@ gate sc@@ andal on president richard nixon ’ s standing in the 1970 ’ s – only now the events are playing themselves out on a global stage .
but obama is not really the problem ; at the heart of the issue is a model of liberal democracy that fails to respond to challenges that contradi@@ ct the values it is supposed to uph@@ old .
in fact , snow@@ den ’ s warning that “ any n@@ sa analyst , at any time , can target anyone , from a federal judge to the president ” suggests that n@@ sa head keith alexander – du@@ b@@ bed “ emper@@ or alexander ” – could already be more powerful than obama .
monitoring individuals ’ private lives is not limited to the state and its security services .
major global tele@@ communication companies – such as google , microsoft , facebook , and skype – have assembled secret stock@@ piles of personal information about their users , which they share with the n@@ sa .
beyond the obvious viol@@ ation of individuals ’ privacy impli@@ ed by such activities lies the danger that these firms will later make a deal with authoritarian regimes in russia or china , where little , if any , effort is made to preserve even the illusion of privacy .
google already has some experience in turning over information to china ’ s security services .
against this background , it is impossible to know whether these companies are already sp@@ ying on western leaders , together with the n@@ sa .
snow@@ den ’ s presence in russia , even in the airport ’ s international transit zone , has given the us a pre@@ text to de@@ clare that he is not a whist@@ leblo@@ wer , but a tra@@ it@@ or .
the fact that snow@@ den has now applied for temporary asyl@@ um in russia has rein@@ forced that interpretation .
ironically , by turning the aff@@ air into a sp@@ y thri@@ ll@@ er , pu@@ tin has helped the us to sal@@ vage its reputation – or at least to defle@@ ct some of the attention from the n@@ sa ’ s surveillance programs .
the discussion about security , privacy , and freedom that the snow@@ den drama has spar@@ ked is long over@@ due .
but the sc@@ andal has beg@@ ot@@ ten many los@@ ers .
snow@@ den has effectively given up his future .
the us and obama have lost their claim to the moral high ground .
and liberal democracies ’ apparent inability to protect their citizens from infr@@ in@@ gement of their individual rights has under@@ min@@ ed their standing at home and abroad .
russian society will also pay a price , with the n@@ sa ’ s surveillance programs giving the kre@@ m@@ lin amm@@ uni@@ tion to defend the expansion of state control over the internet and other aspects of citizens ’ personal lives .
similarly , the sc@@ andal will likely inspire china to streng@@ then its great fire@@ wall further .
the or@@ deal ’ s only vic@@ tor is pu@@ tin , who now has grounds to dis@@ miss us criticism of his authoritarian rule .
indeed , at the sli@@ ghtest pro@@ voc@@ ation , pu@@ tin will be able to point to america ’ s hypo@@ cris@@ y for sp@@ ying on , say , european union facilities as part of expanded surveillance programs supposedly within the scope of the war on terror , and for hunting snow@@ den after acc@@ using russia of un@@ fairly pro@@ secu@@ ting the whist@@ leblo@@ wer serge@@ i magni@@ t@@ sky .
snow@@ den did not create the se@@ curi@@ ty-@@ privacy dilemma , but he did illumin@@ ate a deeply rooted problem that western leaders have long tried to obscure .
one can only hope that his actions , and the resul@@ ting sc@@ andal , will compe@@ l western leaders to reas@@ s@@ ess their approach to national security – and not simply lead them to try to conce@@ al it better .
what the west can do
t@@ bili@@ si – given the tremendous damage that russia has in@@ fli@@ cted on georgia , it is easy to conclude that the kre@@ m@@ lin has achieved its obje@@ ctives .
but , so far , russia has failed in its real goal – getting rid of mik@@ hei@@ l sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i , georgia ’ s pro-@@ democracy , pro-@@ american president .
to be sure , russia has ti@@ ghten@@ ed its control of the se@@ para@@ tist en@@ cla@@ ves of south os@@ se@@ tia and ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zi@@ a . it shat@@ tered the geor@@ gian military , gri@@ ev@@ ously damaged georgia ’ s economy , and stir@@ red up dis@@ cord within the western alliance .
for three years , it has tried every concei@@ vable tac@@ tic to bring sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i down – f@@ om@@ enting a domestic u@@ prising , im@@ posing an economic block@@ ade , be@@ ef@@ ing up its forces in the en@@ cla@@ ves , and finally a war .
yet georgia ’ s president remains in power .
here in t@@ bili@@ si , tension is understand@@ ably high .
russian tanks are less than 25 miles away , and the wheat fields along the main road to gor@@ i were ab@@ la@@ ze , set on fire by russian troops , as i drove through russian check@@ points to get to that deser@@ ted , occupied city .
( most memorable sight : dr@@ unken russian soldiers in stolen geor@@ gian uni@@ forms – “ because they are better than ours . ” )
russia ’ s invasion of georgia has res@@ ha@@ ped the strategic landscape .
but , as the west deb@@ ates how to “ punish russia , ” it is vital to remember that the main front is still in georgia .
talk about taking away the 20@@ 14 winter olympics or e@@ je@@ cting russia from the g-@@ 8 may ( or may not ) have some effect on the kre@@ m@@ lin , but the most important thing the west can do now is streng@@ then the government in t@@ bili@@ si .
the equation is simple : if sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i survi@@ ves , v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin loses .
the intense personal hatred between these men over@@ lays two centuries of tortured history between russia and georgia .
many people report that pu@@ tin simply “ loses it ” when discussing the up@@ start sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i , who led his country from near bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy into a golden age of economic growth and the world ’ s highest rate of foreign direct investment relative to gdp .
all this has been hal@@ ted by russian tanks .
the kre@@ m@@ lin has probably lost its chance to remove sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i by over@@ t force , although sin@@ ister , more ste@@ al@@ thy means cannot be ruled out .
having just din@@ ed with him in a public restaurant , i wish his security was a little ti@@ ghter .
( his pre@@ de@@ cess@@ or , edu@@ ard she@@ var@@ d@@ na@@ d@@ ze , was a near-@@ miss target for several ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation attempts that are widely believed to have been russi@@ an-@@ directed . ) the kre@@ m@@ lin ’ s best hope now is that georgia ’ s economy will cru@@ mble , its currency will collapse , and an unhappy popul@@ ace , encouraged by some opposition leader ( perhaps bank@@ rolled by russia ) , will force sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i from power .
the western response to this challenge must go beyond rhetoric .
what matters most right now is massive economic and military assistance .
public commit@@ ments to help rebuild georgia are the best way to prevent russia from achieving its goal .
prime minister v@@ la@@ di@@ mir gur@@ geni@@ d@@ ze estimates that rebuilding rail@@ roads , bridges , ports and other infrastructure will cost at least $ 1 billion ; this does not include humanitarian relief , refugee res@@ et@@ t@@ lement costs , or rebuilding georgia ’ s military .
gur@@ geni@@ d@@ ze also fores@@ e@@ es negative economic growth , a huge budget deficit , and a collapse of tourism , which was just taking off in this beautiful country .
united states senator joseph bi@@ den has called for an immediate $ 1 billion supp@@ le@@ mental appropri@@ ation , a proposal quickly end@@ or@@ sed by barack obama .
but the bush administration has not yet been specific on economic support .
congress will be in session only briefly before the election , and a supp@@ le@@ mental appropri@@ ation will pass only if president bush pursu@@ es it vi@@ gor@@ ously as a bi@@ partisan measure .
even if del@@ a@@ yed until next year , its immediate proposal by bush and end@@ or@@ se@@ ment by both presidential candidates would help mor@@ ale in georgia .
the european union , the world bank , the international mon@@ etary fund , and the european bank for reconstruction and development must match american support .
in the long run , georgia and russia must co@@ exist peac@@ efully .
here , georgia must do its part .
sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i , an immensely talented 4@@ 1@@ -year-old , saved his country from utter collapse in 2003 . but he must think strategi@@ cally about the future .
on occasion , he has ber@@ ated the europeans for in@@ sufficient support – not a good tac@@ tic for someone trying to join the eu – and has used rhetoric about russia that , while understandable , only increases the danger to himself .
sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i cannot pick up his tiny country and move it to mexico .
he has to manage the situation with greater care .
there will be consequences , of course , for russia ’ s relations with the west .
( bush ’ s in@@ atten@@ tiveness to this russian threat – dramatically illu@@ strated by his literal embrace of pu@@ tin in beijing as russian tanks rolled into georgia – may have led the kre@@ m@@ lin to think it could get away with its invasion . )
while the west will not going to war over georgia , russia must understand that it will pay for using force , or the threat of force , against neighbors that were once part of the soviet space .
this is especially true for ukra@@ ine and a@@ zer@@ bai@@ jan , which are likely to be moscow ’ s next targets for intimi@@ dation .
the rules of the post-@@ cold war world are changing – but not to the ultimate benefit of russia , which has under@@ estimated the uni@@ fying effect its actions will have on the west .
exactly how these relationships evolve depends on what each side does in the coming weeks – especially in georgia .
what threat@@ ens russia ?
it is fashi@@ on@@ able in russia to dispar@@ age our fundamental shift in foreign policy that followed the terrorist attacks on the us last year .
according to this view , russia sold its loyalty to the us-@@ led anti-@@ terror coalition too cheap@@ ly .
in exchange for more bil@@ ateral and multi@@ lat@@ eral finan@@ cing , russia now faces growing us military bases on its southern flan@@ k in central asia and the cau@@ cas@@ us , while nato is pois@@ ed to expand right up to our western border .
but however justi@@ fied criticism of growing us un@@ il@@ ater@@ alism may be-@@ -@@ in the so-called war on terrorism and else@@ wher@@ e-@@ -@@ the gra@@ v@@ est risks facing russia lie elsewhere .
the first concerns the most basic interest of any state : defense of its terri@@ torial integrity .
here the most immediate threat is not posed by america or nato , but by the european union , whose en@@ lar@@ gement means that member states will soon surround russia &apos;s kal@@ in@@ ing@@ rad region on all sides .
russia &apos;s task is to ensure that this does not im@@ pe@@ de the free movement of people and goods between kal@@ in@@ ing@@ rad and the rest of the country .
this is a vital condition for keeping the region russian , and special eu transit vis@@ as should therefore be granted to kal@@ in@@ ing@@ rad &apos;s residents in order to ensure simpli@@ fied travel through adjacent eu countries .
the eu , however , does not want to give kal@@ in@@ ing@@ rad &apos;s citizens such rights .
a solution must be found , not least because the eu &apos;s attitude to the kal@@ in@@ ing@@ rad problem will be a lit@@ mus test of its desire for broader rap@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement with russia .
our mistake was to bro@@ ach the subject of &quot; corrid@@ ors &quot; linking kal@@ in@@ ing@@ rad with the rest of russia .
poland immediately associated the idea with the pre-@@ war dan@@ zig ( g@@ dan@@ sk ) corrid@@ or and interpreted it as an ex-@@ terri@@ torial en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ment on polish sovereig@@ n@@ ty .
but this is not so .
we are talking about transport rou@@ tes for people and goods , nothing more .
common sense should pre@@ va@@ il .
the second risk facing russia is no less daunting .
o@@ wing to a steep@@ ly declining birth rate and falling life expec@@ tan@@ cy@@ -@@ -@@ largely the result of poor diet , widespread smoking , and alcohol ab@@ use@@ -@@ -@@ russia &apos;s population is contra@@ cting by nearly a million people per year .
little , if anything , is being done to stem the demographic crisis , and it cannot be resolved by a higher birth rate alone ( although this is obviously an important factor ) .
moreover , the crisis is ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ated by the un@@ even distribution of the population throughout russia , with a near vacuum in the far east and siberia .
a vacuum never survi@@ ves for long .
but can russia manage to per@@ mit controlled and measured immigration ?
after all , the us gets a million new citizens annu@@ ally from latin america , mostly mexico , and the italian population grows annu@@ ally by 9@@ 0,000 africans .
the difference is literally one of degrees - educational degrees .
when a well-@@ educated , skilled foreig@@ ner e@@ migr@@ ates to the us , he or she can hope to ob@@ tain citizenship relatively soon .
foreig@@ ners with less developed skills , on the other hand , must work di@@ li@@ gently for several years to ob@@ tain permanent residen@@ cy .
in russia , we lack any such gra@@ dation .
so we need to formu@@ late , jo@@ in@@ tly with neighbor@@ ing countries , a legal framework for immigration .
our policy should be explicitly designed to foster a more developed economic and social infrastructure in eastern russia .
currently , those who want to settle in russia emi@@ gra@@ te overwhel@@ m@@ ingly from the c@@ is countries , and 99 % of them settle in european russia .
unless we equ@@ alize conditions throughout the country , the already profound regional dispar@@ ities will wor@@ sen .
this will require that we accept not only ex-@@ soviet citizens but also chinese and korean immigr@@ ants .
the third challenge that russia fac@@ es-@@ -@@ one related to addressing its demographic cris@@ is-@@ -@@ is the need to diversi@@ fy investment to ensure more even economic development , both geographi@@ cally and by sector .
capital that has accum@@ ulated in the raw materials sector in recent years should be shifted to manufacturing and infrastructure .
currently , only oil production and export benefit from capital accumulation , whereas large sums are simply being sent out of the country .
president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin recently hin@@ ted that russians with cash in offshore accounts may find their funds frozen pen@@ ding audi@@ ts of money suspected of assi@@ sting terrorist groups .
while russia itself will not freeze accounts , president pu@@ tin &apos;s meaning was clear : it would be better for all sides if this money were brought home and invested in the national economy .
to achieve this end , russia must create a secure and attractive investment climate .
most importantly , if we are to reverse capital flight , the government must persuade individual sa@@ vers that they can depos@@ it money safely and with@@ draw it on demand .
how can the government expect to mobili@@ ze domestic investment as long as ordinary russians keep their sav@@ ings@@ -- $ 50 billion , according to most esti@@ mat@@ es-@@ -@@ at home ?
russia &apos;s people need to be convinced of the country &apos;s political stabili@@ ty-@@ -@@ that , for example , nobody will suggest nation@@ alization , as happened repeatedly during the eight months that i was prime minister .
the model of soci@@ alism that existed in the soviet union is dead ; even the communist party does not seriously question the need for market economic relations .
but the manner in which the market is established and operates is another matter .
unfortunately , central planning was not the only way to deep@@ en russia &apos;s back@@ war@@ dness relative to the west .
what to expect from the 4@@ 4@@ th president
new york – campaigns , be they political or military , are wa@@ ged to be won , and the current american presidential campaign is no exception .
the democratic and republican candidates are doing all they can to distinguish themselves from an un@@ popular in@@ cum@@ bent president and from one another in the remaining weeks before americans vote .
for good reason , much attention is focused on foreign policy differences between the two nom@@ ine@@ es , which in many areas are both obvious and consider@@ able .
still , it is possible to disc@@ ern some similarities between them , in part because some of their dis@@ agre@@ ements are not as pronoun@@ ced as they seem , and in part because the constraints that the next president of the united states will face are certain to limit what either man could do in office .
consider iraq , the most di@@ visi@@ ve issue in american politics for the past five years .
barack obama regularly points out that the decision to go to war was deeply fla@@ wed ; john mccain emphasi@@ zes how much things have turned around since early 2007 , when us tro@@ op numbers were increased and us strategy re@@ vised .
obser@@ vers could be for@@ given for thinking that they are speaking about two entirely different conflicts .
but what about the future ?
no matter who wins this november , it is clear that iraq will not dominate us foreign policy in the years ahead to anything near the degree that it has in recent years .
we are entering the post-@@ iraq era of american foreign policy .
where the two candidates differ is on the timing and pace of this dra@@ w@@ down , not on its general direction .
by contrast , the us commitment to afghanistan will increase , and tro@@ op levels will climb .
behind this prediction is a widely shared assessment that the trends in afghanistan ( unlike in iraq ) are negative , and that the us must streng@@ then its military presence there and re@@ v@@ ise its strategy if the taliban are not to gain the upper hand .
it is also widely understood that pakistan has become part of the problem .
pakistan ’ s western reaches are now a sanctu@@ ary for mili@@ ti@@ as and terrorists that are moving in and out of afghanistan .
here , barack obama appears more willing to have the us launch un@@ il@@ ateral military ra@@ ids against terrorists should the opportunity arise .
but whoever is elected will confront difficult choices if a nu@@ clear@@ -@@ armed pakistan remains unable or un@@ willing to act as an american partner and meet its responsibilities in the effort against terrorism .
a third area of some consensus ( and some distance from george w. bush ) is climate change .
under the next president , the us will no longer be a drag on international efforts to create a global regime that sets a ceiling on greenhouse gas emissions .
one result of this likely evolution in us policy is that pressure will shift to other countries , particularly china and india , to accept some limits on their own economic behavior .
a president mccain or obama will take steps to improve america ’ s image in the world .
one of his first decisions will be to implement a ban on all forms of torture .
also to be expected early on is a decision to close the facility at gu@@ ant@@ á@@ nam@@ o bay , where terrorism suspe@@ cts have been held for years without trial .
iran is another area where the differences – at least initially – may not be as sharp as the campaign suggests .
both candidates have stressed that an iran with nuclear weapons would be unacceptable .
the vic@@ tor will almost surely end@@ or@@ se a new diplo@@ matic initiative aimed at ending iran ’ s independent ability to en@@ rich uranium .
less clear are the details of such an initiative , or what the us would do if it were to fail .
the candidates ’ statements on iran do suggest two different philosophi@@ es of diplomacy .
obama seems to regard meeting with foreign leaders as a normal component of foreign policy , to be employed as one of many tools .
mccain appears to embrace the view that such meetings are something of a reward , to be offered when pre@@ conditions are met ( iran comes to mind ) and with@@ drawn when certain lines are crossed , as russia was jud@@ ged to have done this august in georgia .
despite such differences , either would carry out policies closer to those of bush ’ s second term than his first .
with a stra@@ ined military and a struggling economy , the next president will often have little choice other than to talk .
on other issues , such as trade , there are distin@@ ctions between the candidates .
mccain is a stronger advocate of free trade than obama is .
but this difference may have less impact than meets the eye .
congress plays a large role in trade policy , and the near certainty that the democratic party ’ s majority in congress will grow after the election means that prote@@ c@@ tion@@ ism will grow as well .
difficult economic times will make it hard to generate support for trade pac@@ ts , despite the current importance of ex@@ port-@@ oriented firms for the american economy .
there are real and important differences between the two candidates when it comes to how they would approach the world .
but there are also more similarities than might be evident from the deb@@ ates and the campaign .
aspects of the next president ’ s foreign policy are there to see if obser@@ vers read between the lines and take as much note of what is not said as what is .
what went wrong in argentina ?
as argentina &apos;s economy un@@ ra@@ vels in street demon@@ strations , food riots , and political tu@@ mul@@ t , conventional wisdom suggests that a lethal combination of reck@@ less government spending and a fixed exchange rate is to blame .
large fiscal defic@@ its , so this argument goes , pump@@ ed up domestic demand , which fu@@ eled inflation and caused the pes@@ o to appreciate in real terms , even though it was pe@@ gged to the us dollar at a nomin@@ al one-@@ to-one exchange rate .
as public debt grew , the government &apos;s only hope of paying it back was a de@@ fla@@ tionary cl@@ am@@ p@@ down on available money and credi@@ t-@@ -@@ with a collapse in output , so@@ aring unemployment , and civil disorder almost inevitable .
this line of reasoning is plau@@ sible , because exchange rate mis@@ alig@@ nment may indeed be at the heart of argentina &apos;s problems ( alb@@ eit for very different reasons that we will not explore here , one associated with a sudden stop in capital flows ) .
but fiscal pro@@ fli@@ g@@ acy alone cannot explain argentina &apos;s mel@@ t@@ down .
throughout the 1990s , argentina &apos;s budget deficit never exce@@ eded 2 % of gdp , with the exception of 1999 , when it rose to 2.5 % , before falling back to 2.@@ 4 % in 2000 .
while publi@@ c-@@ sector borrowing pushed external debt from 2@@ 8.@@ 4 % of gdp in 1991 to 5@@ 1.@@ 4 % in 2000 , this still compar@@ es favor@@ ably with countries ren@@ owned for their fiscal prob@@ ity .
the european union , for example , requires its member states to cap budget defic@@ its and public debt , respe@@ ctively , at 3 % and 60 % of gdp .
moreover , like argentina &apos;s dollar peg , most eu countries abandoned control over their exchange rates by adopting the euro .
yet no one suggests that germany , france , or italy risk sharing argentina &apos;s fate .
one key difference between argentina and the eu is the huge risk premi@@ um that argentina must pay for its debt , which im@@ poses much nar@@ ro@@ wer limits on the sustainability of its fiscal defic@@ its .
indeed , in 2000 , interest payments on the public debt equ@@ aled 16@@ .@@ 5 % of argentina &apos;s total budget revenues .
why , then , was argentina treated so differently in 2001 ?
something essential is missing from the conventional story : money and banking .
like other emerging market economies , liber@@ alizing reforms in the early 1990s attracted massive in@@ flows of foreign credit .
but after robust economic growth in 199@@ 1-@@ 94 , argentina was hit by the mexican crisis , which produced capital flight , a run on bank depos@@ its , and a severe , but short-@@ lived , recession .
argentina &apos;s main response - encouraging large-scale foreign investment in the banking sector - sought to ensure that this would not happen again , given that there would now be an international len@@ der of last resort .
with confidence restored , real gdp growth re@@ bo@@ unded strongly , reaching 8.@@ 1 % in 1997 .
with a largely foreig@@ n-@@ owned - and thus well-@@ capit@@ alized - banking sector , argentina remained insul@@ ated from the sudden rever@@ s@@ als of capital flows that fu@@ eled crises in emerging markets after 1997 .
but soon after taking the helm at the economics ministry in march 2001 , dom@@ ingo cav@@ all@@ o pointed an acc@@ using finger at the central bank .
not@@ with@@ standing the fixed exchange rate , which limited mon@@ etary growth to that of the bank &apos;s dollar reserves , he argued that economic recovery required an expan@@ sion@@ ary credit policy .
the standard view among economists is that relax@@ ing mon@@ etary policy under a fixed exchange rate regime will cause capital to fle@@ e , especially when investors are already j@@ it@@ tery about the effects of a de@@ valu@@ ation in a largely doll@@ arized economy , which typically involves a bank bail@@ out and a loss in reserves to pay for it .
pe@@ dr@@ o po@@ u , argentina &apos;s central bank president and a strong defen@@ der of the standard view , was sac@@ ked , and the bank increased credit shar@@ ply .
unfortunately , the conventional view was right .
by december 2001 , international reserves fell to less than half their january level , with credit expansion accounting for about 53 % of the loss . ( meanwhile , the spread on government bonds jumped from 9@@ 73 to 4@@ 4@@ 35 points ) .
the rest was due to an 18 % decline in depos@@ its , with the loss of confidence mainly hitting state-@@ owned banks .
since their depos@@ its far exce@@ eded argentina &apos;s international reserves , the central bank &apos;s decision to pro@@ p up their reserves with fresh inje@@ ctions of credit rein@@ forced expectations that the fixed exchange rate was do@@ omed .
worse still , in order to compen@@ sa@@ te for the credit expen@@ ded on intervention , the mon@@ etary authorities hi@@ ked the banks &apos; reserve requirements for new depos@@ its , a measure that affected mostly foreign banks who were receiving depos@@ its escap@@ ing from public banks .
therefore , foreign banks , fear@@ ful of further intervention and / or con@@ fis@@ cation , refused to re@@ plen@@ ish their local subsidi@@ aries &apos; reserves ( thus , the answer to the question , why didn &apos;t foreign banks act as a len@@ der of last resort ? ) .
this destroyed what little confidence in the banking system remained .
as foreign reserves continued to plum@@ met , the pes@@ o &apos;s de@@ valu@@ ation became inevitable .
would argentina be better off had it flo@@ ated the pes@@ o long before all this ?
such a move might have prevented the pes@@ o from becoming so over@@ valued that investors lost confidence in the country &apos;s ability to pay its deb@@ ts .
but without a credible mon@@ etary policy , floating the currency would have merely sto@@ ked hyper@@ inflation .
so the key lesson here is that the type of exchange rate regime is secondary to the credi@@ bility required to sustain it .
clearly , hetero@@ do@@ x mon@@ etary policy was far from credible , and it turned out to be the main cul@@ pr@@ it behind argentina &apos;s final collapse .

what went wrong with america
the latest edi@@ tion of the pe@@ w global attitudes survey shows that favor@@ able opinions of the united states have fallen again in 12 out of 15 countries poll@@ ed , a sad reflection of a country ’ s loss of image .
how can america recover international legiti@@ macy ?
this is probably one of the most important challenges for today ’ s world , for america re@@ tains a unique power that should be used – and be perceived – as a force for good if global stability is to pre@@ va@@ il .
nearly two decades after the de@@ mise of the soviet empire , what stands out is a prevail@@ ing sense of lost opportunities .
the us had a unique opportunity at the end of the cold war to use its ben@@ evol@@ ent and enlightened super@@ i@@ ority to establish a better international order .
but , for a combination of political and personal reasons , america lost time under the two pres@@ iden@@ cies of bill clinton .
indeed , during this necessarily short and fragile “ uni@@ polar moment , ” clinton probably had an intuition of what america ’ s new responsibilities should be , but he did not deliver .
the defeat of the democrats in the mid-@@ term elections in 1994 , followed by the mon@@ ica le@@ win@@ sky aff@@ air , ham@@ per@@ ed the effectiveness of one of america ’ s most energetic and gifted presidents .
that failure was epit@@ om@@ ized by the inability to impose a peace agreement on palestini@@ ans and israelis in 2000 .
by contrast , george w. bush did not lose time .
he did worse : he simply took a wrong turn – and he took it before 9 / 11 , a traumatic event that rein@@ forced , but did not create , america ’ s mani@@ che@@ an view of itself and its role in the world .
three recent examples illustrate what went wrong with america , its loss of unique status , and its growing image as a partisan and un@@ ethical , if not dest@@ abili@@ zing , force in the world .
consider , first , the recent nuclear agreement signed between the us and india .
in strictly legal terms , there is nothing wrong , since india never signed the nuclear non-@@ proliferation treaty .
but in psychological and political terms , the deal signed could only be perceived as legiti@@ mi@@ zing for iran ’ s nuclear ambi@@ tions , not to mention north korea ’ s .
it was the ultimate proof that the bush administration does not believe in universal norms .
a “ good ” country would be treated with extreme len@@ i@@ ency , whereas a “ bad ” country would not .
gu@@ ant@@ á@@ nam@@ o , abu ghraib , and more recent war@@ -@@ crimes sc@@ and@@ als have done much worse damage to america ’ s stat@@ ure .
regimes that systematically viol@@ ate human rights have been quick to sei@@ ze on every episode of us wrong@@ doing .
with its own human rights record in question , the us , which had been the democratic teacher of the post-@@ war world , is in a much weaker position to give lessons and set standards .
nor does the appearance of hypo@@ cris@@ y end there .
at a time when “ democracy ” and “ democra@@ tization ” have become the wat@@ ch@@ words of us foreign policy , norm@@ alization of diplo@@ matic relations with gad@@ da@@ fi ’ s libya , not to mention len@@ i@@ ency towards egypt and saudi arabia hardly boo@@ sts america ’ s credi@@ bility .
in global terms , the contrast between what america says and what it does has become gl@@ aring .
in february 2005 , in a major speech in paris during her first foreign trip as secretary of state , con@@ do@@ le@@ e@@ zz@@ a rice stated america ’ s ambition in the world .
she said essentially the following : “ the role of the world is to improve the world .
america , as the most powerful and ethical country in the world , has a unique responsibility to perform . ”
eigh@@ teen months later , the results are falling far short of the goal .
on the contrary , the failures of us policy have contributed to reduce the legiti@@ macy of america ’ s power further .
despite the recent death of zar@@ q@@ awi in iraq , the situation there , and in afghanistan , does not justify the continued bush administration ’ s optimism .
as america ’ s legiti@@ macy dimin@@ ishes , new actors are appearing on the world stage – or returning for an en@@ core .
russia and china today are united not only by their energy deals , but also by both countries ’ convi@@ ction that their time has come , and that the outside world needs them more than they need the outside world , particularly the us .
in strategic terms , the wan@@ ing influence of a paralyzed europe is also very bad news for america .
the us needs allies now more than ever , for the world is rever@@ ting to its pre-@@ war multi-@@ polar state .
of course , given america ’ s objective military super@@ i@@ ority , i would call it “ asym@@ metri@@ cal multi-@@ polar@@ ity . ” but the us is no longer the country that others seek to emu@@ late , or that they look to for global leadership .
it is too early to dis@@ miss america and pro@@ claim the end of an imperial moment .
the next us president should be able to capit@@ alize on americans ’ fundamental optimism , prag@@ mati@@ sm , and ac@@ tivism .
but he or she will face an uph@@ ill struggle to prove to the world that america can be a force for good , a democratic be@@ ac@@ on that cares for the planet and that lives up to the standards that it sets for others .
when are public services successful ?
how do we judge the quality of public services ?
that question is far trick@@ ier than it appears .
in some cases the answer seems simple enough : whether trains run on time .
but is this really all we want from our trains ?
surely not .
they should be safe , too , and reasonably comfortable .
they should run not only on time , but at the right time and at reasonable inter@@ vals .
more important still , they should be affordable .
as the list of criteria grows longer , it becomes evident that the most easily measured component , pun@@ ctu@@ ality , is but one of many des@@ ir@@ able features , and not necessarily the most significant .
this example is relevant for the politics of public services , which domin@@ ates debate in many countries because it lies at the heart of the big problems of both government budgets ( and cutting them back ) and taxes ( and their reduction ) .
in keeping with the spirit of the times , governments introduce business criteria for measuring the effici@@ ency@@ -@@ -@@ and the &quot; success , &quot; more gener@@ ally-@@ -@@ of public services .
this means , above all , that they set performance targets .
so ministers pro@@ claim that street crime will be hal@@ ved by next spring , or that the proportion of each generation going to universities will be raised to 50 % in five years . waiting lists for hospital beds will be cut by one-third within two years .
this method of governance makes it appear that , at long last , we can hold politicians accountable by establi@@ shing whether targets have been reached or not .
but is this what we really want ?
the examples just given are taken from real life .
in real life , however , performance targets also have curious side effects .
cutting hospital waiting lists has led doctors to treat minor illnesses more quickly , leaving those with more serious conditions off the lists altogether .
the rapid increase in university students has led to dec@@ lines in ad@@ mission standards and the quality of final degrees .
reducing street crime encouraged the police to stop regi@@ stering certain offen@@ ses altogether .
in short , because the availability of government support depends on achieving seemingly precise targets , the incentive to aim for apparent rather than real success becomes an almost overwhelming temptation .
moreover , many public services are so-called &quot; soft services . &quot;
hospital care ent@@ a@@ ils much more than a well-@@ functioning conve@@ yor belt for surgical operations .
education is in all cases about more than achieving a certain &quot; through@@ put . &quot;
social services generally need time , not least the time of caregi@@ vers , and their time is often required in unpredictable bur@@ st@@ s-@@ -@@ a fact utterly at odds with targe@@ t-@@ man@@ ia .
obviously , public money must not be wasted .
but , even here , questions arise .
it is in the nature of such research that it proce@@ eds by trial and error .
for every road to new discoveries , there will be several negative results and cul@@ -@@ de-@@ sac@@ s .
if only highly targeted research with guaranteed success is funded , the probability must be high that innovative researchers emi@@ gra@@ te to countries or institutions that have a more generous and appropriate approach to the relationship between funding and success .
while all this may be true , the question remains : how do we make sure that public services are run with reasonable efficiency and produce the results intended by governments and expected by taxpa@@ yers ?
one answer has to do with input rather than out@@ com@@ es-@@ -@@ that is , with the quality and e@@ thos of those running our public services and working in them .
here the business analogy is simply not sufficient .
the old french administra@@ tive training for public services taught both relevant skills and an e@@ thos of civic commitment .
the old civil service in countries like britain or germany embraced an approach to their tasks that made it a matter of honor to perform well .
self-interest and charity are not the only human moti@@ vations ; there is also the motive of service , and it needs to be cultiv@@ ated .
at the other end-@@ -@@ that of resul@@ ts@@ -@@ -@@ some targets do make sense .
trains should run on time .
but beyond that is the human judgment of those most affected .
this is why parents &apos; coun@@ cils for schools , or commit@@ te@@ es of users of public transport , or patients &apos; boards for hospitals are crucial .
such bodies may seem weak at first sight .
they may even be regarded as a nu@@ is@@ ance by professionals .
in fact , however , they provide an inv@@ alu@@ able check on slo@@ ppy and inefficient providers of public services .
we must be@@ ware of over@@ ly business-@@ guided approaches to public service .
at certain times and in certain countries , services that need not be public had to be priva@@ tized and run along business lines in order to make them run bet@@ ter-@@ -@@ or to keep them running at all .
but core public services in health , education , transport , and a few other areas will forever be just that , services , and will therefore need to be appreciated in more complex ways than meeting measurable targets .
when capital markets fail
when democracies collide
berlin – the multi@@ polar nature of today ’ s international system will again be on display at the up@@ coming g-@@ 20 summit in los cab@@ os , mexico .
global problems are no longer solved , crises managed , or global rules defined , let alone implemented , the old-fashioned way , by a few , mostly western , powers .
inci@@ pi@@ ent great and middle powers , such as india , brazil , indonesia , south korea , turkey , and south africa , also demand their say .
some of these powers are still emerging economies .
politically , however , most of them have crossed the threshold that has long limited their access to the kitchen of international decision-making .
the five permanent members of the united nations security council ( the “ p-@@ 5 ” ) still defend their right to ve@@ to resol@@ u@@ tions , and their military power is un@@ matched .
but they can no longer dis@@ pose of sufficient resources , compe@@ tence , and legiti@@ macy to cope with global challenges or crises on their own .
bi@@ polar@@ ity is a thing of the past , and it is unlikely to re-@@ emerge in a new sin@@ o-@@ american “ g-@@ 2 . ”
it is equally unlikely for the fores@@ ee@@ able future that any one club of countries , such as the g-@@ 7 or g-@@ 8 , will again assume a qu@@ asi@@ -@@ he@@ ge@@ mon@@ ic position .
even the g-@@ 20 in its current composition may not really represent the forces that can and will shape the twenty-@@ first century .
for the un@@ ites states , the european union , japan , and other members of the “ old west , ” the good news is that most of the emerging powers that are posi@@ tioning themselves for a more active global role are also democracies .
within the g-@@ 20 , only two states – china and saudi arabia – explicitly do not want to be liberal democracies , while a third , russia , has developed into an auto@@ cracy with a democratic fa@@ ç@@ ade .
the not-@@ so-@@ good news is that these new democratic powers do not necessarily share the old west ’ s political agenda .
for example , they differ about climate policies , seeing a threat to development .
similarly , while new middle and great powers do not always agree , they are generally more skeptical of both international san@@ ctions and military interventions .
moreover , some of the most important of these states differ substan@@ tially with the us , and often also with the eu , about the right approach toward regional conflicts , especially in the middle east .
thus , in 2010 , the us found itself in a serious diplo@@ matic dispute with turkey and brazil about how to resolve the conflict with iran over its nuclear program .
without actually admit@@ ting it , the us was clearly unhappy that these two states tried to play a diplo@@ matic role of their own in the dispute .
differences are also apparent where new democratic middle or great powers have formed new groups or clubs , such as the bri@@ cs , together with non-@@ democratic powers .
india , brazil , and south africa are using such formats in a pragmatic way to pursue their interests , or simply to demonstrate their increased international weight .
there is little agreement between them and russia or china – both p-@@ 5 members – with regard to political values or to fundamental questions of international order .
along with many other states in the global south , however , russia and china tend to defend the principle of non-@@ interference , and they are generally reluctant to support any us or european attempts to project democracy or defend human rights in other countries .
not a few policymakers in the us and in europe have re@@ acted with aston@@ ishment , or even anno@@ y@@ ance , to these emerging democratic powers ’ attempts to pursue their own agen@@ das on the world stage .
such reactions partly reflect old thinking rooted in the cold war , when democratic countries might differ over details , but would agree about the main questions of international politics .
those who pursu@@ ed a different agenda on substantial matters were either not part of the “ democratic camp ” or were not important international players .
by contrast , a central feature of today ’ s globalized , multi@@ polar world is that shared democratic values do not guarantee agreement about substantial questions of international politics .
the more democracies there are , the more conflicts of interests and differences are likely to emerge between democratic countries .
there is little reason to react with anger when states like turkey , brazil , and south africa set priorities different from those of europe or the us , or have different views about how to deal with the arab@@ -@@ israeli conflict , iran , development aid , democracy promotion , or environmental protection .
the us example shows clearly that democratic great powers often pursue their interests with little regard for a global common good that others have defined .
in other words , the international order is becoming more plur@@ alistic .
the task for established western democracies is to accept and cope with such “ democratic differences ” on the international level , and to seek multi@@ lat@@ eral co@@ ali@@ tions to manage or solve problems .
in principle , the eu is better posi@@ tioned than the us ( and certainly than china ) to take on this task .
europeans are well practiced in dealing with differences and shaping consensus among princi@@ p@@ ally like@@ -@@ minded states .
that said , europe needs to learn to be clear@@ er and more transparent about the interests underlying its own policies , rather than suggesting that its positions on a specific subject represent the only rational imple@@ mentation of democratic values and norms .
when doctors kill
princeton – of all the arguments against voluntary eu@@ than@@ asia , the most influential is the “ sli@@ pper@@ y slope ” : once we allow doctors to kill patients , we will not be able to limit the killing to those who want to die .
there is no evidence for this claim , even after many years of legal physi@@ ci@@ an-@@ assi@@ sted suicide or voluntary eu@@ than@@ asia in the netherlands , bel@@ gi@@ um , lux@@ em@@ bour@@ g , switzerland , and the american state of oregon .
but recent revel@@ ations about what took place in a new orleans hospital after hurricane katrina point to a genuine danger from a different source .
when new orleans was floo@@ ded in august 2005 , the rising water cut off memorial medical center , a community hospital that was holding more than 200 patients .
three days after the hurricane hit , the hospital had no electricity , the water supply had failed , and toilets could no longer be flus@@ hed .
some patients who were dependent on venti@@ lat@@ ors died .
in sti@@ fl@@ ing heat , doctors and nurses were hard-@@ pres@@ sed to care for surviving patients lying on so@@ iled beds .
adding to the anxiety were fears that law and order had broken down in the city , and that the hospital itself might be a target for armed ban@@ di@@ ts .
helicop@@ ters were called in to ev@@ acu@@ ate patients .
priority was given to those who were in better health , and could walk .
state police arrived and told staff that because of the civil un@@ rest , everybody had to be out of the hospital by 5 p.@@ m .
on the eighth floor , jan@@ nie bur@@ ges@@ s , a 7@@ 9@@ -year-old woman with advanced cancer , was on a morph@@ ine drip and close to death .
to ev@@ acu@@ ate her , she would have to be carried down six flights of stairs , and would require the attention of nurses who were needed elsewhere .
but if she were left un@@ atten@@ ded , she might come out of her se@@ dation , and be in pain .
e@@ wing cook , one of the physicians present , instru@@ cted the nurse to increase the morph@@ ine , “ giving her enough until she goes . ”
it was , he later told sher@@ i fin@@ k , who recently published an account of these events in the new york times , a “ no-@@ brain@@ er . ”
according to fin@@ k , anna po@@ u , another physician , told nursing staff that several patients on the seventh floor were also too ill to survive .
she injected them with morph@@ ine and another drug that slowed their breathing until they died .
at least one of the patients injected with this lethal combination of drugs appears to have otherwise been in little danger of im@@ min@@ ent death . em@@ me@@ tt ever@@ ett was a 6@@ 1@@ -year-old man who had been paralyzed in an accident several years earlier , and was in the hospital for surgery to relie@@ ve a bo@@ wel ob@@ stru@@ ction .
when others from his ward were ev@@ acu@@ ated , he asked not to be left behind .
but he weighed 3@@ 80 pounds ( 17@@ 3 kilograms ) , and it would have been extremely difficult to carry him down the stairs and then up again to where the helicop@@ ters were landing .
he was told the injection he was being given would help with the di@@ zz@@ iness from which he suffered .
in 1957 , a group of doctors asked pope pi@@ us xi@@ i whether it is per@@ mis@@ sible to use nar@@ co@@ tics to suppress pain and consciousness “ if one fores@@ e@@ es that the use of nar@@ co@@ tics will sh@@ orten life . ”
the pope said that it was .
in its declar@@ ation on eu@@ than@@ asia , issued in 1980 , the va@@ ti@@ can re@@ affir@@ med that view .
the va@@ ti@@ can ’ s position is an application of what is known as “ the doctrine of double effect . ”
an action that has two effects , one good and the other bad , may be per@@ mis@@ sible if the good effect is the one that is intended and the bad effect is merely an un@@ wanted consequence of achieving the good effect .
significantly , neither the pope ’ s re@@ marks , nor the declar@@ ation on eu@@ than@@ asia , place any emphasis on the importance of ob@@ taining the voluntary and informed consent of patients , where possible , before shor@@ ten@@ ing their lives .
dr. cook had little time for such sub@@ tle@@ ties .
only “ a very na@@ ï@@ ve doctor ” would think that giving a person a lot of morph@@ ine was not “ pre@@ ma@@ tur@@ ely sending them to their grave , ” he told fin@@ k , and then bl@@ un@@ tly added : “ we kill ‘ em . ”
at memorial medical center , physicians and nurses found themselves under great pressure .
exhausted after 72 hours with little sleep , and struggling to care for their patients , they were not in the best position to make difficult ethical decisions .
the doctrine of double effect , properly understood , does not justify what the doctors did ; but , by in@@ uring them to the practice of shor@@ ten@@ ing patients ’ lives without ob@@ taining consent , it seems to have pa@@ ved the way for intentional killing .
roman catholic thinkers have been among the most vocal in inv@@ o@@ king the “ sli@@ pper@@ y slope ” argument against the leg@@ alization of voluntary eu@@ than@@ asia and physi@@ ci@@ an-@@ assi@@ sted dying .
they would do well to examine the consequences of their own doc@@ trin@@ es .
when enough is not enough
new york – the us dollar is pl@@ ung@@ ing , the economy is im@@ plo@@ ding , and a crisis of identity is shaking countries around the world .
so , what are americans obsessed with at this critical moment ?
“ oc@@ tam@@ om ” : the sa@@ ga of na@@ dy@@ a su@@ le@@ man , a young single mother in los angeles who , having already given birth to seven children , under@@ went fertility treatments and is now bringing home oc@@ tu@@ ple@@ ts .
the story would ordinarily be a mere curiosity .
it is true that there is plenty to con@@ dem@@ n : su@@ le@@ man ’ s family lives on food stam@@ ps , the children already at home don ’ t have enough baby furniture , and her own parents are giving interviews to the media in which they critici@@ ze her choices .
her publi@@ cist quit , calling her “ crazy . ”
there have been plenty of odd@@ ball flash@@ -in-@@ the-@@ pan media stars in us popular culture before su@@ le@@ man .
but her story just goes on and on , and the emotion that atta@@ ches to it seems strangely furi@@ ous and ven@@ ge@@ ful .
i believe that americans ’ obsession with su@@ le@@ man is a projection of their own guilt and shame at their recent choices .
su@@ le@@ man does not have a decent job , but she managed to invest in costly fertility treatments and could afford many expensive cos@@ me@@ tic surgeries .
worse yet , her surgeries seem designed to make her resemble the ac@@ tress angel@@ ina j@@ ol@@ ie .
she somehow has a spac@@ i@@ ous house , but no proper beds for the kids .
in other times , it would have been the absence of a man that turned su@@ le@@ man into an object of public sc@@ orn .
today , that sc@@ arc@@ ely regi@@ sters against the other themes : a work@@ ing-@@ class or unemployed person dar@@ ed to aspi@@ re to resemble someone of too high a status , and spent too much money concei@@ ving too many bl@@ am@@ eless babies who deserve protection and care , and who have now been put at risk by their mother ’ s selfish choices .
be@@ wit@@ ched by symbols of afflu@@ ence and a level of consumption that she could not afford , she acted like a child herself , with no thought to the future .
right now , americans are staggering from the reality of what they themselves have done .
the real estate bubble in@@ fl@@ ated and collapsed partly because millions of americans bor@@ rowed more than they could afford to re@@ pay – and knew it .
it takes nothing away from the pain of those now losing their houses to notice that something odd@@ ly american and a bit per@@ verse happened : millions of americans were se@@ duced by fantas@@ ies of a beautiful big house , vague about their own plans for the future , and yet full of crazy confidence that it would all somehow work out .
american optimism became as much a cur@@ se as a blessing .
the credit freeze is partly the work of bankers and he@@ dge fund managers who acted just like na@@ dy@@ a su@@ le@@ man , lever@@ aging the present for an un@@ reali@@ zable future .
but it is also the result of ordinary americans , who ran up more credit card debt than any previous generation .
in the mall , or at home on the internet , americans acted like na@@ dy@@ a su@@ le@@ man , too : se@@ duced by the bag , the shoes , the beauty treatments , the vac@@ ations , and the life that the stars they admire take for granted .
and , with education and health care fal@@ tering and social security funding at risk , their kids , like su@@ le@@ man ’ s , are now endangered partly because of their own choices .
the manage@@ able , hon@@ orable american dream of the 1950 ’ s – a decent , affordable college education ; a small house of one ’ s own ; hope that one ’ s children will be better off than ones@@ elf – was mis@@ placed in the last decade and a half .
in the new , real@@ ity-@@ show version of that dream , countless americans came to expect to be able to live , look , dance , and party like celebri@@ ties , or else feel themselves to be failures .
enough is not enough anymore .
that is the american dream that na@@ dy@@ a su@@ le@@ man bought into , and , in their obsession with her , americans are coming to gri@@ ps with how seriously they went a@@ stra@@ y .
indeed , a strange sense of relief is now cre@@ eping into americans ’ consciousness as the consumer economy grin@@ ds to a halt .
the relief comes from not as@@ pir@@ ing to spend like su@@ le@@ man , or brit@@ ney spears , or the neighbors down the street .
it comes from the thought that this really might be enough to be able to afford a small house , a college education , and the children that one already has .
not long ago , an american political analyst compared france ’ s loss of influence in europe following its “ no ” vote in the 2005 refer@@ end@@ um on the eu constitu@@ tional treaty with france ’ s sur@@ render in 1940 .
a provo@@ cative analogy , but is it ap@@ t ?
the collapse in 1940 revealed the fragi@@ lity of france ’ s democracy and its loss of confidence in the country ’ s capacity to face outside threats .
in reje@@ cting the european constitution , france expressed its fear of , among other things , globalization .
a better analogy for the no vote was the reje@@ ction in 1954 of the treaty to establish a european defense community ( ed@@ c ) .
in both cases , a major historical mistake was made .
france had to a large extent initi@@ ated both treaties , had managed to get them accepted by its european partners , but in the end ve@@ to@@ ed its own under@@ ta@@ kings .
why , in both 1954 and 2005 , did the french – in one case the national assembly , in the other the elec@@ tor@@ ate – reject pro@@ pos@@ als that france itself had conceived ?
both projects sought to construct a genuinely supr@@ an@@ ational europe .
the ed@@ c would have created a european army , in which even german troops would have been included .
the proposed defense treaty was also to be but@@ tr@@ essed by plans for a european political community whose main features were to be defined by a constitu@@ tional commission made up of members of national parli@@ am@@ ents .
in effect , this commission would have been the pre@@ cursor to the 200@@ 3-@@ 2004 convention for the future of europe , which , presi@@ ded over by former french president val@@ é@@ ry g@@ is@@ card d ’ e@@ sta@@ ing dra@@ fted the constitu@@ tional treaty .
the political community of the 1950 ’ s that france had persu@@ aded its five european partners to accept was supposed to absorb both the european coal and steel community and the ed@@ c .
it was to have both diplo@@ matic and military powers , as well as a leg@@ isla@@ tive assembly much like today ’ s european parliament – just as the 2005 eu constitu@@ tional plan would have extended the european parliament ’ s powers and created a european minister of foreign affairs .
but now , as back then , fear and doubt won the day .
political parties and others who mobili@@ zed opposition to the ed@@ c fe@@ ared a re@@ milit@@ arized germany and a threat to france ’ s sovereig@@ n@@ ty .
today , those in france who opposed the eu constitution succeeded in stigmati@@ zing “ europe ” as the threat .
they trum@@ pe@@ ted france ’ s invasion by “ polish plum@@ bers , ” calling into question europe ’ s two principal achievements : the introduction of a single market , which has un@@ deni@@ ably boo@@ sted the french economy , and eu en@@ lar@@ gement , which has done so much to foster democratic transition in new member states .
but the failure of the refer@@ end@@ um in france carries more serious consequences than the ed@@ c ’ s reje@@ ction .
back in the 1950 ’ s , the founding nations ’ foreign ministers promp@@ tly turned to their bel@@ gian colleague , pau@@ l-@@ hen@@ ri spa@@ ak , for fresh pro@@ pos@@ als .
after intensive discussion among the six , and especially between france and germany , the treaty of rome was drawn up and signed within two years of the ed@@ c de@@ bac@@ le .
by contrast , two years after the french and dutch no votes , there is no sign of a plan b , despite the claims of the french politicians who helped mobili@@ ze the no vote . europe ’ s fran@@ co-@@ german locom@@ o@@ tive has broken down and rati@@ fication has stopped , even though member states that had yet to rati@@ fy the treaty could have completed the process of rati@@ fication .
france ’ s loss of influence in europe is no longer at stake today , because the notion of influence pres@@ up@@ poses that the over@@ riding pre@@ occupation of eu member states is to advance their own national interests .
if europe were only about gaining the upper hand , it would generate perpe@@ tual conflict .
the reality is that europe does manage to move ahead , but step by step through mutual compromise .
the real question has more to do with france ’ s credi@@ bility and its capacity to remain a driving force in europe .
a journalist recently expressed the view that france ’ s special role in europe was due to its “ centr@@ ality , ” meaning that the french are , in equal measure , both open to the world and attached to their nation . they also participate successfully in a market economy while seeking to preserve an egal@@ itarian social model .
the no vote su@@ lli@@ ed this image of a balanced france .
indeed , the french themselves are among the first to lam@@ ent their b@@ leak situation , inventing a new concept – “ la d@@ é@@ clin@@ ologie ” – to describe this loss of self – confidence .
moreover , the no vote has given a new legiti@@ macy to euro@@ -@@ skep@@ ticism in other member states .
to be sure , the rise of popu@@ li@@ sm in europe was not caused by the french ; nation@@ alism is deeply rooted in europe ’ s history and has many causes .
but france ’ s refer@@ end@@ um result fu@@ eled other european governments ’ fears that any new proposal they might put forward to re-@@ launch the eu constitution would fail in the face of domestic and europe@@ -@@ wide opposition .
but reducing european aspirations to the goals of real@@ politik is no answer to today ’ s crisis .
europeans need to recognize that strength lies in unity , and that europe ’ s integration cannot be guaranteed without a common constitu@@ tional framework that promotes a common identity .
until we think in terms of european sovereig@@ n@@ ty , rather than fre@@ t over risks to national sovereig@@ n@@ ty , the present crisis cannot be overcome .
when india votes
kerala , india – beginning this month , the largest exercise of the democratic franch@@ ise in history will take place , as india n voters head to the polls to ele@@ ct a new national parliament . they have done this 14 times since india gained its independence .
each time india has voted has been the world ’ s largest exercise in elec@@ toral democracy . india ’ s growing population keeps breaking its own record .
this time , the elec@@ tor@@ ate includes 7@@ 14 million voters , an increase of 43 million over the previous general election in 2004 .
votes will be cast in 8@@ 2@@ 8,@@ 80@@ 4 poll@@ ing stations scat@@ tered throughout the country for over 5000 candidates from seven national political parties and several state and other parties .
the process involves four million elec@@ toral officials and 6.@@ 1 million police and civilian personnel .
the numbers involved are so huge that the elections will be stag@@ gered over five phases , ending only on may 13 , with elec@@ toral and security personnel being moved from state to state as poll@@ ing is concluded in each place .
despite the ph@@ ased voting , the counting takes place nation@@ wide immediately after the last phase , and the results of the elections everywhere will be announced on may 16 .
a new parliament will be conven@@ ed on june 2 to ele@@ ct a national government to succeed the out@@ going administration of prime minister man@@ mo@@ han sing@@ h .
india ’ s elections , conducted by the autonomous ( and all-@@ powerful ) election commission of india , are an extraordinary event , and not just because of their sheer scale .
it takes the f@@ elling of a si@@ ze@@ able forest to fur@@ nish enough paper for 7@@ 14 million ball@@ ots , and every election has at least one story of officers bat@@ tling through snow or jungle , or traveling by elephant and camel , to ensure that the democratic wishes of remote constitu@@ ents are du@@ ly recorded .
( there is even one poll@@ ing booth for a single vot@@ er , who lives too far from civilization to travel to another poll@@ ing station . )
nor is any indian election complete without the media publishing at least one picture of a female vot@@ er whose enthusiasm for the suff@@ rage is un@@ di@@ mmed by the fact that she is old , blind , cri@@ p@@ pled , tooth@@ less , pur@@ da@@ h-@@ cla@@ d , or any combination of the above .
the exo@@ tica do not end there .
because so many voters are illiterate , india invented the party symbol , so that voters who cannot read the name of their candidate can vote for him or her anyway by recognizing the symbol under which they campaig@@ ned .
symbols range from the open palm of the rul@@ ing indian national congress to the lot@@ us of the b@@ har@@ ati@@ ya jan@@ ata party and vari@@ ants of the hammer and sick@@ le for india ’ s pro@@ fusion of communist parties .
independent candidates can choose from an as@@ sor@@ tment of alternatives , ranging from a cricket bat to images of various large animals .
( small ones were removed from the list when one candidate , running against another whose symbol was a par@@ rot , wr@@ ung the neck of a live par@@ rot at a public meeting to signi@@ fy what he would do to his ri@@ val . )
india was also the first country to use an inde@@ li@@ ble sta@@ in on the vot@@ er ’ s finger@@ nail to signi@@ fy that he has already cast his bal@@ lot .
at every election , someone “ disco@@ vers ” a new chemical that will remove the sta@@ in and per@@ mit one to vote twice , though this is unlikely to make a great difference in constitu@@ encies the size of india ’ s , where each mp represents more than two million people .
likewise , some distingu@@ ished vot@@ er inv@@ ari@@ ably claims that his name is missing from the rolls , or that someone has already cast his vote ( but usually not both ) .
in any case , india ’ s elections have a reputation for honesty .
in this election , as in previous ones , votes will be cast on electronic voting machines invented in india , which combine the virtues of simplicity , reli@@ ability , and rug@@ ge@@ dness .
the elec@@ toral rolls carry photographs of every individual vot@@ er , as does each vot@@ er ’ s identity card .
the elections have also been increasingly free of violence .
there was a time when , in certain parts of india , workers could stuff bal@@ lot boxes for a candidate and political parties could “ capture ” poll@@ ing boo@@ ths .
electronic voting machines and strict security arrangements have largely eliminated that possibility .
it has been some time since there were reports of the occasi@@ onal election worker , candidate , or vot@@ er being assau@@ l@@ ted , kidna@@ pped , or shot .
elections are an enduring spectac@@ le of free india , and give foreign journalists the opportunity to remind the world that india is the world ’ s largest democracy .
indeed , indians now take for granted that elections will take place , that they will be free and fair , and that they will result in actual transfers of power .
there are few developing countries in the world where this is true , and fewer still where poverty and il@@ literacy are both ri@@ fe .
that may be the real miracle of what will occur in india over the next few weeks .
when internet boom went bust
while the internet boom lasted , nothing seemed able to def@@ late the bubble .
few internet and dot com companies were profitable , but investors never seemed to mind .
they looked at the number of customers or subscri@@ bers as the basis for valu@@ ing internet stocks .
the name of the game became raising capital , not making profits .
even when fashi@@ on@@ able stocks di@@ pped , there was remarkably little effect on the rest of the market .
people had learned that it pays to buy the di@@ ps , and were not we@@ an@@ ed from the habit until it ceased to pay .
now that internet fever has ab@@ ated , we hear that the “ fundament@@ als ” are reas@@ ser@@ ting themselves .
but this view is as much a half-@@ truth as the previous notion that the boom would last forever because the internet economy had created new fundament@@ als .
indeed , the internet boom / bust cycle brings into question prevail@@ ing economic theories about financial markets .
what should now be clear is that the so-called fundament@@ als that supposedly determine stock prices are not independently given .
instead , they are cont@@ ing@@ ent on the behavior of financial markets .
there are , indeed , myri@@ ad ways in which stock prices affect the fortun@@ es of companies : they determine the cost of equity capital ; they decide whether a company will be taken over or acquire other companies ; stock prices influence a company ’ s capacity to borrow and its ability to attract and reward management through stock options ; stock prices serve as an advertising and marketing tool .
in other words , when financial markets believe a company is doing well , its “ fundament@@ als ” improve ; when markets change their mind , the actual fortun@@ es of the company change with them .
moreover , changes in financial markets also have far reaching macro@@ economic consequences .
it did not take a genius to realize that the internet boom , based not on profit expectations but on the expectations of selling stock to the public at ever increasing prices , re@@ sted on an unsustainable business model .
it also did not take a genius to see that boom would be followed by bust , but it was harder to guess when that bust would occur .
in the summer of 1999 i was convinced that an internet crash was im@@ min@@ ent .
yet internet stocks recovered from a short dip ; some soon rose to new high@@ s .
institutions that live and die by relative performance felt obli@@ ged to increase their internet hol@@ dings .
when yahoo was included in the s &amp; p 500 index , it jumped 30 % in a day .
people like me who had sold internet stocks short in the belief that a crash was im@@ min@@ ent were forced to cover them at wh@@ opping losses .
i remained convinced that a bust was bound to come , but i could not afford to stand by my convi@@ ctions .
despite its irrational aspects , the internet boom was more than a matter of in@@ fl@@ ated valu@@ ations .
the optimism of the financial markets not only changed the “ fundament@@ als ” of individual businesses , it had real and profound effects throughout the whole economy .
the boom did not only follow from the development of the internet ; it accelerated that development and contributed to the speed and extension of technological innovation .
the same was true in telecommunications , where the boom also accelerated the spread of new technology .
the internet bust , when it finally came , was caused not by an un@@ sound business model , but by over-@@ extension of credit .
the present slow@@ down is affecting the fundament@@ als of individual companies almost as much as their stock prices ; it also affects the financial system and macro@@ economic performance .
instead of a one-@@ way connection in which financial markets dis@@ count the future more or less accurately , there exists a two-way connection in which financial markets shape the future they are supposed to dis@@ count .
instead of a single outcome , there is a range of possibilities .
which of those possibilities materi@@ alizes depends not only on the future evolution of the so-called fundament@@ als but on financial market behavior as well .
in these circumstances , it is irrational for market participants to base their decisions sol@@ ely on their expectations about fundament@@ als because the fundament@@ als do not determine market prices ; on the contrary , they are shaped by market conditions .
so what matters to market participants is the future course of market prices , not the fundament@@ als they are said to reflect .
if market prices devi@@ ate from a theoretical equilibrium there can be no as@@ sur@@ ance that they will ever return to it .
this is why the recent boom / bust sequence in internet and tele@@ communication stocks is so revealing .
these developments cannot be explained in terms of efficient markets and rational expectations .
i have proposed an alternative explanation based on the two-way connection between fundament@@ als and valu@@ ations which i call “ reflexi@@ vity ” .
i am amazed and am@@ used that economists ignore my arguments .
they claim that the phenomenon of reflexi@@ vity is already taken into account in the concept of multiple equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ a which has gained acceptance recently .
maybe so , but i have yet to see how persistent movements away from a theoretical equilibrium can be explained within the framework of multiple equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ a .
any divergence from equilibrium , whether one assumes that there is a unique equilibrium or many equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ a , amounts to more than noise ; it is a cau@@ sal factor in determin@@ ing the very nature of the “ equilibrium ” that will pre@@ va@@ il .
by ignor@@ ing this condition , efficient market theory presents a totally mis@@ leading picture of financial markets .
why is my reasoning dis@@ missed out of hand ?
because it leads to the conclusion that financial markets are inherently unpredictable .
what is the value of a scientific theory , i am asked , if it does not yield use@@ able predictions ?
i con@@ tend that it would be better to recognize the un@@ certain@@ ties inherent in the behavior of financial markets than to cling to a supposedly scientific theory that distor@@ ts reality .
one consequence of the realization that financial markets are potentially unstable , is a recognition of the need for financial authorities to make it their business to prevent ex@@ cess@@ es .
the debate about efficient markets may be ar@@ cane , but the consequences for our lives are very real indeed .
new york – egypt and thailand have little in common , except for one thing . in both countries , at different times , educated people who pride themselves on being democrats have ended up applau@@ ding military cou@@ ps against elected governments .
they had resi@@ sted oppres@@ sive military regimes for many years .
but , in thailand in 2006 , as in egypt last month , they were happy to see their political leaders ou@@ sted by force .
this per@@ ver@@ sity is not without reason .
the elected leaders in both countries , th@@ ak@@ sin sh@@ in@@ a@@ wat@@ ra in thailand and mohamed mor@@ si in egypt , were good examples of il@@ liberal democrats : they ten@@ ded to view their elec@@ toral success as a mandate to manipulate constitu@@ tional norms and behave like auto@@ crats .
they are not alone in this respect .
in fact , they are probably typical of leaders in countries with little or no history of democratic government .
turkey ’ s prime minister , re@@ ce@@ p ta@@ y@@ yi@@ p er@@ do@@ ğ@@ an , is in the same camp .
and if the leaders of al@@ geria ’ s islamic sal@@ vation front ( f@@ is ) had been allowed to take power in 1991 , after their early success in a democratic election , they would almost certainly have been il@@ liberal rul@@ ers .
( instead , they were crushed by a military coup , before a second round of elections could take place , trig@@ gering a brutal eight-@@ year civil war in which an estimated 200,000 people died . )
the after@@ math of the 2006 coup in thailand was not nearly so bloody .
but the bitter@@ ness ling@@ ers among sh@@ in@@ a@@ wat@@ ra ’ s suppor@@ ters – even now , when his sister , y@@ ing@@ luck , is prime minister .
street violence is a constant threat .
only the fra@@ il and a@@ iling 8@@ 5@@ -year-old king bhu@@ mi@@ bo@@ l adul@@ y@@ ade@@ j still functions as a symbol of national co@@ h@@ esi@@ on .
without him , fighting between the rural poor and the urban elites could quickly er@@ u@@ pt again .
this does not bo@@ de well for thai democracy .
another military intervention is the last thing the country needs .
in egypt , things look far worse at the moment .
the leader of the military coup , general ab@@ dul@@ -@@ f@@ atta@@ h al-@@ sis@@ i , has promised to confront mor@@ si ’ s muslim bro@@ ther@@ hood with maximum force .
in two separate inci@@ dents in july , security forces opened fire on suppor@@ ters of the bro@@ ther@@ hood as they peac@@ efully prote@@ sted against mor@@ si ’ s ou@@ ster and arrest , killing almost 200 people .
secre@@ t-@@ police units that were active under former president ho@@ sn@@ i mubarak ( and known for their frequent use of torture ) are being re@@ constitu@@ ted for the first time since the 2011 revolution .
none of this is either democratic or liberal .
and yet many egyptians , including some human-@@ rights activists , have end@@ or@@ sed it .
one man , who was sa@@ vag@@ ely st@@ om@@ ped by a member of the armed forces in tahrir square in 2011 , now claims that the egyptian people should “ stand together ” with the military , and that all muslim bro@@ ther@@ hood leaders should be arrested .
a promin@@ ent democracy activist , es@@ ra@@ a ab@@ del f@@ atta@@ h , has den@@ oun@@ ced mor@@ si ’ s party as a gang of foreig@@ n-@@ backed terrorists .
the army leadership is saying the same thing : special measures , maximum force , and revi@@ ved security units are all necessary to “ fight terrorism . ”
some foreign comm@@ ent@@ ators have been as delu@@ ded as egyptians who back the coup .
a well-known dutch nove@@ list voic@@ ed a rather typical response , saying that he didn ’ t care much what happened to mor@@ si ’ s suppor@@ ters , for they were all “ islam@@ o-@@ fas@@ cists ” anyway .
and foreign governments , including that of the united states , are aver@@ ting their eyes .
president barack obama ’ s administration ref@@ uses to describe what happened as a “ coup . ”
us secretary of state john kerry even cla@@ imed that the military was “ restor@@ ing democracy . ”
there is no doubt that mor@@ si ’ s government was in@@ experienced , often in@@ competent , and showed little interest in listening to views other than those of its suppor@@ ters , which were often far from liberal .
but mor@@ si ’ s people are not foreig@@ n-@@ backed terrorists . nor was mor@@ si an egyptian version of iran ’ s ay@@ at@@ ol@@ la@@ h ru@@ hol@@ la@@ h k@@ hom@@ ein@@ i .
the election that brought mor@@ si to power gave a political voice for the first time to millions of people , many of them poor , un@@ educated , and religious .
they may not have been very good democrats , or even particularly tolerant of different views .
many of them had opinions – for example , on the role of women , on sex , and on the place of islam in public life – that secular liberals find ab@@ hor@@ rent .
but sil@@ encing these people by force , and calling them foreig@@ n-@@ backed terrorists , can have only one result : more violence .
if the outcomes of democratic elections are not respected , people will seek other means to make themselves heard .
mor@@ si ’ s auto@@ cratic in@@ clin@@ ations may have damaged democracy ; taking him out in a coup deals it a mortal blow .
how to bridge the gap in developing countries between secular , more or less we@@ ster@@ ni@@ zed urban elites and the rural poor is an old question .
one solution is to en@@ force secular moderni@@ zation by oppres@@ sing the poor and their religious organizations .
egypt has already en@@ du@@ red the harsh rule of secular police states , of both the right and the left .
the other solution is to give democracy a chance .
this is not possible without allowing some form of religious expression in public life .
no democracy in the middle east that fails to take account of islam will work .
but , without the freedom to express other views and beliefs , democracy will remain il@@ liberal .
this is hard for islam@@ ist parties to accept .
many islam@@ ists may in fact prefer an il@@ liberal to a liberal democracy .
the alternative is to rever@@ t to il@@ liberal auto@@ cracy .
applau@@ ding the military coup against mor@@ si makes this the more likely outcome .
when marijuana is legal
br@@ is@@ ban@@ e – what will happen if califor@@ ni@@ ans votes this november to leg@@ alize marijuana use by any adult over the age of 21 years ?
let ’ s ignore for the moment the v@@ ex@@ ed constitu@@ tional issues that will be raised if a us state en@@ acts legislation that conflicts with federal law .
let ’ s focus instead on what may happen if the law changes as the refer@@ end@@ um pro@@ poses .
if we are to believe the refer@@ end@@ um ’ s suppor@@ ters , all califor@@ ni@@ ans will be winners .
the change will legiti@@ mize marijuana ’ s de fac@@ to legal status since passage of proposition 2@@ 15 in 1996 .
it will thus reduce state expen@@ di@@ ture on en@@ forcing a widely viol@@ ated law ; remove marijuana growing and selling from the black market ; enable any adult who wishes to use marijuana to do so ; and introduce a tax on legal marijuana sales that will fill state co@@ ff@@ ers with revenue that for@@ mer@@ ly went to illegal gro@@ wers ( so long as there is no large-scale tax ev@@ asion ) .
by contrast , oppon@@ ents predict that the change will increase rates of marijuana use , and thus magni@@ fy the harm ar@@ is@@ ing from that use .
the ad@@ verse consequences of greatest concern include more mariju@@ an@@ a-@@ related road traffic accidents and deaths ; more psycho@@ ses and other serious mental health problems among heavy users ; and hea@@ vier marijuana use by young people , nega@@ tively affecting their life chances .
these effects , they argue , will more than off@@ set any gains from tax revenue and savings from law en@@ for@@ cement .
it is difficult to know who is right , because no other country has adopted this policy .
the netherlands , which is popul@@ arly believed to have leg@@ alized can@@ nab@@ is use along these lines , has in fact toler@@ ated only small-scale retail sales of marijuana in a limited number of coffee shops in its larger cities .
marijuana cultiv@@ ation remains illegal and coffee shop sales are regulated – more strictly in recent years in response to compla@@ ints from neighbor@@ ing countries about “ drug tourism . ”
nevertheless , some broad predictions can be made .
first , open@@ ly toler@@ ating a market in a previously illegal commodity will expand the number of users , especially if the retail price is lower than the black-@@ market price ( as is proposed in the am@@ mi@@ ano bill currently before the california legis@@ l@@ ature ) .
use may not increase immediately , but it will over time , because marijuana will become more freely available , much cheaper ( in order to dis@@ courage the persi@@ stence of a black market ) , and its use will be implic@@ itly con@@ don@@ ed .
experience with alcohol suggests that marijuana will be available to under@@ age users ( as it is now ) , whatever the minimum legal age .
thus , legally available cheaper marijuana will probably mean more use by more young people , and probably more daily use later into adul@@ thood . in general , the more people who use a drug , the larger the number of problem users there will be ( on the reasonable assumption that problem users com@@ prise a fixed proportion of all users ) .
if current estimates are correct , around 10 % of users ( and one in six who start in adolescence ) may become dependent on marijuana – that is , find it difficult to control or dis@@ continue their use .
a minority of these problem users will seek professional help to quit .
dependent marijuana users are more likely to experience road and workplace accidents ( if they drive or work while in@@ to@@ xic@@ ated ) ; increased respiratory disease ( if they smoke marijuana ) ; exac@@ er@@ ba@@ tions of some serious mental disorders ; and impaired school and work performance .
it is un@@ certain how far these ad@@ verse effects can be mi@@ tig@@ ated by pre@@ ven@@ tive measures such as imple@@ menting road@@ side dru@@ g-@@ testing programs , persu@@ ading users to use va@@ po@@ ri@@ zers rather than smoke jo@@ ints , dis@@ coura@@ ging young people from using marijuana , and encouraging early treatment for problem users .
experience with alcohol suggests that these approaches may mo@@ dest@@ ly reduce , but not eliminate , the har@@ ms associated with use , especially if sell@@ ers are allowed to promote their war@@ es .
indeed , the scale of any increase in marijuana use will critically depend on how tightly regulated marijuana sales are – how many licensed gro@@ wers there are , the number of sales out@@ lets , their locations and trading hours , eli@@ gi@@ bility requirements for use , content of th@@ c ( marijuana ’ s psycho@@ active ingredient ) , and how much promotion and advertising is allowed .
if marijuana were allowed to be market@@ ed much like alcohol is now , we could expect more problem users than if it were regulated more like pharmaceutical drugs ( say , by requ@@ ir@@ ing users to be licensed ; restri@@ cting the number of sales locations , hours of sale , and licensed gro@@ wers ; and im@@ posing high rates of tax@@ ation on hig@@ her@@ -@@ th@@ c marijuana ) .
it will be a major policy challenge to get this balance right .
greater restri@@ ctions would provide incentives for illegal oper@@ ators to remain , while less restri@@ ctive regulation would dis@@ courage black marke@@ te@@ ers , but at the price of increasing the number of users and problem users .
marijuana policy involves a choice between the ev@@ ils of current repres@@ sive policies and the ev@@ ils of increased use under a legal market .
califor@@ ni@@ ans will have to decide how much weight to give to respect for adult liberty , protection of min@@ ors , avoi@@ dance of a large-scale black market , fiscal consider@@ ations , and protection of marijuana users ’ health .
if they vote for leg@@ alization , it will probably be 20 years or more before anyone can say whether , on balance , they decided wi@@ sely .
princeton – when the earthquake and tsunami hit japan in march , brian tu@@ cker was in pa@@ dan@@ g , indonesia .
tu@@ cker was working with a colleague to design a refu@@ ge that could save thousands of lives if – or rather , when – a tsunami like the one in 17@@ 97 that came out of the indian ocean , some 600 miles southeast of where the 2004 asian tsunami origin@@ ated , strikes again .
tu@@ cker is the founder and president of geo@@ haz@@ ards international , a nonprofit organization whose mission is to reduce death and suffering due to earth@@ qu@@ akes in the world ’ s most vulnerable communities .
pa@@ dan@@ g is one of those communities .
just to its northwest , in b@@ anda ac@@ eh , 16@@ 0,000 lives were lost in the 2004 tsunami .
now , ge@@ ologists say , the fault that triggered that tsunami is most likely to rup@@ ture farther south , putting low-@@ lying coastal towns like pa@@ dan@@ g , with a population of 90@@ 0,000 , at high risk of a major earthquake and tsunami within the next 30 years .
in b@@ anda ac@@ eh , the tsunami killed more than half the city ’ s population .
in pa@@ dan@@ g , according to an estimate by the director of the city ’ s disaster management office , a similar tsunami could kill more than 400,000 people .
tu@@ cker says that he has stood on the beach in pa@@ dan@@ g , looking out at the ocean and trying to imagine what it would be like to see a five-@@ meter-@@ high wall of water stre@@ tching across the horizon , bearing down on the city .
now that we have seen the footage of the tsunami that hit japan , the demands on our imagination have been l@@ essen@@ ed – except that we have to imagine away the sea walls that japan had built to reduce the impact of the tsunami .
true , those walls did not work as well as had been hoped , but japan was nonetheless much better prepared for a tsunami than pa@@ dan@@ g is .
in pa@@ dan@@ g , even with advance warning of a tsunami , higher ground is too far away , and the narrow streets too cho@@ ked with traffic , for many people to get to safety in time .
geo@@ haz@@ ards international is therefore working on a more practical idea , which it calls a tsunami ev@@ acu@@ ation raised earth park ( ter@@ ep ) .
the idea is to build small hills in low-@@ lying parts of the city , with level tops that could be used as parks or sports fields .
with the few minutes ’ warning that an earthquake ’ s strong shaking would automatically provide , people could walk to a ter@@ ep and be safe above the highest level a tsunami could reach .
such raised earth parks are a low-cost solution to the tsunami danger in low-@@ lying coastal areas .
they use only local materials , provide a valuable community resource in normal times , and have the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives when a tsunami strikes .
nevertheless , geo@@ haz@@ ards international lac@@ ks the resources to build anything like enough ter@@ eps to meet the need .
after 20 years of operation , the organization remains tiny , especially when compared to organizations like the red cross , which primarily do disaster relief work .
people are willing to don@@ ate hundreds of millions of dollars to help people after a disaster – even after a disaster in a wealthy country like japan – but are un@@ willing to invest anything like the same amount to save lives before a predictable disaster strikes .
one reason for this is that preventing a disaster does not make good television .
people give to identifi@@ able victims .
if we build raised earth parks , we will never see the people who , but for our aid , would have died ; no orph@@ ans in desperate need will appear on the ni@@ ghtly news .
but isn ’ t it much better to keep parents safe than to help orph@@ ans after their parents have been killed ?
this is a situation in which we must stretch our imagination , to understand and be motivated by the good that we are doing .
unfortunately , not everyone can do that .
another reason why we do not give to prevent disasters should be familiar to anyone who has ever del@@ a@@ yed going to the dentist because the prospect of serious pain in the coming weeks or months just wasn ’ t as motiv@@ ating as the rel@@ uc@@ tance to face some more immediate slight dis@@ comfort .
we tell ourselves that maybe we won ’ t get a tooth@@ a@@ che after all , even though we know that the odds are that we will .
most of us are not very good at giving proper weight to future events , especially if they are un@@ certain .
so we may tell ourselves that the ge@@ ologists could be wrong , and perhaps no tsunami will hit pa@@ dan@@ g in the next 30 years , and by then perhaps we will have new and better technologies for predicting them , giving people more time to get to higher ground .
instead , we should be guided by the best estimates of the chances that an intervention will save lives , as well as by the number of lives that would be saved , and the cost of saving those lives .
the evidence suggests that building raised earth parks in places like pa@@ dan@@ g is very good value indeed .
when “ sovereig@@ n@@ ty ” risks global health
new york – here ’ s a concept you ’ ve probably never heard of : “ viral sovereig@@ n@@ ty . ”
this dangerous idea comes to us cour@@ tes@@ y of indonesia ’ s minister of health , si@@ ti fa@@ di@@ la@@ h su@@ par@@ i , who asser@@ ts that deadly viruses are the sovereig@@ n property of individual nations – even though they cross borders and could pose a pandemic threat to all the world ’ s peoples .
political leaders around the world should take note – and take very strong action .
the vast majority of avian flu out@@ breaks in the past four years , in both humans and po@@ ul@@ try , have occurred in indonesia .
yet , since 2005 , indonesia has shared with the who samples from only two of the more than 1@@ 35 people known to have been infected with h5n1 ( 110 of whom have died ) .
worse , indonesia is no longer providing the who with tim@@ ely noti@@ fication of bird flu out@@ breaks or human cases .
since 2007 , its government has open@@ ly de@@ fied international health regulations and a host of other who agre@@ ements to which indonesia is a sig@@ nat@@ ory .
moreover , indonesia ’ s government is threatening to close down united states na@@ val medical research unit two ( nam@@ ru@@ -@@ 2 ) , a public health laboratory sta@@ ffed by indones@@ ians and us military scientists .
nam@@ ru@@ -@@ 2 is one of the world ’ s best disease surveillance facilities , providing health officials worldwide with vital , transparent information .
indonesia ’ s government has accused nam@@ ru@@ -@@ 2 scientists of everything from prof@@ iting from its “ sovereig@@ n ” viruses to manufacturing the h5n1 bird flu as part of an alle@@ ged biological warfare scheme .
there is no evidence to support these out@@ land@@ ish claims .
a year ago , su@@ par@@ i ’ s asser@@ tions about “ viral sovereig@@ n@@ ty ” seemed anom@@ al@@ ous .
distur@@ b@@ ingly , however , the notion has morph@@ ed into a global movement , fu@@ eled by self-@@ destructive , anti-@@ western senti@@ ments .
in may , indian health minister an@@ bu@@ man@@ i ra@@ ma@@ do@@ ss end@@ or@@ sed the concept in a dispute with bangladesh , and the non-@@ alig@@ ned movement – a 1@@ 12-@@ nation organization that is a survivor of the cold war era – has agreed to consider form@@ ally end@@ or@@ sing it at its november meeting .
indonesia argues that a nation ’ s right to control all information on locally discovered viruses should be protected through the same mechanisms that the united nations food and agriculture organization uses to guarantee poor countries ’ rights of ownership and patents on the seeds of its indigenous plants .
under the fa@@ o seed accor@@ d , a nation can register plants , share their seeds , and deri@@ ve profits from resul@@ ting products .
this useful policy reduces explo@@ it@@ ative practices that sometimes enable multinational corporations and wealthy governments to ob@@ tain outrageous profits from indigenous agriculture .
it is dangerous fol@@ ly , however , to extend this policy to viruses .
if the concept of “ viral sovereig@@ n@@ ty ” had been applied to hiv 25 years ago , we would not have central reposit@@ ories of thousands of varieties of hiv today ; these allow scientists to test drugs and vaccines against all the different strains of the virus that causes aids .
it is even more lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous to extend the sovereig@@ n@@ ty notion to viruses that , like flu , can be carried across international borders by migr@@ atory birds .
in this age of globalization , failure to make viral samples freely available risks allowing the emergence of a new strain of influenza that could go un@@ noticed until it is capable of exac@@ ting the sort of toll taken by the pandemic that killed tens of millions in 1918 .
as the world learned with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) – which first appeared in china in 2002 but was not reported by chinese officials until it spread to four other nations – globally shared health risks demand absolute global transparency .
there is strong evidence from a variety of sources that forms of the bird flu virus circul@@ ating in indonesia are more virul@@ ent than those elsewhere and that in a few cases they may have spread directly from one person to another .
the who has tried for two years to accommo@@ date indonesia , without success .
under pressure from scientists worldwide , indonesia agreed in june to share genetic data on some of its viral samples , but not the actual microbes .
without access to the viruses , it is impossible to veri@@ fy the accuracy of such genetic information or to develop vaccines against the deadly microbes .
outrage@@ ously , su@@ par@@ i has charged that the who would give any viruses – not just h5n1 – to drug companies , which in turn would make products designed to si@@ cken poor people , in order “ to pro@@ long their profitable business by selling new vaccines ” ( a charge odd@@ ly remin@@ is@@ cent of the plot of john le car@@ r@@ é ’ s novel the constant gar@@ dener ) .
the who e@@ lic@@ ited ple@@ dges from the world ’ s major drug companies not to exploit international reposit@@ ories of genetic data for commercial benefit , but this has not satisfied indonesia .
indonesia ’ s claim that nam@@ ru@@ -@@ 2 is a biological weapons facility must be confronted head-@@ on .
the us ambassador to indonesia , cameron hu@@ me , is actively trying to prevent a catastrophe .
so far , there has been in@@ sufficient support from senior us officials .
they must get involved .
and china must use its substantial influence with indonesia on this issue – in its own self-interest .
failure to share potentially pandemic viral strains with world health agencies is morally re@@ pre@@ hen@@ sible .
allowing indonesia and other countries to turn this issue into another rich@@ -@@ poor , islam@@ ic@@ -@@ western dispute would be tragic – and could lead to a devastating health crisis anywhere and at any time .
when techno@@ pho@@ bia becomes toxic
stanford – during the late 1990 ’ s , a singular phenomenon appeared in countries around the world .
one after another , food and be@@ verage companies capit@@ ulated to activists opposed to a promising new technology : the genetic engineering of plants to produce ingredients .
they are still capit@@ ulating to this day .
the japanese bre@@ wer kir@@ in and the danish bre@@ wer carl@@ s@@ berg eliminated genetically engineered ingredients from their be@@ ers .
in the united states , the fast-@@ food giant mcdonald &apos;s banned them from its menu ; food manufacturers hein@@ z and ger@@ ber ( then a division of swi@@ tzer@@ land@@ -based nov@@ arti@@ s ) dropped them from their baby-@@ food lines ; and fri@@ to-@@ lay demand@@ ed that its gro@@ wers stop planting corn engineered to contain a bacterial protein that conf@@ ers resistance to insect pre@@ dation .
these measures were ration@@ alized in various ways , but the reality is that by yiel@@ ding to the demands of a min@@ us@@ cule number of dis@@ ingenu@@ ous activists , the companies op@@ ted to offer less safe products to consumers , thereby exposing themselves to legal je@@ opar@@ dy .
every year , in@@ numer@@ able packa@@ ge@@ d-@@ food products worldwide are with@@ held or rec@@ alled from the market due to the presence of “ all natural ” contamin@@ ants like insect parts , toxic mol@@ ds , bacteria , and viruses .
because farming takes place out@@ doors and in dirt , such cont@@ am@@ ination is a fact of life .
over the centuries , the main cul@@ pr@@ it in mass food poisoning often has been cont@@ am@@ ination of un@@ processed crops by fung@@ al toxins – a risk that is exac@@ erb@@ ated when insects attack food crops , opening wo@@ unds that allow fungi ( mol@@ ds ) to get a fo@@ oth@@ old .
for example , fum@@ on@@ is@@ in and some other fung@@ al toxins are highly toxic , causing es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al cancer in humans and fatal diseases in livestock that eat infected corn .
fum@@ on@@ is@@ in also interfer@@ es with the cellular up@@ take of fo@@ lic acid , a vitamin that reduces the risk of neural tube defe@@ cts in developing fet@@ uses , and thus can cause fo@@ lic acid defi@@ ci@@ ency – and defe@@ cts such as sp@@ ina bi@@ fi@@ da – even when one ’ s diet contains what otherwise would be sufficient amounts of the vitamin .
many regul@@ atory agencies have therefore established recommen@@ ded maximum fum@@ on@@ is@@ in levels per@@ mitted in food and feed products made from corn .
the conventional way to meet those standards and prevent the consumption of fung@@ al toxins is simply to test un@@ processed and processed grains and disc@@ ard those found to be contaminated – an approach that is both waste@@ ful and fail@@ u@@ re-@@ prone .
but modern technology – specifically , the genetic engineering of plants using re@@ combin@@ ant dna technology ( also known as food biotechnology or genetic modi@@ fication ) – offers a way to prevent the problem .
contrary to the claims of food-@@ biotech cri@@ tics , who insist that genetically modified crops pose risks ( none of which has actually occurred ) of new aller@@ gens or toxins in the food supply , such products offer the food industry a proven and practical means of tackling the fung@@ al cont@@ am@@ ination at its source .
an excellent example is corn that is crafted by sp@@ lic@@ ing into commercial varieties a gene ( or genes ) from a harm@@ less bacterium .
the bacterial genes express proteins that are toxic to cor@@ n-@@ boring insects , but that are harm@@ less to birds , fish , and mammals , including humans .
as the modified corn f@@ ends off insect pe@@ sts , it also reduces the levels of the mold f@@ us@@ arium , thereby reducing the levels of fum@@ on@@ is@@ in .
indeed , researchers at iowa state university and the us department of agriculture have found that the level of fum@@ on@@ is@@ in in the modified corn is reduced by as much as 80 % compared to conventional corn .
similarly , an italian study of we@@ an@@ ed pig@@ lets that were fed either conventional corn or the same variety modified to synthesize a bacterial protein that conf@@ ers resistance to insect pre@@ dation found that the modified variety contained lower levels of fum@@ on@@ is@@ in .
more importantly , the pig@@ lets that consumed the modified corn achieved a greater final weight , a measure of overall health , despite no difference in feed in@@ take between the two groups .
given the health benefits – to say nothing of the often higher and more reliable yields – governments should introduce incentives aimed at increasing use of such genetically engineered grains and other crops .
in addition , one would expect publi@@ c-@@ health advoc@@ ates to demand that such improved varieties be cultiv@@ ated and used for food , not unlike requirements that drinking water be chlor@@ in@@ ated and flu@@ ori@@ dated .
and food producers that are committed to offering the sa@@ fest and best products to their customers should be competing to get genetically engineered products into the marketplace .
activists continue to mount vocal and ten@@ acious opposition to genetically engineered foods , despite almost 20 years of demonstrated , significant benefits , including reduced use of chemical pesticides ( and thus less chemical run@@ off into water@@ ways ) , greater use of farming practices that prevent soil erosion , higher profits for farmers , and less fung@@ al cont@@ am@@ ination .
responding to the ble@@ ating of activists , policymakers have subje@@ cted the testing and commerci@@ alization of genetically engineered crops to uns@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic and dra@@ con@@ ian regulations , with di@@ re consequences .
a groundbreaking study of the political economy of agricultural biotechnology concluded that over-@@ regulation causes “ del@@ a@@ ys in the global diffusion of proven technologies , resul@@ ting in a lower rate of growth in the global food supply and higher food prices . ”
current policies also create “ dis@@ incentives for investing in further research and development , resul@@ ting in a slow@@ down in innovation of second-@@ generation technologies anticipated to introduce broad consumer and environmental benefits . ”
everyone involved in food production and consumption has suffered : consumers ( especially in developing countries ) have been subje@@ cted to avo@@ id@@ able health risks , and food producers have placed themselves in legal je@@ opar@@ dy for selling products known to have “ design defe@@ cts . ”
public policy that discrimin@@ ates against and dis@@ coura@@ ges vital innovations in food production is not policy that has the public ’ s interest at heart .
the world when the fed raises rates
vienna – the united states federal reserve is the world ’ s most powerful bank , and its most powerful component is the federal open market committee ( f@@ om@@ c ) , the twel@@ ve men and women who meet eight times a year to determine – essentially by setting interest rates – the mon@@ etary policy of the world ’ s largest economy .
the last time the fed raised interest rates was in 2006 , before the grow@@ th-@@ sa@@ pping impact of the global financial crisis persu@@ aded it and other central banks to lower rates effectively to zero and to employ so-called quantitative e@@ asing ( q@@ e ) to pump money into advanced economies .
but this year , for the first time since 2007 , every advanced economy in the world is growing – including america ’ s .
and that means that the f@@ om@@ c , fear@@ ful of asset bubbles , will at some point decide that america ’ s interest rates must rise .
that may ( or may not , depending on the timing ) be good for the us economy , but what will it mean for the rest of the world ?
our research shows why the world , especially emerging countries , will be paying nervous attention .
in mid-@@ 2013 , when the fed announced that it would gradually reduce its un@@ conventional mon@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ policy measures ( for example , large-scale purch@@ ases of mort@@ ga@@ ge-@@ backed se@@ curi@@ ties ) , emerging markets suffered large capital out@@ flows .
in other words , when the fed even hin@@ ts at ti@@ ghten@@ ing mon@@ etary policy , other countries suffer .
depending on just how much the f@@ om@@ c decides to ti@@ gh@@ ten at a future meeting , we fores@@ ee negative effects on world gdp in the medium term , not only for emerging markets but also for industrialized economies .
since the fed started to cur@@ b its q@@ e program , there has been constant specu@@ lation over just when its current accommo@@ da@@ tive mon@@ etary policy will end .
market participants , be they len@@ ders or bor@@ ro@@ wers , know that “ easy money ” has an exp@@ ir@@ y date .
they can see that after three large asse@@ t-@@ purchase programs , the fed ’ s balance sheet has more than quad@@ ru@@ pled since 2007 , tot@@ aling about $ 4.@@ 5 trillion in february 2015 .
however , when ass@@ essing what the f@@ om@@ c inten@@ ds to do , it is important to bear in mind that the fed ’ s mandate is to advance america ’ s national economic goals .
this means that it has to consider not just the des@@ ir@@ able rate of inflation ( the target is a 2 % annual rate ) , but also the state of the labor market – and its judgment has global implications .
that is why the fed ’ s talk in mid-@@ 2013 about a gradu@@ al exit from un@@ conventional mon@@ etary policy led to a so-called “ ta@@ per tan@@ trum ” among investors , trig@@ gering a surge in global vola@@ tili@@ ty and a shift in market senti@@ ment against emerging markets .
the question now is whether future changes by the f@@ om@@ c in the federal funds rate ( the interest rate at which banks l@@ end each other their overnight money depos@@ ited at the fed ) will have similar , or indeed worse , effects .
to narrow any gap between its expectations for the economy and those of the public , the fed publi@@ shes each f@@ om@@ c member ’ s view of the range of interest rates that should be expected over the next few years .
a member with a positive assessment of the us economy ’ s growth pro@@ spe@@ cts will expect a rise in the federal funds rate ; a pessi@@ mist will expect the rate to stay close to zero for a longer period .
using information released by the fed in march , we have constructed two scenarios : “ li@@ ft-@@ off ” is based on the maximum projected interest rates , while “ del@@ a@@ yed li@@ ft-@@ off ” is based on the minimum .
to see the impact beyond america on gdp , consumer prices , exchange rates , and interest rates , we then apply the scenarios to a total of 36 emerging and advanced economies that together account for 90 % of global output .
assuming a ph@@ ased rise in the federal funds rate to 4 % by 20@@ 17 , we believe that economic growth in all regions except latin america will slow in 20@@ 16 , and then slow even more in 20@@ 17 .
the cumulative loss in this “ li@@ ft-@@ off ” scenario is about ten times as large as any lost economic output under the “ del@@ a@@ yed li@@ ft-@@ off ” alternative of only minimal changes to rates over the next couple of years .
our research shows that any mon@@ etary ti@@ ghten@@ ing by the fed will affect the rest of the world , but to differ@@ ing degrees . those emerging markets that were hit severely during the “ ta@@ per tan@@ trum ” episode – for example , brazil , indonesia , and turkey – will certainly suffer .
but the greatest negative impact will be on countries such as canada and mexico , which have close trade links with the us economy or those , like germany , japan , and singapore , that are deeply integrated into the global economy .
in other words , though emerging markets – through their dependence on capital in@@ flows – will be at risk when america ’ s mon@@ etary policy eventually returns to “ normal , ” the same will be true for advanced economies .
this commentary reflects the authors ’ personal views , not those of the o@@ est@@ erreich@@ ische national@@ bank or the euro@@ system .
ready for a us rate hi@@ ke ?
man@@ ila – the possibility that the us federal reserve could raise the interest rate for the first time in a decade sent j@@ it@@ ters across emerging markets for weeks .
though the fed has now decided to keep its policy rate ‎ un@@ changed , it also stated that a rate hi@@ ke is still on the table for 2015 .
the concern is that countries that are dependent on foreign finan@@ cing could be hit by sudden out@@ flows of international capital , or that currency de@@ preci@@ ation following the fed hi@@ ke could raise deb@@ t-@@ servi@@ cing costs for countries and businesses .
governments in the developing world would be wise to worry less about interest@@ -@@ rate changes in the united states – which , in any case , they cannot control – and think more about policy changes they can make at home to streng@@ then their economies ’ resilience .
an increase in us interest rates is not necessarily bad news for emerging countries .
many developing countries – especially in asia – are in much better macro@@ economic shape than they were just before the asian financial crisis of the late 1990s or at the onset of the 2008 global financial crisis .
and the fed is likely to raise rates only if it judges us economic growth to be strong and sustainable , which would be a positive sign for the global economy in general .
furthermore , a delay in raising rates carries its own dangers , encouraging yiel@@ d-@@ hungry investors to take larger risks – possibly necessi@@ tating a shar@@ per or more ab@@ rupt change in interest rates in the future .
emerging countries can enhance their resilience to fluctuations in global interest rates by pursuing sound fiscal and mon@@ etary policies , continuing necessary structural reforms , and streng@@ th@@ ening their financial systems .
in particular , recent research suggests four key policy areas in which governments should consider interven@@ ing .
for star@@ ters , countries should embrace policies that favor foreign direct investment ( f@@ di ) over in@@ flows that can be with@@ drawn more quickly , such as foreign bank loans , debt , or equity investments .
my research with hu@@ i t@@ ong of the international mon@@ etary fund shows that countries whose capital in@@ flows that are mainly in the form of f@@ di tend to be more resilient to foreign financial sho@@ cks .
when the global financial crisis erup@@ ted , countries with high f@@ di relative to total capital flows ten@@ ded to experience a less severe liqui@@ dity crun@@ ch .
second , exchange rates need to reflect economic fundament@@ als .
but while theory suggests that flexible exchange rates should bl@@ unt foreign mon@@ etary or financial sho@@ cks , in practice , such a currency regime rarely works on its own .
indeed , my research with the asian development bank ’ s x@@ ue@@ hu@@ i han has shown that when the us raises or lo@@ wers interest rates , most developing countries tend to follow suit , even when they have a flexible exchange rate .
the key reason is that they want to avoid large s@@ wings in the value of their currency .
appreciation can harm competi@@ tiveness , while de@@ preci@@ ation increases the cost of servi@@ cing foreig@@ n-@@ currency debt , ero@@ des market confidence , and leads to higher inflation .
the not@@ able exceptions to this trend are countries that manage cross-@@ border capital flows , especially the corporate sector ’ s exposure to foreig@@ n-@@ currency debt .
indeed , certain types of capit@@ al-@@ flow management – including limit@@ ing domestic debt denomin@@ ated in foreign currency for both firms and households – have been shown to increase resilience .
third , domestic macro@@ p@@ ru@@ den@@ tial and micro@@ p@@ ru@@ den@@ tial policies increase resilience .
these policies should aim at reducing or eliminating the we@@ dge between activities that are good for individuals , banks , and firms , and those that benefit society as a whole .
one example of such a policy is to link banks ’ mand@@ atory reserve rati@@ os to the speed at which credit is expanding or to the stage of the business cycle .
thus , during periods of expansion , when banks are eager to fund ever more risky bor@@ ro@@ wers , the reserve ratio rises , cur@@ bing potentially disruptive asset bubbles or over@@ investment .
for those countries capable of designing and imple@@ menting p@@ ru@@ den@@ tial regulations , management of cross-@@ border capital flows becomes less useful and less des@@ ir@@ able .
finally , it is no longer appropriate to judge whether a country ’ s foreig@@ n-@@ currency reserves are adequate based on how many months of impor@@ ts they can cover .
instead , the question to ask is whether the reserves can comfort@@ ably service the public and private sectors ’ debt denomin@@ ated in foreign curren@@ cies .
the us will norm@@ alize its interest rate policy sooner or later according to its need .
for other countries , it is important to focus on policies that can streng@@ then resilience to foreign financial or mon@@ etary sho@@ cks .
when will we win the war against cancer ?
thir@@ ty years ago america &apos;s president declared `@@ `@@ war on cancer &apos; &apos; .
this year , in the us alone , 1,500 men , women and children lose their personal battle with cancer every day .
when will the war end ?
i believe that for many cancers the war will end soon .
thanks to knowledge from basic research , we have new tools with which to attack cancer .
these new tools are providing more rapid diagnosis and more effective treatments .
they are producing new drugs that target molecular changes unique to cancer cells , making it possible to predict who may be at risk for developing cancer because of genetic or environmental factors .
these advances will save many lives .
cancer affects many different organs and tissues in the body .
although cancers differ greatly in their appearance and behavior , they have a common cause : damage to genes .
genes are chemical coding units that speci@@ fy the structure and function of our bodies .
all the cells in our bodies have the same comple@@ ment of genes , half from each of our parents .
what makes one kind of cell different from another is the combination of genes that are active in each cell .
genes can be damaged by environmental factors , such as radiation or chemicals .
they can also be damaged by the products of normal metabolism .
our bodies have elaborate repair systems that maintain the integrity of our genes , even in the presence of dama@@ ging agents .
occasionally , however , damage is not re@@ paired .
if the damage occurs in key genes that regulate cell growth , cancer can develop .
the repair systems themselves help protect us from cancer .
for example , one kind of col@@ on cancer develops more frequently in individuals who have a defe@@ ct in a system that re@@ pairs damaged genes .
cell growth is regulated by a balance between genes that stimulate growth , and those that inhi@@ bit it .
when on@@ co@@ genes are activated , or tumor supp@@ res@@ sor genes disabled , cells can multiply out of control .
on@@ co@@ genes can be activated by mutation ( changes in gene structure ) or by gene ampli@@ fication ( production of many copies of a gene ) .
tumor supp@@ res@@ sor genes can be disabled by mutation , or by spontaneous loss during cell division .
cancer cells are genetically unstable , that is , they have abnormal numbers of chromosomes , the cellular elements that carry genes .
genetic inst@@ ability contributes to loss of growth control by producing im@@ balances in gene activity .
traditionally cancer has been diagnosed by the characteristic appearance of cancer cells observed through a microscope .
increasingly , cancers are identified by their characteristic patterns of gene activity ( their `@@ `@@ molecular signature &apos; &apos; ) .
new techniques , including `@@ `@@ gene chips &apos; &apos; , have made it possible to measure the activity of thousands of genes simultaneously .
the molecular sig@@ natur@@ es can be used to classi@@ fy cancers more precisely , making them easier to treat .
for example , these techniques have been used to identify some kinds of lymph@@ om@@ as ( cancers of the blood ) that respond well to chemotherapy .
similar techniques have been used to identify genes involved in tumor metast@@ asis .
some genetic changes are common to many types of cancer , whereas other changes are specific to particular cancers .
dozens of on@@ co@@ genes and tumor supp@@ res@@ sor genes have been identified , providing targets for the development of new anti-@@ cancer drugs .
a striking recent example is a drug that targets a molecular change characteristic of chronic my@@ el@@ ogen@@ ous leu@@ ke@@ mia cells .
the drug is providing an alternative to bone marrow transplantation , the only treatment that was effective previously .
mutations in certain genes have been found to cause her@@ edi@@ tary forms of breast and o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
this has made it possible to identify women who may be at high risk because they inher@@ it these sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility genes .
( inherited forms of breast and o@@ vari@@ an cancer are only a small fraction of the total . )
close observation and rapid treatment , or pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic surgery , can reduce the risk of these inherited forms of cancer .
advances in imaging techniques are making it possible to detect cancer earlier , which can help eliminate tumors before they become life-@@ threatening .
new imaging techniques are also helping to guide surgery , so that tumors can be removed more precisely .
other leads are emerging from a better understanding of how tumors grow .
tumors need a pl@@ enti@@ ful blood supply , so they produce factors that indu@@ ce the formation of blood vessels ( a process called angiogenesis ) .
new drugs , which have been designed to inhi@@ bit tumor angiogenesis , are showing promise in clinical trials .
it is estimated that 10-@@ 15 % of cancer worldwide is associated with viral infection .
liver cancer , which is associated with he@@ pati@@ tis , and cer@@ vi@@ cal cancer , associated with human pa@@ pill@@ oma virus infection , are promin@@ ent examples .
a vaccine against he@@ pati@@ tis b virus is proving to be effective in reducing the inci@@ dence of liver cancer .
rapid and specific diagnostic tests for the human pa@@ pill@@ oma virus are supp@@ le@@ menting traditional pa@@ p tests , helping to identify women at risk for cer@@ vi@@ cal cancer .
one of the most intriguing discoveries of modern biology is that cell death is inti@@ mately involved with growth and development .
for example , nerve cells are produced in excess , and some die in order for proper connections to be established in the nervous system .
cells contain a `@@ `@@ suicide program &apos; &apos; that is activated when the cells are damaged beyond repair .
intrigu@@ ingly , cancer cells respond ab@@ normally to death signals .
a promising approach now being explored for treating cancer is to activate the suicide program of cancer cells without disturbing normal cells .
although the future cannot be predicted with as@@ sur@@ ance , it seems reasonable to expect that the burden of cancer will be reduced substan@@ tially in the next ten years by new treatments .
for some cancers , like liver cancer and chronic my@@ el@@ ogen@@ ous leu@@ ke@@ mia mentioned , this is already happening .
for other cancers , the means for prevention are at hand , but the application is proble@@ ma@@ tical , as in the case of lung cancer caused by cigarette smoking .
it is unlikely that most cancers will disappear in the near future ; rather they will be diagnosed more precisely and treated more effectively , thereby increasing the number of people who can be cu@@ red .
when women lead
mun@@ ich – would the world be more peaceful if women were in charge ?
a challenging new book by the harvard university psychologist steven pinker says that the answer is “ yes . ”
in the better angels of our nature , pinker presents data showing that human violence , while still very much with us today , has been gradually declining .
moreover , he says , “ over the long swe@@ ep of history , women have been and will be a paci@@ fying force .
skep@@ tics immediately rep@@ ly that women have not made war simply because they have rarely been in power .
if they were empowered as leaders , the conditions of an an@@ arch@@ ic world would force them to make the same bel@@ li@@ co@@ se decisions that men do .
margaret th@@ at@@ cher , gol@@ da mei@@ r , and indi@@ ra gandhi were powerful women ; all of them led their countries to war .
but it is also true that these women rose to leadership by playing according to the political rules of “ a man ’ s world . ”
it was their success in con@@ forming to male values that enabled their rise to leadership in the first place .
in a world in which women held a proportion@@ ate share ( one-@@ half ) of leadership positions , they might behave differently in power .
so we are left with the broader question : does gender really matter in leadership ?
in terms of stereotypes , various psychological studies show that men gravi@@ tate to the hard power of command , while women are collaborative and intuitively understand the soft power of attraction and persu@@ asion .
americans tend to describe leadership with tough male stereotypes , but recent leadership studies show increased success for what was once considered a “ feminine style . ”
in information@@ -based societies , networks are replacing hierarch@@ ies , and knowledge workers are less de@@ fer@@ ential .
management in a wide range of organizations is changing in the direction of “ shared leadership , ” and “ distributed leadership , ” with leaders in the center of a circle rather than at@@ op a pyramid .
former google ceo eric sch@@ mid@@ t said that he had to “ co@@ ddle ” his employees .
even the military faces these changes .
in the united states , the pentagon says that army dri@@ ll@@ masters do “ less shouting at everyone , ” because today ’ s generation responds better to instruc@@ tors who play “ a more counsel@@ ing-@@ type role . ”
former us president george w. bush once described his role as “ the deci@@ der , ” but there is much more to modern leadership than that .
modern leaders must be able to use networks , to collaborate , and to encourage participation .
women ’ s non-@@ hierarch@@ ical style and relational skills fit a leadership need in the new world of knowled@@ ge-@@ based organizations and groups that men , on average , are less well prepared to meet .
in the past , when women fought their way to the top of organizations , they often had to adopt a “ ma@@ scul@@ ine style , ” viol@@ ating the broader social norm of female “ ni@@ cen@@ ess . ”
now , however , with the information revolution and democra@@ tization demanding more participatory leadership , the “ feminine style ” is becoming a path to more effective leadership .
in order to lead successfully , men will not only have to value this style in their women colleagues , but will also have to master the same skills .
that is a trend , not ( yet ) a fact .
women still lag in leadership positions , holding only 5 % of top corporate positions and a minority of positions in elected legis@@ l@@ atures ( just 16 % in the us , for example , compared to 45 % in sweden ) .
one study of the 1,@@ 9@@ 41 rul@@ ers of independent countries during the twen@@ tieth century found only 27 women , roughly half of whom came to power as wi@@ dows or daughters of a male rul@@ er .
less than 1 % of twen@@ ti@@ eth@@ -@@ century rul@@ ers were women who gained power on their own .
so , given the new conventional wisdom in leadership studies that entering the information age means entering a woman ’ s world , why are women not doing better ?
lack of experience , primary caregi@@ ver responsibilities , bar@@ gaining style , and plain old discrimin@@ ation all help to explain the gender gap .
traditional career paths , and the cultural norms that constructed and rein@@ forced them , simply have not enabled women to gain the skills required for top leadership positions in many organi@@ zational contexts .
research shows that even in democratic societies , women face a higher social risk than men when attemp@@ ting to negotiate for care@@ er-@@ related resources such as compen@@ sation .
women are generally not well integrated into male networks that dominate organizations , and gender stereotypes still ham@@ per women who try to overcome such barriers .
this bias is beginning to break down in information@@ -based societies , but it is a mistake to identify the new type of leadership we need in an information age simply as “ a woman ’ s world . ”
even positive stereotypes are bad for women , men , and effective leadership .
leaders should be viewed less in terms of heroic command than as encouraging participation throughout an organization , group , country , or network .
questions of appropriate style – when to use hard and soft skills – are equally relevant for men and women , and should not be clou@@ ded by traditional gender stereotypes .
in some circumstances , men will need to act more “ like women ” ; in others , women will need to be more “ like men . ”
the key choices about war and peace in our future will depend not on gender , but on how leaders combine hard@@ - and soft@@ -@@ power skills to produce smart strategies .
both men and women will make those decisions .
but pinker is probably correct when he notes that the parts of the world that lag in the decline of violence are also the parts that lag in the empowerment of women .
when yes means no
most comm@@ ent@@ ators routinely assume that a yes vote in the may 29 french refer@@ end@@ um on the proposed european union constitution would be good for europe and the eu .
but there is reason to doubt the conventional wisdom .
the french refer@@ end@@ um will determine the political fate of french president jacques chi@@ ra@@ c – not france ’ s commitment to europe , which is fixed and im@@ mu@@ table .
if the french vote no , m. chi@@ ra@@ c is finished .
europe clearly would be better off with chi@@ ra@@ c weak@@ ened than streng@@ th@@ ened , even if it means a temporary slowing of the pace of integration .
chi@@ ra@@ c practices the politics of “ sc@@ ape@@ go@@ a@@ tism ” and excuses .
according to chi@@ ra@@ c , france ’ s exports are la@@ gging not because france is losing its international competi@@ tiveness – although it is , especially to germany – but because of the strong euro .
likewise , france ’ s economic growth is wan@@ ing not because france has failed to under@@ take necessary structural reforms , but because european interest rates are too high .
who does chi@@ ra@@ c think is at fault ?
the european central bank , of course , for allowing the euro to appreciate too much and for not cutting interest rates enough .
unfortunately , this is typical of chi@@ ra@@ c ’ s leadership style : blame others , excuse yourself , and ignore reform .
this is hardly the type of leadership europe needs to survive and prosp@@ er in the modern world .
but europe will get more of it if the french vote yes .
europe also would continue to be dominated by the interests of the big countries , with the small countries in the back of the bus .
the fate of the fran@@ co-@@ german axis , in particular , hing@@ es on the outcome of the refer@@ end@@ um .
a yes invi@@ gor@@ ates the axis ; a no weak@@ ens it .
the prospect of a re-@@ energi@@ zed fran@@ co-@@ german axis is why the dutch – who are traditionally pro-@@ european but do not want a europe that margin@@ alizes small countries – might vote no in their refer@@ end@@ um ( which follows shortly upon france ’ s ) if the french vote yes .
a dutch no would signal reje@@ ction of a corpo@@ rati@@ st europe dominated by french and german interests , as well as representing a protest against the un@@ popular conservative and mor@@ alistic policies of the bal@@ ken@@ ende government .
france is not the only eu country with an un@@ popular leader .
eastern europe also has a big stake in the outcome of the french refer@@ end@@ um .
chi@@ ra@@ c made it perfectly clear how he feels about the new smaller countries when he told them to “ shut up ” when they dis@@ agreed with him over iraq .
more recently , chi@@ ra@@ c ’ s foreign minister , michel bar@@ nier , cha@@ st@@ ised the ro@@ manian president tra@@ ian bar@@ es@@ c@@ u for lac@@ king a “ european reflex , ” because bar@@ es@@ c@@ u plans to alig@@ n roman@@ ia with an@@ glo@@ -@@ sa@@ xon liberal economic policies , and wants a special relationship with the us and uk to improve security in the black sea region .
rather than buck@@ le to france ’ s will , however , the ro@@ manian president war@@ ned france ’ s leaders to stop lec@@ turing his country – a sure sign that french influence is on the wan@@ e even in countries with which it has had close historical ties .
a french no would sit well with the union ’ s ne@@ wer members from eastern europe , who know chi@@ ra@@ c is not their friend , and who are more attracted by promises of rapid economic growth than social protection and corporate state mis@@ chief .
finally , the refer@@ end@@ um contains an un@@ stated question about the future of european mon@@ etary union ( em@@ u ) and the euro .
the yes camp argues that reje@@ cting the constitution would damage the european central bank ( ec@@ b ) and the euro .
but why would the eu fall into chaos and the euro wi@@ lt if the treaty of nice remains in force .
in the area of mon@@ etary integration , the european constitution doesn ’ t change anything , other than the voting procedures in the gover@@ ning council if em@@ u grows beyond 15 member countries .
a yes vote , on the other hand , would encourage a reas@@ su@@ red chi@@ ra@@ c to continue his policy of no reform and sc@@ ape@@ go@@ ating the ec@@ b .
external political pressure on the ec@@ b and its president , jean-@@ c@@ lau@@ de tri@@ ch@@ et , to lower interest rates and talk the euro down surely would increase .
this is more likely to bring the euro down than a no vote .
where are europe &apos;s optimi@@ sts ?
the european union has been so successful that you would have thought there would be dancing in the streets at its 50th anniversary .
al@@ as , there has been only persistent talk of failure – to achieve political union , to adopt a constitution , to exercise global leadership and vision , to implement economic reforms , and the list of lam@@ ents goes on . “ the eu is on autop@@ il@@ ot , in stal@@ e@@ mate , in deep crisis , ” claims jo@@ sch@@ ka fischer , the former german foreign minister and an important voice in europe .
but this angst and hand-@@ wr@@ inging simply is not convincing .
after world war ii , it was a beaten and devastated nation with a history of dys@@ functional nation@@ alism . today , a totally rehabili@@ tated germany is as thorough@@ ly european and democratic as any other eu nation – indeed , under the leadership of angel@@ a mer@@ kel , germany has earned its place as europe ’ s most important country .
the eu deserves great credit for this transformation .
after the war , it was a prime eu objective to moder@@ ate nation@@ alism and promote region@@ alism in germany , a fe@@ at that was accomplished to the benefit of all europeans .
shouldn ’ t they – and others – be celebrating this major success instead of becoming bo@@ gged down in defe@@ ati@@ st talk of crisis and stal@@ e@@ mate ?
besides , where is the alle@@ ged crisis and stal@@ e@@ mate ?
on the economic front , the euro@@ -@@ zone economy performed extremely well in 2006 , and most experts predict that economic growth in 2007 will be faster in europe than in the united states , not@@ with@@ standing germany ’ s hef@@ ty increase in valu@@ e-@@ added tax .
even more impressive , the lack of full political union in europe has not stal@@ e@@ mated the eu ’ s adoption of the euro and the common mon@@ etary policy .
on the contrary , the quick international acceptance of the euro as one of the world ’ s premi@@ er curren@@ cies , ai@@ ded by the european central bank ’ s determination to keep inflation under control , indicates that the mon@@ etary project is going full steam ahead .
currently , the euro is streng@@ th@@ ening against the us dollar , because central banks in asia and the middle east are increasing the euro component of their foreign exchange reserves – a clear vote of confidence in the new currency and the ec@@ b .
both the success of the euro and the smooth functioning of the common mon@@ etary policy show that important “ european ” projects can be accomplished even without the benefit of full political union .
while the eu ’ s member states have proved themselves capable of putting aside their differences when for@@ ging a common mon@@ etary policy , a common foreign policy has proved more elu@@ sive .
on issues like the iraq war and american plans to install missile defen@@ ses in poland and the c@@ ze@@ ch republic , europeans appear to find it difficult to speak with a single voice .
the reason is clear : europe remains too dependent on the us for its defense needs .
some eu members ( germany and italy ) are more dependent on the us than others ( france ) , and thus more likely to support us strategic initi@@ atives .
so long as these differences remain , so will europe ’ s political di@@ visions .
but defense independence vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis us impli@@ es a vast re-@@ allo@@ cation of resources from social welfare programs to the military , which so far has not interested the europeans .
rather than reflecting a lack of political will to come together and speak with a single voice on strategic issues – the conventional interpretation – diverse voices are the result of an implic@@ it choice that europeans make .
many europeans have decided that it is better to keep their robust social welfare programs and for@@ go a common foreign and defense policy , which would require massive changes in the european way of life .
thus , when jo@@ s@@ é zap@@ ater@@ o and the soci@@ alists took control of spain ’ s government from the conservatives , the country ’ s foreign policy changed from supporting the americans in iraq to op@@ posing them .
( but , interestingly , the switch from sil@@ vi@@ o ber@@ lus@@ con@@ i to roman@@ o pro@@ di in italy is having a less dramatic effect on italy ’ s foreign policy because of the country ’ s greater defense dependence on the us . )
naturally , with soci@@ alists and social democrats in power in some eu countries , and conservatives in power in others , it is difficult for europeans to find a single voice .
this may change if a new common threat to europe emerges , or if conservative parties follow the left and become anti-@@ american .
given us president george w. bush ’ s extreme un@@ popul@@ arity in europe , the emergence of an anti-@@ american right should no longer be considered a remote possibility .
but with europe enjoying an unprecedented level of economic prosperity as a result of the eu ’ s dramatic accompli@@ sh@@ ments during its first 50 years , further political uni@@ fication clearly can wait .
congratu@@ lations , not hand-@@ wr@@ inging , should be the order of the day .
where are the global leaders ?
the g-@@ 8 summit in japan earlier this month was a painful demonstration of the pi@@ ti@@ ful state of global cooperation .
the world is in dee@@ pen@@ ing crisis .
food prices are so@@ aring . oil prices are at historic high@@ s .
the leading economies are entering a recession .
climate change negotiations are going around in circles . aid to the poorest countries is stag@@ nant , despite years of promised increases .
and yet in this gathering storm it was hard to find a single real accompli@@ shment by the world ’ s leaders .
the world needs global solutions for global problems , but the g-@@ 8 leaders clearly cannot provide them .
because virtually all of the political leaders that went to the summit are deeply un@@ popular at home , few offer any global leadership .
they are weak individually , and even weaker when they get together and display to the world their inability to mobili@@ ze real action .
there are four deep problems .
the first is the in@@ coher@@ ence of american leadership .
while we are well past the time when the united states alone could solve any global problems , it does not even try to find shared global solutions .
the will to global cooperation was weak even in the clinton administration , but it has disappeared entirely during the bush administration .
the second problem is the lack of global finan@@ cing .
the hunger crisis can be overcome in poor countries if they get help to grow more food .
the global energy and climate crises can be overcome if the world invest@@ s together to develop new energy technologies .
diseases such as malaria can be overcome through globally coordinated investments in disease control .
the oceans , rainforests , and air can be kept safe through po@@ ol@@ ed investments in environmental protection .
global solutions are not expensive , but they are not free , either .
global solutions to poverty , food production , and development of new clean energy technology will require annual investments of roughly $ 350 billion , or 1 % of gn@@ p of the rich world .
this is obviously affordable , and is modest compared to military spending , but is far above the pit@@ tance that the g-@@ 8 actually brings to the table to solve these urgent challenges .
british prime minister gordon brown has made a vali@@ ant effort to get the rest of europe to honor the modest aid ple@@ dges made at the g-@@ 8 summit in 2005 , but it has been a tough fight , and one that hasn ’ t been won .
the third problem is the dis@@ connection between global scientific expertise and politicians .
scientists and engineers have developed many powerful ways to address today ’ s challenges , whether growing food , controlling diseases , or protecting the environment .
and these methods have become even more powerful in recent years with advances in information and communications technology , which make global solutions easier to identify and implement than ever before .
the fourth problem is that the g-@@ 8 ignor@@ es the very international institutions – not@@ ably the united nations and the world bank – that offer the best hope to implement global solutions .
these institutions are often depri@@ ved of political bac@@ king , under@@ finan@@ ced , and then bl@@ amed by the g-@@ 8 when global problems aren ’ t solved .
instead , they should be given clear authority and responsibilities , and then held accountable for their performance .
president bush may be too unaware to recognize that his historically high 70 % dis@@ approval rating among us voters is related to the fact that his government turned its back on the international community – and thereby got trapped in war and economic crisis .
the other g-@@ 8 leaders presumably can see that their own un@@ popul@@ arity at home is strongly related to high food and energy prices , and an increasingly unstable global climate and global economy , none of which they can address on their own .
starting in january 2009 with the new us president , politicians should take the best chance for their own political survival , and of course for their countries ’ well-being , by rein@@ vi@@ gor@@ ating global cooperation .
they should agree to address shared global goals , including the fight against poverty , hunger , and disease ( the millennium development goals ) , as well as climate change and environmental destruction .
to achieve these goals , the g-@@ 8 should set clear ti@@ me@@ tables for action , and transparent agre@@ ements on how to fund it .
the smartest move would be to agree that each country tax its co2 emissions in order to reduce climate change , and then devote a fixed amount of the proce@@ eds to global problem solving .
with the funding assu@@ red , the g-@@ 8 would suddenly move from empty promises to real policies .
backed by adequate funding , the world ’ s political leaders should turn to the expert scientific community and international organizations to help implement a truly global effort .
rather than regar@@ ding the un and its agencies as competitors or threats to national sovereig@@ n@@ ty , they should recognize that working with the un agencies is in fact the only way to solve global problems , and therefore is the key to their own political survival .
these basic steps – agre@@ eing on global goals , mobili@@ zing the finan@@ cing needed to meet them , and identi@@ fying the scientific expertise and organizations needed to implement solutions – is basic management logic .
some may sco@@ ff that this approach is impossible at the global level , because all politics are local .
yet today , all politicians depend on global solutions for their own political survival .
that by itself could make solutions that now seem out of reach common@@ place in the future .
time is short , since global problems are moun@@ ting rapidly .
the world is passing through the greatest economic crisis in decades .
it ’ s time to say to the g-@@ 8 leaders , “ get your act together , or don ’ t even bother to meet next year . ” it ’ s too embarrassing to watch grown men and women gather for empty photo opportunities .
where are the global problem sol@@ vers ?
new york – one odd and disturbing aspect of global politics today is the con@@ fusion between negotiations and problem-@@ solving .
according to a ti@@ me@@ table agreed in december 2007 , we have six months to reach a global agreement on climate change in copenhagen .
governments are engaged in a massive negotiation , but they are not engaged in a massive effort at problem-@@ solving .
each country asks itself , “ how do i do the least and get the other countries to do the most ? , ” when they should be asking instead , “ how do we cooperate to achieve our shared goals at minimum cost and maximum benefit ? ”
these might sound like the same thing , but they are not .
addressing the problem of climate change requires reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels , which in turn involves choices in technology , some of which already exists and much of which needs to be developed .
for example , coal plants , if they are to remain a major part of the energy mix , will need to capture and store their co2 , a process called “ carbon capture and sequest@@ ration , ” or c@@ cs for short .
yet this technology remains un@@ proved .
similarly , we will need rene@@ wed public confidence in a new generation of nuclear power , with plants that are safe and reli@@ ably monit@@ ored .
we will need new technologies to mobili@@ ze large-scale solar power , wind power , and ge@@ other@@ mal power .
we might try to tap bio-@@ fuels , but only in forms that do not compete with food supplies or with precious environmental assets .
the list goes on .
we will need improved energy efficiency , through “ green buildings ” and more efficient appliances .
we will need to switch from cars with intern@@ al-@@ com@@ bu@@ stion engines to hybri@@ ds , plu@@ g-@@ in hybri@@ ds , bat@@ ter@@ y-@@ powered , and fu@@ el-@@ cell@@ -@@ powered vehicles .
achieving a new generation of electric vehicles will require a decade of public and private partnership to achieve basic technological development ( such as improved batteries ) , a more robust electric grid , new infrastructure for re-@@ charging the automobiles , and much more .
similarly , it will take a decade of public and private investments to demonstrate the feasi@@ bility of co@@ al-@@ fired plants that capture their carbon dioxide .
the swi@@ tch@@ over to new technologies is not mainly a matter of negotiation but of engineering , planning , finan@@ cing , and incentives .
how can the world most effectively develop , demonstrate , and then spread these new technologies ?
where the benefits are unlikely to acc@@ ru@@ e to private investors , who should pay for the early demonstration models , which will require billions of dollars ?
how should we preserve private incentives for research and development while commit@@ ting to transfer successful technologies to developing countries ?
these are pressing , uns@@ ol@@ ved questions .
yet the global negotiations on climate change are focusing on a different set of questions .
the negotiations are mainly about which groups of countries should cut their emissions , by how much , how fast , and relative to which baseline year .
countries are being pres@@ sed to cut emissions by 2020 by certain percentage targets , without much serious discussion about how the cuts can be achieved .
the answers depend , of course , on which low-@@ emission technologies will be available , and on how fast they can be deployed .
consider the united states .
to cut emissions shar@@ ply , the us will need to switch over this decade to a new fleet of automobiles , powered increasingly by electricity .
the us will also have to decide on the renew@@ al and expansion of its nuclear power plants , and on the use of public lands to build new renewable energy plants , especially using solar power .
and the us will need a new power grid to carry renewable energy from low-@@ density population sites – such as the south@@ western deserts for solar power and the northern pla@@ ins for wind power – to the high-@@ density populations of the co@@ a@@ sts .
yet all of this requires a national plan , not simply a numer@@ ical target for emissions reduction .
similarly , china , like the us , can reduce co2 emissions through increased energy efficiency and a new fleet of electric vehicles .
but china must consider the question from the van@@ tage point of a co@@ al-@@ dependent economy .
china ’ s future choices depend on whether “ clean coal ” can really work effectively and on a large scale .
thus , china ’ s emissions path depends cru@@ cially on early testing of the c@@ cs technologies .
a true global brainstor@@ ming approach would first discuss the best technological and economic options available , and how to improve these options through targeted research and development and better economic incentives .
the negotiations would discuss the range of options open to each country and region – from c@@ cs to solar , wind , and nuclear power – and would sketch a ti@@ me@@ table for a new generation of low-@@ emission automobiles , recognizing that market competition as well as public finan@@ cing will set the actual pace .
based on these building blocks , the world could agree on allo@@ c@@ ating the costs for speeding the development and spread of new low-@@ emission technologies .
this global framework would under@@ pin national and global targets for emissions control and for monitoring the progress of the technological over@@ haul .
as new technologies are proven , the targets would become more string@@ ent .
of course , part of the strategy would be to create market incentives for new low-@@ emission technologies , so that inventors could develop their own ideas with the prospect of large profits if those ideas are right .
but if we don ’ t have a strategy to ac@@ company our targets , the world ’ s governments might not accept such targets in the first place , or might accept them cy@@ ni@@ cally , without any intention of actually meeting them .
we need to think hard , and collabor@@ a@@ tively , about the world ’ s real technological options , and then pursue a common global framework that allows us to move into a new era , one based on feasi@@ ble and sustainable technologies for energy , transport , industry , and buildings .
where did market vola@@ tili@@ ty go ?
television and newspapers continue to trum@@ pet every twist and turn of global financial markets .
in truth , however , the big story is the un@@ e@@ erie calm that has eng@@ ul@@ fed virtually every major asset class , from stocks to bonds .
is the whole investment world on prozac ?
conspiracy theories abo@@ und , particularly among the ran@@ ks of financial tra@@ ders , for whom vola@@ tili@@ ty is like wind to a sail@@ or .
these tra@@ ders confi@@ dently figure that as long as markets gy@@ rate , no matter what the direction , they can always make money .
and , thanks to the rest of us who don ’ t have the time , information , and skill to match wi@@ ts with them , they are mostly right .
but , with today ’ s dor@@ m@@ ant markets , the pick@@ ings are slim .
the favor@@ ed bo@@ ge@@ y@@ men of the day are giant government investors , particularly asian central banks , with their trilli@@ ons of dollars in assets .
these super@@ funds , whose managers do not necessarily share the same passion for profit as private investors , are said to be squee@@ zing the life out of interest rates and exchange rates . “ the big asian central banks are oppres@@ sing us , ” one young tra@@ der recently complained to me .
what a difference a decade makes .
during the 1990 ’ s , private investors looked at big , lum@@ ber@@ ing central banks as cash cows , long on money and short on financial acumen .
george sor@@ os once made a billion dollars off the bank of england in just an hour .
his basic strategy was a standard one : bet against any central bank that tries to defend an in@@ consistent macro@@ economic policy .
tra@@ ders did not win every battle , of course .
it was the spe@@ cul@@ ators whose blood flo@@ wed in the streets when they attacked hong kong ’ s dollar peg in 1998 .
but overall , be@@ tting against big government financial institutions proved to be a rich@@ ly rewar@@ ding business .
that was the 1990 ’ s .
today , many tra@@ ders see for@@ mer@@ ly ine@@ pt state giants as financial geniuses , capable of tam@@ ing complex financial formul@@ as and explo@@ iting their superior size and trading information to squeeze the life out of currency and interest rate markets .
these be@@ he@@ mo@@ ths ’ innate conserva@@ tism , having cal@@ med bond and currency markets , is now having a similar effect on stocks .
although few acc@@ use asian central banks of explicitly con@@ spir@@ ing to calm global markets , some say that their common cau@@ tious approach to trading is a form of implic@@ it coll@@ usion .
as much as we may sym@@ path@@ ize with young w@@ ou@@ l@@ d-@@ be million@@ aire tra@@ ders , does their story of oppres@@ sion make any sense ?
could it be true that huge government investors from asia ( not to mention russia , latin america , and the middle east ) have quietly taken control of world markets ?
perhaps , but the bo@@ ge@@ y@@ man theory seems a bit over@@ blown .
yes , the big asian central banks do sit on almost $ 3 trillion in assets ; china ’ s central bank alone has around a trillion dollars .
this gives them a capital base similar to the combined assets of all the world ’ s major he@@ dge funds .
but this metric is very decep@@ tive .
he@@ dge funds constit@@ ute only a small percentage of overall world financial markets , which , according to a recent study by the mck@@ inn@@ sey global institute , now exce@@ ed $ 120 trillion .
and he@@ dge funds , unlike banks , can leverage their be@@ ts , borrowing to take on assets many times the size of their capital base .
otherwise , george sor@@ os and his wealthy fellow investors could not have dreamed of taking on the bank of england .
in fact , the explanation for market calm probably lies elsewhere .
so , if a conspiracy of asian central banks is not to blame for the vola@@ tili@@ ty drought that is par@@ ching tra@@ ders ’ ear@@ nings , what is ?
surely , today ’ s low vola@@ tili@@ ty is partly cycli@@ cal .
stock market vola@@ tili@@ ty was also very low during the early 1990 ’ s , before reaching new peaks later in the decade .
moreover , financial innovation and globalization allow markets to spread risk more effectively than ever before , placing it in the hands of those who can best manage it .
improved central bank policy is another huge factor .
in the early 1990 ’ s , the average level of world inflation exce@@ eded 30 % ; now it is less than 4 % .
all of these changes have in turn contributed to lower econom@@ y-@@ wide output and consumption vola@@ tili@@ ty in both rich and developing countries .
they have also contributed mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ ly to the high general level of asset prices , helping create the vast ri@@ ches of which today ’ s hungry young tra@@ ders are so jeal@@ ous .
so will today ’ s relative market calm continue ?
unfortunately , no .
today ’ s brave new world of financial globalization will almost surely face severe new stress tests , remin@@ ding us that rec@@ essions still happen .
frankly , although i do not see the five-@@ year-old global expansion coming to an end yet , there is no question that risks are on the rise , with output in the united states having slowed shar@@ ply in the third quarter , and central banks ’ hands tied by inflation risks .
further ahead , it is not hard to imagine geo@@ political inst@@ ability – possibly eman@@ ating from iran , iraq , or north korea – un@@ sett@@ ling markets .
whatever the scenario that ends the calm , today ’ s age of low vola@@ tili@@ ty will seem like a distant dream to most of us – and a forgotten nightmare for ambitious financial tra@@ ders .
where ’ s europe ?
as the global financial crisis transforms itself inex@@ or@@ ably into economic crisis and now industrial crisis , the cry “ where ’ s europe ? ” can be heard across the eu .
so far , brus@@ sels ’ response has been less than reas@@ suring .
the european commission ’ s wat@@ ch@@ word has been that the integrity of the single market must be defen@@ ded at all costs , and that it will use its for@@ mid@@ able legal powers to ensure that bail@@ outs and other state aid by eu governments do not dist@@ ort fair competition .
it is a familiar mantra , and among industri@@ alists the mood now seems to be har@@ dening that it is not enough .
with anxiety moun@@ ting across europe that industrial la@@ y-@@ offs will mean major plant clo@@ sures and cas@@ c@@ ading job losses in thousands of smaller companies , national governments find themselves on a collision course with the eu , though they know that their best chance of sal@@ vation lies in concer@@ ted european action .
in brus@@ sels , there is awareness that the crisis offers real political opportunity , even if the commission has yet to grasp it .
the time has come for a new eu industri@@ al-@@ policy framework that would per@@ mit brus@@ sels to use its “ honest bro@@ ker ” status to manage competing interests .
the commission ’ s euro@@ crats should du@@ st-@@ off their files from 30 years ago and recall how their pre@@ de@@ cess@@ ors hand@@ led the steel crisis that then threatened to provo@@ ke an intra@@ -@@ european trade war .
in the late 1970 ’ s , the commission declared a state of “ manifest crisis ” and agreed with member governments the details of what came to be called the da@@ vi@@ g@@ non plan .
drawn up by the bel@@ gian member of the commission who held the industry portfolio , several of its pro@@ visions are clearly relevant to the current situation , not least to the automobile industry .
the da@@ vi@@ g@@ non plan imposed europe@@ -@@ wide production and price controls , monit@@ ored and coordinated national governments ’ state aids , organized the clo@@ sures of out@@ dated plants , encouraged mer@@ gers , and awar@@ ded eu funding to re@@ training sch@@ emes for redund@@ ant steel workers .
its overall aim was to make the back@@ bone of europe ’ s hea@@ v@@ y-@@ engineering sector more competitive internation@@ ally .
the plan ’ s author , vi@@ com@@ te eti@@ en@@ ne da@@ vi@@ g@@ non , recently comm@@ ented in the bel@@ gian press that he can ’ t understand why the commission is not doing something similar today .
“ to do so would legitimate national aids ( to car@@ makers ) but would ensure they are based on a common eu@@ -@@ level strategy , ” he wrote .
the signals from the commission , though , are not encouraging .
that will be a matter of opinion until the recession begins to ab@@ ate ; the truth is that we don ’ t yet know whether this crisis will be a snow@@ ball that grows layer by layer or an a@@ val@@ an@@ che that swee@@ ps away entire industries .
in either case , the single market will come under increasing pressure .
the commission rightly says that in this age of globalization there is no longer such a thing as a national car@@ maker , but there are still national plants and national pay@@ rolls that politicians facing elections will be desperate to defend .
it doesn ’ t really matter whether a new cris@@ is-@@ beating eu strategy bears some resem@@ blan@@ ce to the largely forgotten da@@ vi@@ g@@ non plan .
the important point is that europe should be seen to have set out a common framework for addressing the slow@@ down .
euro@@ crats insist that the necessary policy instruments and rules are already in place , but that is to ignore political reality .
unless the eu ’ s intern@@ al-@@ market rules can be made more flexible , member governments will fl@@ out them .
the crisis has also under@@ sc@@ ored a lon@@ ger-@@ term need for a more concer@@ ted eu approach to industrial policy .
there is a growing awareness in europe that the crisis is set to re-@@ shape our industrial base , as asian countries take over from the eu and the united states many of their advanced technology fie@@ f@@ doms .
but europe ’ s 10@@ -year-old li@@ s@@ bon strategy to secure global high-tech leadership is widely dis@@ credi@@ ted , which is a further reason to include a large r &amp; d component in any eu@@ -@@ wide industrial program .
presentation is an essential part of any political process , and it ’ s the part where the european commission is least competent .
industrial leaders and ordinary citizens alike want to be told that the eu is working on a policy approach that looks farther ahead than the glo@@ omy present .
ver@@ ve and fan@@ fare may be alien to brus@@ sels , but what is ur@@ gently required is a sense of political show@@ man@@ ship that re@@ stores confidence in the european project as well as the economy .
where will genetic knowledge lead us ?
deci@@ pher@@ ing the human genome has provided insights into the nature of humanity , our relationship to the world , and our future .
we now have the set of instructions that speci@@ fies human develop@@ ment-@@ -@@ how each of us progr@@ essed from a single cell ( a fertili@@ zed egg ) to an adult human com@@ prising a hundred trillion cells of thousands of different types .
so what comes next ?
the genome &apos;s language is dna , whose alphabet has just four different letters : g , c , a , and t. but the genome contains three billion of these letters .
the human genome project translated them into a `@@ book of life , &apos; that consists of 500 volumes , each with 1,000 pages aver@@ aging 1,000 six-@@ letter words per page .
opera@@ tionally , the human genome is composed of one long sentence of three billion letters cut into 24 pie@@ c@@ es-@@ -@@ chromosom@@ es-@@ -@@ that range in size from 45-@@ 2@@ 80 million letters .
in a book , words are collected into sentences , sentences into paragra@@ ph@@ s , and paragra@@ ph@@ s into chapters .
each level provides a higher , more coherent level of meaning .
so , too , with the human genome .
dna &apos;s words are genes , which en@@ code prot@@ eins-@@ -@@ the molecular building blocks of life .
genes and proteins are , in turn , gathered into the biological system@@ s@@ -- heart , brain , kidneys , and so for@@ th-@@ -@@ that ex@@ ec@@ ute the functions of life .
the first dra@@ ft of the human genome , published in february 2001 , provided four new fundamental insights .
first , humanity &apos;s book of life has only 30@@ ,000-@@ 3@@ 5,000 different words , or genes .
this is surprising , because the genome of a tiny worm that had been sequenced earlier contains about 20,000 genes .
how we make do with only one-third more genes than this simple worm remains an un@@ answered puzzle .
second , there are essentially no ra@@ ce-@@ specific words in the book of life .
indeed , the book of life for two black people may differ more than that for a cau@@ casi@@ an person and a black person .
the concept of race is cultural , not genetic .
third , the books of life for humans , fish , flies , and yeast contain a large number of shared words ( although the sp@@ ell@@ ings are somewhat different ) .
many fundamental biological systems composed of these genes and proteins are remarkably similar .
this under@@ scores the des@@ cent of all life from a single common ancestor .
the fourth observation similarly high@@ lights the inter@@ connectedness of all life .
for example , the book of life for humans contains around 200 genes derived from other organisms , contradi@@ cting the long-@@ held view that all of our genes are transmitted vertically , from grandparents to parents to children .
it seems that evolution also occurs in a horizontal context , in which any living creature can incorporate information from surrounding organisms .
the knowledge contained in the book of life has cataly@@ zed paradigm changes in biology and medicine .
we can now study a biological system in terms of how all of its components interact rather than one gene or one protein at a time .
indeed , the institute for systems biology , which i co-@@ founded two years ago , reflects my convi@@ ction that systems approaches will dominate biological study in the 21st century .
the next 10-@@ 15 years will see a shift away from our current re@@ active mod@@ el-@@ -@@ you come in when you get sick and the physician attempts to make you well-@@ -@@ to a predi@@ ctive , pre@@ ven@@ tive , and ultimately a personalized form of medicine .
for example , if you are a woman with a single bad copy of the breast cancer 1 gene , you have a 70 % chance of getting breast cancer by the time you are 60 years old .
why only a 70 % chance ?
in some cases , defe@@ ctive genes require certain environmental signals to be activated , while another , more likely , explanation is that single defe@@ ctive genes are not enough to cause disease ; a number of defe@@ ctive genes must act in concert .
the important point is that within the next 10-@@ 15 years we will have identified hundreds of genes that pre@@ dis@@ pose individuals to virtually all of the common , lat@@ e-@@ onset diseases , such as cancer and cardiovascular , neurological , and metabolic diseases .
we will be able to take a blood sample , determine the possibility of genetic defe@@ cts , and create a prob@@ abili@@ stic health history of what is likely to happen .
physicians will be able to study your genes in the context of the biological systems within which they operate and learn how to circum@@ vent the limitations they impose .
the predi@@ ctive , pre@@ ven@@ tive and personalized medicine of the future could include changes in environment , speci@@ ally designed drugs , gene engineering , and embryonic stem cells .
all of this will pro@@ pel us into a very different world , one that may well extend humans &apos; life span by 10-@@ 30 years , presenting enormous opportunities , but also confron@@ ting us with fascinating and per@@ ple@@ x@@ ing ethical , social , and legal issues .
how , for example , can we capture the enormous potential increase in creativity and productivity if the average human life span is extended into the 90 &apos;s or even beyond ?
who gets to know about predi@@ ctive health hi@@ stories ?
will we per@@ mit doc@@ trin@@ aire religious views to block our ability to explore the enormous potential of embryonic stem cells and thereby lift the yo@@ ke of disease from tens of millions of people ?
these questions under@@ score our obligation to keep ab@@ re@@ ast of advances in science and technology , so that we may use the opportunities they provide to better humankind while dealing thou@@ ght@@ fully and ration@@ ally with the challenges they present .
which globalization will survive ?
cambridge – the world economy will shrink this year for the first time since 1945 , and some economists worry that the current crisis could spell the beginning of the end of globalization .
hard economic times are correlated with prote@@ c@@ tion@@ ism , as each country bl@@ ames others and protects its domestic jobs .
in the 19@@ 30 ’ s , such “ beg@@ gar@@ -@@ th@@ y-@@ neighbor ” policies wor@@ sen@@ ed the situation .
unless political leaders resist such responses , the past could become the future .
ironically , however , such a grim prospect would not mean the end of globalization , defined as the increase in worldwide networks of inter@@ dependence .
globalization has several dimensions , and , though economists all too often portra@@ y it and the world economy as being one and the same , other forms of globalization also have significant effects – not all of them benign – on our daily lives .
the oldest form of globalization is environmental .
for example , the first smallpox epidemic was recorded in egypt in 13@@ 50 bc .
it reached china in 49 ad , europe after 700 , the americas in 15@@ 20 , and australia in l@@ 7@@ 89 .
bu@@ bon@@ ic pla@@ gue , or the black death , origin@@ ated in asia , but its spread killed a quarter to a third of europe ’ s population in the four@@ te@@ enth century .
europeans carried diseases to the americas in the fif@@ te@@ enth and six@@ te@@ enth centuries that destroyed up to 95 % of the indigenous population .
in 1918 , a flu pandemic caused by a bird virus killed some 40 million people around the world , far more than the recently concluded world war .
some scientists today predict a repeat of an avian flu pandemic .
since 1973 , 30 previously unknown infectious diseases have emerged , and other familiar diseases have spread geographi@@ cally in new , dru@@ g-@@ resistant forms .
in the 20 years after hiv / aids was identified in the 1980 ’ s it killed 20 million people and infected another 40 million around the world .
some experts project that that number will double by 2010 .
the spread of foreign species of fl@@ ora and fa@@ una to new areas has wiped out native species , and may result in economic losses of several hundred billion dollars per year .
global climate change will affect the lives of people everywhere .
thousands of scientists from more than 100 countries recently reported that there is new and strong evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attribu@@ table to human activities , and average global temperatures in the twenty-@@ first century are projected to increase between 2.5 and 10 degrees fahrenheit .
the result could be more severe variations in climate , with too much water in some regions and not enough in others .
the effects will include stronger storms , hurri@@ can@@ es , and floods , deeper dr@@ ou@@ ghts , and more land@@ slides .
rising temperatures have l@@ eng@@ th@@ ened the free@@ ze@@ -free season in many regions , and glaciers are melting .
the rate at which the sea level rose in the last century was ten times faster than the average rate over the last three millennia .
then there is military globalization , consi@@ sting of networks of inter@@ dependence in which force , or the threat of force , is employed .
the world wars of the twen@@ tieth century are a case in point .
the prior era of economic globalization reached its peak in 19@@ 14 , and was set back by the world wars .
but , while global economic integration did not regain its 19@@ 14 level until half a century later , military globalization grew as economic globalization shr@@ ank .
during the cold war , the global strategic inter@@ dependence between the united states and the soviet union was acute and well recognized .
not only did it produce world-@@ stra@@ ddling alli@@ ances , but either side could have used inter@@ contin@@ ental missi@@ les to destroy the other within 30 minutes .
this was distinctive not because it was totally new , but because the scale and speed of the potential conflict ar@@ is@@ ing from military inter@@ dependence were so enormous .
today , al qaeda and other transnational actors have formed global networks of opera@@ tives , challenging conventional approaches to national defense through what has been called “ asym@@ metri@@ cal warfare . ”
finally , social globalization consists in the spread of peoples , cultures , images , and ideas .
migration is a concrete example .
in the n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth century , some 80 million people crossed oceans to new homes – far more than in the twen@@ tieth century .
at the beginning of the twenty-@@ first century , 32 million us residents ( 1@@ 1.5 % of the population ) were foreig@@ n-@@ born .
in addition , some 30 million visitors ( students , busines@@ spe@@ op@@ le , touri@@ sts ) enter the country each year .
ideas are an equally important aspect of social globalization .
technology makes physical mobility easier , but local political reactions against immigr@@ ants had been growing even before the current economic crisis .
the danger today is that short-@@ sighted prote@@ c@@ tionist reactions to the economic crisis could help to cho@@ ke off the economic globalization that has spread growth and raised hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over the past half-@@ century .
but prote@@ c@@ tion@@ ism will not cur@@ b the other forms of globalization .
modern technology means that pathogens travel more easily than in earlier periods .
easy travel plus hard economic times means that immigration rates may accelerate to the point where social friction exce@@ eds general economic benefit .
similarly , hard economic times may wor@@ sen relations among governments , as well as domestic conflicts that can lead to violence .
at the same time , transnational terrorists will continue to benefit from modern information technology , such as the internet .
and , while depressed economic activity may slow somewhat the rate of green@@ house@@ -@@ gas buil@@ d-up in the atmosphere , it will also slow the types of costly programs that governments must en@@ act to address emissions that have already occurred .
so , unless governments cooperate to stimulate their economies and resist prote@@ c@@ tion@@ ism , the world may find that the current economic crisis does not mean the end of globalization , but only the end of the good kind , leaving us with the worst of all worlds .
which way is west for turkey ?
when turkey &apos;s parliament voted in march 2003 against allowing american troops to open a northern front against iraq , turkey &apos;s traditional strategic partnership with the united states ended .
the two countries still recognize many mutual interests , but now they manage these interests on a far different basis .
the vote shocked &quot; old europe &quot; and the arab world as much as the bush administration .
europeans who considered turkey a potential tro@@ jan horse for america within the european union were forced to re@@ consider .
for many arab@@ s , the vote showed that turkey was not an american lac@@ key and would not cooperate with american imperial designs , despite close turk@@ ish@@ -@@ israeli relations .
long-@@ sim@@ mer@@ ing dis@@ agre@@ ements between turkey and the us came to a boil with the emergence of the kur@@ ds of northern iraq as the pentagon &apos;s main allies in the iraq war .
the american administration made it clear that military intervention by turkey in northern iraq would not be toler@@ ated .
that message was confir@@ med on july 4 , 2003 , when american forces arrested several turkish special forces troops in the town of su@@ la@@ im@@ ani@@ ya , humili@@ ating them by putting sacks over their head as they took them into cu@@ sto@@ dy .
only intervention by us vice president dick chen@@ ey two and a half days later secu@@ red the release of the soldiers , who were alle@@ ged to have been planning c@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine operations within the kur@@ dish zone .
despite ongoing ten@@ sions , the turkish government has been eager to mend relations with america , as it is anxious to have some influence over developments in iraq .
so the authorities responded quickly to the bush administration &apos;s request for turkish troops to join the coalition , although the idea was still@@ born - rejected by both the kur@@ ds and the americ@@ an-@@ ap@@ pointed gover@@ ning council in iraq .
america has its own reasons to patch up the relationship .
turkey &apos;s secular , capit@@ alistic , democratic order has become especially valuable to the bush administration as it see@@ ks to integrate the wider middle east into the world system by liber@@ alizing its economy and democra@@ tizing its poli@@ ty .
thus , america trum@@ pe@@ ted its continuing support for turkish mem@@ ber@@ ship in the eu , not@@ ably in president bush &apos;s speech in june at istanbul &apos;s gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay university - at a bridge that jo@@ ins asia and europe .
but serious bil@@ ateral problems remain .
the government is irri@@ tated by us occupation forces &apos; negle@@ ct of the northern ira@@ qi bases of the p@@ k@@ k , the kur@@ dish se@@ para@@ tist insur@@ g@@ ents who have fought a 15-@@ year war against turkey .
more broadly , the government regar@@ ds the us as too com@@ plac@@ ent vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis kur@@ dish political developments and un@@ moved by turkey &apos;s concerns about kur@@ dish independence .
the us , for its part , is unhappy with the government &apos;s obje@@ ctions to un@@ restricted american use of the in@@ cir@@ li@@ k air@@ base in sou@@ the@@ astern turkey , as well as by recent ten@@ sions with israel .
in the meantime , turkey is moving closer to the eu , with the government over@@ coming nation@@ alistic obje@@ ctions in the parliament to push through comprehensive reforms .
turkey also showed its good will over c@@ yp@@ rus , removing a na@@ gging political obstacle to eu mem@@ ber@@ ship .
these steps led to the european commission &apos;s recent recommen@@ dation to begin acc@@ ession negotiations with turkey .
the eu acc@@ ession process has also under@@ pinn@@ ed a shift in turkish policy on iraq .
previously , turkey viewed iraq sol@@ ely in the context of its domestic kur@@ dish problem .
but widespread european opposition to the war removed the possibility of turkish military intervention , forcing the government to develop another vision of turkey &apos;s interests .
at the same time , the ira@@ qi kur@@ ds also appear to appreciate how much they need a friendly turkey .
the northern border with turkey is their lifel@@ ine to the outside world .
as a result , turkey no longer consi@@ ders a feder@@ alized iraq a threat to its security , as long as each federal unit main@@ tains a measure of ethnic diversity .
of course , turkey remains opposed to an independent kur@@ di@@ stan .
but now its concern is more closely tied to regional politics than to the kur@@ dish issue .
turkey has no desire to serve as a strategic counter@@ weight to iran and believes that only a terri@@ tor@@ i@@ ally intact iraq can continue to play that role .
furthermore , turkey is concerned about the possibility of civil war in kur@@ di@@ stan between the two largest kur@@ dish fac@@ tions .
but , unlike either iran or syria , turkey genuinely wishes to see a strong and representative government in bag@@ h@@ dad .
thanks to eu pressures , turkey &apos;s domestic kur@@ dish problem is well on the way to being resolved democra@@ tically , with most kur@@ dish leaders in turkey expressing their commitment to turkish unity .
for turkey to consider military intervention in kur@@ di@@ stan , eu member states would first have to rene@@ ge on their commitment to negotiate turkish acc@@ ession .
equally dramatic would be any attempt by the kur@@ ds to for@@ ci@@ bly change the demographic balance of the multi@@ ethnic city of kir@@ ku@@ k .
turkey would prefer that kir@@ ku@@ k , with its large turk@@ men population , be given special status in the for@@ th@@ coming dra@@ ft ira@@ qi constitution .
the us also shows signs of understanding the importance of maintaining a multi@@ ethnic kir@@ ku@@ k and is putting pressure on its kur@@ dish allies .
turkish diplomacy has thus become a well-@@ cali@@ br@@ ated balancing act , moving closer to european positions in the middle east , but eager to maintain close relations with the us .
if this approach succe@@ eds , europe &apos;s bridge to asia may also become its bridge to america .
while russia slept
elections in russia usually somehow signal a political crisis : bor@@ is yel@@ ts@@ in &apos;s re-@@ election as president in 1996 , for example , seemed to hold off a communist resurrec@@ tion-@@ -@@ not by revolution but through the bal@@ lot box .
elections to the state du@@ ma ( the lower house of russia &apos;s parliament ) are normally quie@@ ter affairs , and the just completed campaign and du@@ ma elections ( note to editors , the vote is december 7 th ) were certainly sil@@ ent-@@ -@@ deadly silent .
indeed , so om@@ ni@@ potent is president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin in russia nowadays that the du@@ ma election would have been sc@@ arc@@ ely notic@@ ed-@@ -@@ by the world and russia ali@@ ke-@@ -@@ were it not for the arrest and im@@ prison@@ ment this au@@ tum@@ n of mik@@ ha@@ il k@@ ho@@ dor@@ ko@@ v@@ sky , the oil industry oli@@ gar@@ ch who dar@@ ed to put his money behind two liberal parties opposed to pu@@ tin .
k@@ ho@@ dor@@ ko@@ v@@ sky &apos;s arrest did not gal@@ vani@@ ze ordinary russians , who increasingly see elections as beside the point in their difficult lives .
his arrest did , however , shake international confidence in pu@@ tin , as well as arou@@ se russia &apos;s other oli@@ g@@ arch@@ s and democratic re@@ formers to seriously fear for their freedoms .
the greater the power , the more dangerous the abuse , said ed@@ mund bur@@ ke in 17@@ 71 .
pu@@ tin exercis@@ es a power greater than that allowed any other democra@@ tically elected leader , and the manner in which he exercis@@ es it is now causing serious concern .
lord ac@@ ton &apos;s phrase about the corrup@@ ting effect of power does not yet apply ; bur@@ ke &apos;s warning does .
unlike america &apos;s or mexico &apos;s president , he need not ca@@ jo@@ le a congress ent@@ ren@@ ched behind the ram@@ parts of constit@@ ution@@ ally separate powers .
unlike a british or spanish prime minister , he cannot be removed by a vote of no confidence .
unlike germany &apos;s chan@@ cell@@ or , he is not shack@@ led to a coalition partner who can prevent him going too far .
unlike ber@@ lus@@ con@@ i in italy , l@@ ula in brazil , and ko@@ i@@ zu@@ mi in japan , he does not have to face down in@@ fighting within his own party .
to the huge power of the russian pres@@ iden@@ cy pu@@ tin adds his own alo@@ of temp@@ er and a famili@@ arity , from his k@@ gb years , with the subtle levers of russia &apos;s bureaucracy .
none of this is necessarily wrong : russia &apos;s hard times demand a government that can act decisi@@ vely .
but pu@@ tin &apos;s power is pressing hard against the limits of what is per@@ mis@@ sible in a democracy .
yel@@ ts@@ in never spread his fingers into the no@@ o@@ ks and cran@@ ni@@ es of government as comprehen@@ sively as pu@@ tin .
nothing escap@@ es the eye of the kre@@ m@@ lin@@ -@@ -@@ whether it be which buildings are restored in saint peter@@ sburg or the appointment of minor russian en@@ vo@@ ys abroad .
when so much power is concentrated in one place , it is temp@@ ting to stif@@ le criticism about how that power is used .
in tam@@ ing the oli@@ g@@ arch@@ s bor@@ is bere@@ zo@@ v@@ sky and v@@ la@@ di@@ mir gus@@ in@@ sk@@ y-@@ -@@ who bal@@ ked at accepting his &quot; settlement &quot; where@@ by russia &apos;s richest men would keep their business empires , no matter how ill-@@ gotten , if they kept out of poli@@ tic@@ s-@@ -@@ pu@@ tin did cho@@ ke the media empires both men used to promote their causes .
in a country where the president names the heads of all russia &apos;s state television and radio channels , criticism is not so abundant that any of it can afford to be lost .
but pu@@ tin &apos;s press policy does not add up to an argument that he ought not to be re-@@ elected next march , when he stands again .
indeed , on the great issues of policy , as distinct from the mur@@ ky corners of self-interest , pu@@ tin can still be seen as a good president .
abroad , he has drawn russia into ever closer cooperation with the west : in much of the &quot; war on terror &quot; and the handling of north korea , his policy parall@@ els that of america ; elsewhere , rhetoric about &quot; independence &quot; persi@@ sts , but the real doub@@ ts about who is a reliable partner for the west now point to schro@@ eder &apos;s germany more than to pu@@ tin &apos;s russia .
at home , pu@@ tin has mostly done the right things for russia &apos;s economy , leaving his government in office long enough to re@@ ap the benefits of consisten@@ cy .
his idea of a &quot; dictator@@ ship of law &quot; satis@@ fies enough russians to put him soli@@ dly in command of the political center .
what is worrying about pu@@ tin &apos;s rule is his inability to make russia &apos;s government more transparent .
all deals are private .
laws appear as if by magic .
no one knows if the president ordered k@@ ho@@ dor@@ ko@@ v@@ sky &apos;s arrest or even considered the devastating impact it would inevitably have on investment in russia .
the problem here is that , by keeping political decision-making in the dark , russia &apos;s myri@@ ad power fac@@ tions are never held to account .
for example , what &quot; deal &quot; -@@ -@@ if any@@ -@@ -@@ was struck with russia &apos;s nuclear industry to allow for the continued construction of nuclear plants in iran ?
no one knows .
would the military have been so successful in re@@ tar@@ ding reform if it had to act in the open ?
in his efforts to &quot; get things done , &quot; pu@@ tin pre@@ fers to deal directly with powerful industries and lob@@ bies , rather than shape laws through a rather t@@ ame du@@ ma .
it is the apparent inevi@@ tability of pu@@ tin &apos;s re-@@ election next spring that justi@@ fies concern about his way of wi@@ el@@ ding power .
pu@@ tin could earn the gratitude of future russians by cool@@ ly re-@@ exam@@ ining the powers of his office .
power is best checked by democra@@ tically elected institution@@ s-@@ -@@ by a du@@ ma with real power and a ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary with real te@@ eth@@ -@@ -@@ not by cutting deals with special interests and military / industrial insi@@ ders , or by stac@@ king the government with ex-@@ k@@ gb men who can only intimi@@ date , never inform .
pu@@ tin should recognize that the sheer extent of his presidential power makes it essential that the dark@@ est corners of kre@@ m@@ lin decision-making be exposed to daylight .
white house sex crimes
new york – sex crime has a tell@@ tale signature , even when those direc@@ ting the ou@@ tra@@ ges are some of the most powerful men and women in the united states .
how extraordinary , then , to learn that one of the perpetr@@ ators of these crimes , con@@ do@@ le@@ e@@ zz@@ a rice , has just led the debate in a special session of the united nations security council on the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war .
i had a sense of d@@ é@@ j@@ à v@@ u when i saw the photos that emerged in 2004 from abu ghraib prison .
even as the bush administration was spinning the notion that the torture of prisoners was the work of “ a few bad apples ” low in the military hierarchy , i knew that we were seeing evidence of a systemic policy set at the top .
it ’ s not that i am a genius .
it ’ s simply that , having worked at a rape crisis center and been trained in the basics of sex crime , i have learned that all sex predators go about things in certain recogni@@ zable ways .
we now know that the torture of prisoners was the result of a policy set in the white house by former secretary of defense don@@ ald rum@@ s@@ feld , vice president dick chen@@ ey , and rice – who actually cha@@ ired the torture meetings .
the pentagon has also acknowled@@ ged that it had auth@@ orized sexu@@ alized abuse of deta@@ ine@@ es as part of interro@@ gation practices to be performed by female opera@@ tives .
and documents obtained by the american civil liber@@ ties union have rum@@ s@@ feld , in his own words , “ checking in ” on the sexu@@ alized humili@@ ation of prisoners .
the sexu@@ alization of torture from the top basically turned abu ghraib and gu@@ ant@@ á@@ nam@@ o bay into an organized sex@@ -@@ crime ring in which the traffi@@ cked sex slaves were us-@@ held prisoners .
looking at the classic s and m nature of some of this torture , it is hard not to specu@@ late that someone setting policy was ar@@ oused by all of this .
the non@@ sexual torture that was committed ran@@ ged from beat@@ ings and suff@@ oc@@ ation , electrodes attached to gen@@ it@@ als , and forced sleep deprivation , to prisoners being hung by the wri@@ sts from the ceiling and placed in soli@@ tary con@@ fin@@ ement until psycho@@ sis was induced .
these ab@@ uses viol@@ ate both us and international law .
three former military at@@ tor@@ neys , recognizing this bl@@ unt truth , refused to participate in the “ military tribun@@ als ” – rather , “ show trials ” – aimed at con@@ dem@@ ning men whose conf@@ essions were e@@ lic@@ ited through torture .
though we can now debate what the penalty for wat@@ er-@@ boarding should be , america as a nation , maintaining an odd silence , still cannot seem to discuss the sexual crimes involved .
why ?
indeed , the military com@@ missions act of 2006 was written deliberately with lo@@ op@@ holes that gave imm@@ unity to perpetr@@ ators of many kinds of sexual humili@@ ation and abuse .
there is also the testimony by female soldiers such as lyn@@ n@@ die england about compelling male prisoners to ma@@ stur@@ b@@ ate , as well as an fbi mem@@ o obje@@ cting to a policy of “ highly aggressive interro@@ gation techniques . ”
the mem@@ o c@@ ites a female interro@@ gator rub@@ bing lo@@ tion on a shack@@ led deta@@ ine@@ e and whisper@@ ing in his ear – during ra@@ ma@@ dan when sexual contact with a strange woman would be most offensive – then suddenly bending back his thum@@ bs until he gri@@ ma@@ ced in pain , and viol@@ ently grab@@ bing his gen@@ it@@ als .
sexual abuse in us-@@ operated prisons got worse and worse over time , ultimately including , according to doctors who examined deta@@ ine@@ es , an@@ al so@@ dom@@ y .
all this may sound bizarre if you are a normal person , but it is standard operating procedure for sex offen@@ ders .
those who work in the field know that once sex ab@@ users control a power@@ less victim , they will inv@@ ari@@ ably push the boundaries with ever more extreme behavior .
ab@@ users start by und@@ ressing their victims , but once that line has been bre@@ ached , you are likely to hear from the victim about oral and an@@ al penet@@ ration , greater and greater pain and fear being in@@ fli@@ cted , and more and more car@@ eless@@ ness about exposing the crimes as the perpetr@@ ator ’ s inhi@@ bi@@ tions fall away .
the perpetr@@ ator is also likely to engage in ever-@@ escal@@ ating ration@@ alizations , often arguing that the offen@@ ses serve a greater good .
finally , the victim is bl@@ amed for the abuse : in the case of the deta@@ ine@@ es , if they would only “ behave , ” and conf@@ ess , they wouldn ’ t bring all this on themselves .
silence , and even coll@@ usion , is also typical of sex crimes within a family .
americans are behaving like a dys@@ functional family by shi@@ el@@ ding sex criminals in their midst through silence .
just as sex criminals – and the leaders who directed the use of rape and sexual abuse as a military strategy – were tried and sent@@ enced after the wars in bosnia and sierra leone , so americans must hold accountable those who committed , or auth@@ orized , sex crimes in us-@@ operated prisons .
throughout the world , this per@@ verse and graphic crimin@@ ality has added fuel to anxiety about us cultural and military power .
these acts need to be called by their true names – war crimes and sex crimes – and people in america need to demand justice for the perpetr@@ ators and their victims .
as in a family , only when people start to speak out and tell the truth about rape and sexual assau@@ lt can the healing begin .
whi@@ ther africa ’ s “ frontier markets ” ?
new york – zimbabwe ’ s election appears , once again , to confirm a tru@@ ism : africa only seems to make international headlines when disasters strike – a drought , a coup , a war , a genocide , or , as in the case of robert mu@@ gabe , gross@@ ly in@@ competent government .
but , over the past several years , a number of sub-saharan countries have attracted unprecedented in@@ flows of foreign capital .
recent global financial tur@@ mo@@ il has only added to africa ’ s all@@ ure , because its frontier markets are less vulnerable to international vola@@ tili@@ ty than are most of the world ’ s more familiar emerging economies .
there are three main reasons why many sub-saharan countries are performing well .
first , high commodity prices yield wind@@ fall profits for the region ’ s leading producers of raw materials .
growing demand for energy , metals , and minerals – particularly in china – has driven unprecedented levels of foreign investment .
even large pension funds are beginning to take notice .
moreover , a large number of africa ’ s poorest countries have benef@@ ited from exponential growth in ( primarily united stat@@ es-@@ based ) philanthropy .
but , while both of these positive trends are likely to continue , a third positive factor may not prove as durable .
every year , africans living outside the continent send roughly $ 30 billion to family and friends back home .
these re@@ mit@@ tan@@ ces are vi@@ tally important for economic stability in several african countries .
an economic slow@@ down in the us and europe could substan@@ tially slow this in@@ fusion of cash , because immigr@@ ants are often the first to lose their jobs when recession fears take hold .
at the same time , though africa ’ s frontier economies are less vulnerable than other emerging markets to global financial turbul@@ ence , they are highly vulnerable to political tur@@ mo@@ il closer to home .
the three countries that served as pillars of regional stability for the past several years – nigeria , kenya , and south africa – are now too pre-@@ occupied with political trou@@ bles of their own to provide the peace@@ keepers , reconstruction funds , and political pressure that often limit the damage from conflicts elsewhere in the region .
most of nigeria ’ s problems are well known .
mili@@ tants in the o@@ il-@@ rich niger delta region have at times shut down as much as 30 % of the country ’ s oil exports , a vital source of state revenue .
president umar@@ u y@@ ar ’ a@@ du@@ a has taken concrete steps to tackle eli@@ te-@@ level corruption in nigeria , and appears to have made progress toward a comprehensive peace agreement with the delta rebel@@ s .
but y@@ ar ’ a@@ du@@ a might soon confront a big short-term problem .
the country ’ s national election tribun@@ al , having over@@ turned the outcomes of several provin@@ cial elections , may well annu@@ l the results of last year ’ s presidential race , forcing him to run for president all over again .
while y@@ ar ’ a@@ du@@ a could use the good@@ will that he has built up over the past year to win by an even larger margin , the 9@@ 0-@@ day election campaign would almost certainly trigger civil un@@ rest , and nigeria ’ s leadership would be too busy navi@@ gating domestic political ri@@ val@@ ries to help stabilize conflicts elsewhere in africa .
kenya ’ s trou@@ bles run deeper .
solid economic expansion and one of the world ’ s fa@@ ste@@ st-@@ growing stock markets have not helped the country aver@@ t a dee@@ pen@@ ing political crisis and moun@@ ting ethnic violence since dispu@@ ted presidential election results in december .
president m@@ wa@@ i ki@@ bak@@ i , whom international obser@@ vers acc@@ use of ri@@ gging the vote , has hin@@ ted at a plan to share power in a unity government , but opposition leader rail@@ a od@@ ing@@ a has heard these promises before .
od@@ ing@@ a worked hard to help ele@@ ct ki@@ bak@@ i in 2002 , only to see ki@@ bak@@ i rene@@ ge on a similar ple@@ dge .
despite the alarming escal@@ ation in violence , fears of civil war in kenya are probably exagger@@ ated .
the country ’ s orange opposition movement has recently won key posts in parliament and , for the moment , is he@@ eding calls for calm from former united nations secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general kofi annan and representatives of the african union .
but no one should expect kenya to play a stabili@@ zing regional role again anytime soon .
the continent ’ s third pill@@ ar , south africa , will spend 2008 mi@@ red in an escal@@ ating political feu@@ d between th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki , the lam@@ e-@@ duck president , and jac@@ ob zu@@ ma , a former de@@ pu@@ ty who is the newly elected leader of the rul@@ ing african national congress and the leading candidate to succeed m@@ be@@ ki , his bitter ri@@ val , next year .
south africa ’ s courts have become a political battle@@ ground , as m@@ be@@ ki and his allies use corruption charges to try to cri@@ pple zu@@ ma ’ s candi@@ d@@ acy .
the resul@@ ting political fire@@ storm may well force zu@@ ma to rely on core support from key allies within the country ’ s trade union movement and communist party , challenging the political elite ’ s pro-@@ market consensus and provo@@ king debate over the future of south africa ’ s economic policy .
no countries in sub-saharan africa will have the economic he@@ ft and political self-@@ confidence to replace nigeria , kenya , and south africa as pillars of stability anytime soon .
regional blo@@ cs like the economic community of west african states ( eco@@ was ) , the southern african cust@@ oms union ( sac@@ u ) , and the east african community ( e@@ ac ) will eventually assume larger roles in helping resolve the continent ’ s most intra@@ ctable diplo@@ matic and economic problems .
but that won ’ t happen this year .
there remain many good reasons for investors to take a chance on africa ’ s frontier markets .
but it will not necessarily take a drought , a coup , a war , or a genocide to make them think twice .
beijing – with the likelihood of a contagious sovereig@@ n-@@ debt im@@ plo@@ sion and european bank failures greatly reduced by the greek debt deal and the european central bank ’ s len@@ ding program , it is time to look ahead .
where do the european union , the euro@@ zone , and the eu ’ s highly inde@@ b@@ ted countries go from here ?
will europe be able to roll back its welfare states ’ biggest ex@@ cess@@ es without economic distress and social un@@ rest top@@ pling governments and , in the peripher@@ al countries , under@@ mining al@@ read@@ y-@@ ten@@ u@@ ous agre@@ ements with credi@@ tors ?
the united states ’ economy is gradually revi@@ ving , alb@@ eit slowly by the standards of recovery from a deep recession .
china , brazil , and india have not de@@ coupled from their customers in europe and north america , and so are slowing , though a relatively soft landing is likely if europe ’ s recession is as short and mild as predicted .
the eu ’ s economic output and population are larger than that of the us , so the fate of the 27 eu countries is everyone ’ s business , from new york to new delhi , s@@ ã@@ o paulo to shanghai .
formed originally as a free-@@ trade area , the euro@@ zone com@@ pris@@ es 17 of the countries . kni@@ tting together 17 disparate economies , cultures , and institutions was a monum@@ ental under@@ taking , frau@@ ght with risk .
with some members inside of the euro@@ zone , and others remaining outside of it , and with disparate economic interests and mon@@ etary and fiscal traditions even within the euro@@ zone , agreement is difficult .
that sets the stage for three broad scenarios , each with implications for the european and global economy , the financial and banking system , and relations between the member states and eu institutions .
in the first scenario , a more united and homo@@ gene@@ ous europe emerges from the crisis , en@@ forcing greater restri@@ ctions on member states ’ budgets to reduce apparent risk .
accompanied by a strong , broad euro@@ zone , risk of a future currency crisis remains .
in the second scenario , a two@@ - or three-@@ tier@@ ed europe includes a two-@@ tier@@ ed euro , with the weaker countries using a separate “ euro@@ -@@ b ” currency that can float against the stronger economies ’ “ euro@@ -@@ a . ”
this arrangement would hold out the promise to fis@@ cally stressed economies that , if they get their act together , they could re@@ join euro@@ -@@ a – and do so more readily than they could from their own currency .
in the final scenario , what emerges is a more decentralized europe , with less top-down agreement in areas beyond trade and a smaller , more homo@@ gene@@ ous euro@@ zone composed of the eu ’ s core economies .
such a construct would be far more popular with citizens who are unhappy with the ac@@ cre@@ tion of eu power in brus@@ sels and the loss of traditional sovereig@@ n@@ ty .
some current euro members – greece ( and perhaps others ) – would rever@@ t to national curren@@ cies .
none of these options is easy ; each ent@@ a@@ ils serious difficulties and great risks .
episo@@ dic mu@@ ddling through may be the best that can be hoped for .
for example , how would greece ( or any country ) exit the euro in order to cus@@ hi@@ on the extreme down@@ ward wage adju@@ st@@ ment required to regain competi@@ tiveness , and to avoid the severe social un@@ rest that could result from rein@@ ing in debt too rapidly ?
as soon as word got out that greece was seriously considering such a move – well before it could even generate a new dra@@ ch@@ ma currency – euro bank depos@@ its would fle@@ e greece .
some contracts denomin@@ ated in euros would be subject to greek law , some to european law , and others – for example , deriva@@ tives contracts – to british or us law .
legal chaos would result .
yet sticking to the euro and forcing all of the adju@@ st@@ ments in wages risks greater un@@ rest ; indeed , it might merely post@@ pone the inevitable .
governments and the bond market will test the seriousness of the newly agreed fiscal guidelines ( if they are rati@@ fied ) .
while talk is tough now , the history of such agre@@ ements does not inspire optimism .
in the us , the 1980 ’ s deficit limits set by the gra@@ mm-@@ ru@@ d@@ man-@@ holl@@ ings law were not met , and , like the s@@ g@@ p , were re@@ vised and extended .
agre@@ ements with , and access to , the international mon@@ etary fund and europe ’ s new bail@@ out fund provide ( soft ) constraints .
regardless of how these governance and fiscal issues are resolved , or mu@@ ddled through , europe ’ s banks remain a thor@@ ny issue .
with the time affor@@ ded by the ec@@ b ’ s three-@@ year cheap loans , they have some breathing room to rebuild their capital and clean up their balance sheets .
but , while doing so , they are not likely to be expanding privat@@ e-@@ sector len@@ ding to support economic growth .
european banks are far more thin@@ ly capit@@ alized , and account for a much larger share of credit extended , than banks in the us , where much more len@@ ding origin@@ ates in capital markets .
most large us banks – c@@ iti is an exception – passed us federal reserve stress tests recently , with enough capital to with@@ stand a hypothetical deep recession ( 13 % unemployment , a 21 % further fall in home prices , and a 50 % stock@@ -@@ market decline ) .
europe ’ s stress tests have been much weaker .
some sort of bra@@ dy bond to reduce and extend exc@@ essive sovereig@@ n debt will be necessary .
we can expect further european tur@@ mo@@ il – from banks , sovereig@@ n debt , and social un@@ rest in response to even modest wel@@ far@@ e-@@ state roll@@ backs – and clas@@ hing visions , within and among countries , concern@@ ing the des@@ ir@@ ability of deeper european integration .
europe has come a long way from the days when its leaders pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied that the euro would quickly ri@@ val the dollar as a global reserve currency .
it still has great strengths , and , with sensible reforms , the eu can survive and eventually return to greater prosperity and stability .
but europe remains closer to the beginning of that process of renew@@ al than to the end .
la@@ hore – pakistan remains the world ’ s never@@ -@@ ending question .
as 2010 conclu@@ des , several out@@ standing issues continue to be@@ devil the country .
how they are managed in the year ahead will determine not only pakistan ’ s immediate future and long-term pro@@ spe@@ cts , but also the security of its region and , indeed , much of the world .
it has been said – without exagger@@ ation – that pakistan faces an existential threat .
the country has not defined a coherent approach towards those who are res@@ or@@ ting to terrorism to advance their agen@@ das , both within pakistan and abroad .
it remains un@@ committed to the idea of den@@ ying sanctu@@ aries on its territory to taliban fighters bat@@ tling american and nato troops in afghanistan .
relations with india have sou@@ red in recent months , because pakistan ’ s government is once again len@@ ding diplo@@ matic support to the insur@@ gency in indi@@ an-@@ controlled k@@ ash@@ mir .
domestic terrorism in pakistan has taken a heavy human and economic toll .
it is no longer aimed at official support of united stat@@ es-@@ led anti-@@ terrorism activities .
sun@@ ni islamic extremi@@ sts now target minority groups as well as other muslim se@@ cts .
some 800 liberal and sufi islamic scholars have died in targeted kill@@ ings by extrem@@ ist groups who receive financial assistance from like@@ -@@ minded people in the middle east , and some well-known and mu@@ ch-@@ visited sufi shr@@ ines have been bom@@ bed .
the economy is in sham@@ bles , and unable to meet the international mon@@ etary fund demands for its continued support .
if the imf termin@@ ates its current program , pakistan will be unable to service its foreign debt .
indeed , a senior cabinet minister suggested recently that the international community should write off pakistan ’ s deb@@ ts – an amount estimated at $ 40 billion .
the minister of finance for@@ ce@@ fully repu@@ di@@ ated the suggestion the following day , indic@@ ating that the government has not developed a consistent approach towards the fal@@ tering economy .
the economy was also badly hurt by the massive floods of 2010 , which caused damage estimated at $ 10 billion .
this damage could lower annual gdp growth by 1-@@ 1.5 % for several years to come .
in the 20@@ 10-@@ 2011 fiscal year , the imf estimates that economic output will increase by less than 3 % – one-third the rate expected in neighbor@@ ing india and less than half that of bangladesh .
slower economic growth will cause a short@@ fall of jobs for new ent@@ rants to the workforce , thereby increasing the inci@@ dence of poverty .
indeed , the number of people living in absolute poverty is likely to increase by 10 million , bringing the total to more than 70 million , or 40 % of the population .
pakistan thus ends 2010 as the sick man of south asia .
the political system also remains un@@ settled .
despite passage in july of the 18th am@@ end@@ ment to the pakistani constitution , which restored it to the form in which it was pro@@ mul@@ gated in 1973 , political and executive authority remains in the hands of president as@@ if ali zar@@ dar@@ i .
the changes are supposed to make the executive branch accountable to the elected parliament , expand the prime minister ’ s authority , de@@ vol@@ ve more power to the provin@@ ces , and ensure independence to the ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary .
in late 2009 , the president also approved the seventh national finance commission , which will allo@@ cate to the provin@@ ces a larger share of the revenues collected by the central government .
but a significant transfer of power from the pres@@ iden@@ cy to parliament , or from the central to provin@@ cial governments , has yet to be brought about .
worse yet , the military remains outside civilian control .
general ash@@ fa@@ q per@@ ve@@ z ka@@ y@@ ani ’ s term in office , which was set to ex@@ pi@@ re in november , was extended by three years .
thus empowered , the general has been able to ex@@ ert his influence over foreign policy , in particular in defining the country ’ s relations with the us , india , and afghanistan .
even though the us offered $ 2 billion of assistance to the military to be dis@@ bur@@ sed over a period of 3-@@ 5 years , ka@@ y@@ ani has resi@@ sted american pressure to move against the taliban ’ s sanctu@@ ary in north wa@@ zi@@ ri@@ stan , used to stage operations against us and nato troops in southern and eastern afghanistan .
so , is a further increase in violence by various extrem@@ ist groups likely ?
will the economy collapse if the imf with@@ draws its support ?
will the us increase its pressure by interven@@ ing milit@@ arily if pakistan continues to harbor taliban fighters operating from the tribal areas ?
will the military sub@@ ver@@ t the constitu@@ tional changes aimed at re@@ forming the political system ?
despite all the grim news and augu@@ ries , there is some hope , o@@ wing to the increased political mobili@@ zation of pakistan ’ s middle classes , whose members have finally begun to question those es@@ po@@ using extremism .
the ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary is also more active , and is attemp@@ ting to force the executive to remain within the bo@@ unds of the constitution .
moreover , a trade agreement with afghanistan that allows afghan goods to cross pakistan en route to india may be one step towards an improvement of economic relations with that large and rapidly growing neighbor .
indeed , an able economic team that has been installed in the government seems – at long last – to be addressing some of the economy ’ s deep structural flaws .
as india in the 1990 ’ s and brazil in the early 2000 ’ s showed , economies in deep distress can recover quickly once the right policies are implemented .
it could also happen in pakistan , which would help to solve other , seemingly intra@@ ctable problems .
so all hope is not lost in pakistan .
on the contrary , 2011 may well prove to be a better year for a bat@@ tered economy and a political system under stress .
whi@@ ther the dollar ?
whi@@ ther the egyptian revolution ?
washington , dc – egypt ’ s revolution top@@ pled a dictator in february , but the country ’ s future as a stable , functioning democracy remains un@@ certain .
the west is , of course , limited in its ability to shape the transition process .
nonetheless , the potential for construc@@ tive influence remains consider@@ able , and it should be responsive to those in egypt who favor liberal ideas , democratic institutions , and broad distribution of the benefits of economic development .
the up@@ coming parli@@ am@@ entary elections are but an early stage in a long ( perhaps dec@@ ad@@ es-@@ long ) struggle to define the new egypt .
will egypt gravi@@ tate toward islamic theo@@ cracy or adopt a secular government that respects minority rights ?
which economic policies – stati@@ st , liberal , or some combination of the two – will best ensure social justice and broad distribution of prosperity ?
can civilian control of the military be established ?
will the regional security structure formed around the united states , egypt , and israel survive ?
the november elections will not resolve these fundamental questions , and whether a work@@ able constitu@@ tional framework will develop is un@@ certain .
a parli@@ am@@ entary system of government will likely emerge , including a prime minister and a cabinet , with the strong possibility that the pres@@ iden@@ cy will be politically over@@ sha@@ do@@ wed , particularly if the presidential election is del@@ a@@ yed .
the central unknown is the composition of the rul@@ ing coalition .
it appears unlikely that a single party will emerge from the election with enough parli@@ am@@ entary seats to govern on its own .
so a coalition government will be necessary .
the political arm of the muslim bro@@ ther@@ hood ( the freedom and justice party ) currently is the best-@@ organized party , and may be in the strongest position to form a majority coalition , including sal@@ af@@ ist elements .
by contrast , secular liberal parties have yet to develop effective organizations or project compelling visions for the future .
although senti@@ ment favor@@ ing a secular state is consider@@ able , a coalition that can serve as an alternative or counter@@ weight to the muslim bro@@ ther@@ hood will be difficult to assemble .
in the near term , the most likely counter@@ weight could be a liberal coalition with a heavy component of former members of de@@ posed president ho@@ sn@@ i mubarak ’ s national democratic party ( n@@ dp ) – that is , those who have not been dis@@ credi@@ ted by their association with mubarak .
election rules favor those who were organized before the revolution .
approximately one-third of the new parliament will com@@ prise “ non-@@ party list ” candidates .
established networks based on family , local loy@@ alties , and tribal aff@@ ili@@ ations will be key determin@@ ants in voting . these circumstances may favor “ non-@@ party list ” candidates associated with the muslim bro@@ ther@@ hood and the former n@@ dp , particularly in rural egypt .
post-@@ election shifts in the composition of co@@ ali@@ tions could complic@@ ate the situation , making governance even more difficult .
power-@@ sharing among coalition partners will be an intricate aff@@ air , including be@@ hin@@ d-@@ the-@@ scenes deals with the military , which will insist on measures to safe@@ guard its interests .
the political atmosphere in egypt remains vola@@ tile .
expectations of economic improvement are extremely high .
the initial elected government may pay an early political price for failure .
the starting point for the west in trying to ass@@ ist egypt ’ s transition must be recognition that patient , long-term engagement will be required .
the effectiveness of this engagement will depend primarily on the persu@@ asi@@ veness of the west ’ s policy prescri@@ ptions , rather than on the volume of financial assistance .
g-@@ 8 countries have already ple@@ dged support to post-@@ mubarak egypt , including economic aid , debt relief , and loan guarante@@ es .
these steps are important , though delivery will be pro@@ lon@@ ged and the likely impact modest , at least in the near-@@ term .
egypt has already declined support from the international mon@@ etary fund .
but , apart from an im@@ f-@@ backed reform program , if the egyptian government ’ s policy framework is right , resources will flow from the private sector , including foreign investment supportive of job creation and economic development .
this is the message that egypt needs to grasp and embrace .
g-@@ 8 governments should ur@@ gently and repeatedly under@@ take quiet , structured , and consistent communications with egyptian counter@@ parts about the economic reforms needed to bring about prosperity .
it is far too early to judge the strength of internal forces promoting liberal economic policies .
the need for economic growth could intrinsically push policymakers toward market@@ -@@ oriented economic policies ( sensitive to consider@@ ations of “ social justice ” ) and an open investment environment .
powerful forces within the egyptian business community are silent at the moment , but in time will reas@@ sert themselves .
many business interests with job@@ -@@ creating capacity want the continu@@ ation of market@@ -@@ oriented reforms begun a decade ago ( which produced impressive growth rates ) , but support bro@@ aden@@ ing prosperity and ro@@ oting out corruption .
moreover , an independent media might tend to rein@@ force pro-@@ market and democratic senti@@ ment .
indeed , western governments should continue to use their channels to the egyptian military and future civil leadership to encourage them to uph@@ old the rule of law , to act with restra@@ int , and to respect free expression .
regional security arrangements will also require careful maintenance .
finally , countries supportive of a democratic egypt should focus on encouraging the institutional and social under@@ pinn@@ ings of democratic process and market reform .
this depends on the development of a robust civil society , tolerant of open debate , and healthy liberal political parties , as well as active participation by women and an independent media .
winning broad public support will take time .
private non-profit organizations and private enterprise , rather than governments directly , are best equipped to provide this type of training and expertise for leadership development and capacity building .
the job of democratic governments is to provide the resources that can make delivery of this aid possible .
whi@@ ther the strong dollar ?
cambridge : in his first international ou@@ ting america ’ s new treas@@ ury secretary paul o ’ nei@@ ll got tri@@ pped up – by telling the truth .
during the clinton administration , treas@@ ury secretary robert ru@@ bin and then lawrence su@@ mmers stated that america had a “ strong dollar policy . ”
o ’ nei@@ ll repor@@ tedly said that “ we are not pursuing ... a policy of a strong dollar . ” immediately attacked for rever@@ sing a long-@@ held policy , he quickly re@@ treated .
too bad , because his comment made a lot more sense than his pre@@ de@@ cess@@ ors ’ statements .
the truth is , america really doesn ’ t have an exchange rate policy .
when alan green@@ span pon@@ ders the next move in us interest rates , little attention is paid to the dollar ’ s exchange rate vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis the euro , yen , or other curren@@ cies .
american mon@@ etary policy decisions depend on the strength or weakness of the domestic economy and on us inflation .
if the economy is slowing , if there is excess capacity , and if inflation is low , interest rates are reduced ; if the economy is strong , if excess capacity is limited , and if infla@@ tionary pressures are growing , interest rates are raised .
nor does the fed intervene directly in foreign exchange markets except in extraordinary circumstances .
in only one sense does the us actually pursue a “ strong dollar ” policy : the federal reserve ’ s mon@@ etary policy is designed to keep inflation low .
the dollar is kept “ strong ” in terms of its purchasing power over us goods and services .
but this is not what markets believed the “ strong dollar ” policy meant . they believed that the strong dollar policy referred to exchange rates .
in this sense , the “ strong dollar ” policy would mean that america has a “ weak euro ” policy or a “ weak yen ” policy .
it has no such thing .
so why did succ@@ essive treas@@ ury secre@@ tar@@ ies say that the us has a strong dollar policy ?
part of the answer is that support for a strong dollar is an easy slogan ; it sounds patri@@ otic .
moreover , it would have been viewed as hostile if secre@@ tar@@ ies ru@@ bin and su@@ mmers insisted that they believed in a “ weak euro ” , even if they were implic@@ itly saying that .
a tru@@ er statement for ru@@ bin and su@@ mmers would have been to say that america actually has no exchange rate policy , the answer that o ’ nei@@ ll tried to give .
another reason exists for their statements . some us officials believe that the “ strong dollar ” statements helped stabilize foreign exchange markets , even if american mon@@ etary policy was not directed at the dollar ’ s strength vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis the euro or yen .
some believe that , without such statements , the dollar would pl@@ unge relative to the euro and yen .
after all , if the u@@ stre@@ as@@ ury secretary does not support the dollar , what would sustain its value ?
according to this interpretation , market participants would begin to predict the decline of the dollar .
they would sell dollars in antici@@ pation of its decline . those currency sales would indeed lead to a collapse of the currency .
the decline in the dollar ’ s value would be a self-@@ fulfilling prophe@@ cy .
self-@@ fulfilling s@@ wings in a currency do seem to operate .
statements about a “ strong dollar ” policy could support the value of the dollar over a short period of time , even years .
but eventually , fundamental economic strengths and weak@@ nesses have more effect on the exchange rate than self-@@ fulfilling prophe@@ cies .
if , as now seems to be the case , america ’ s economy is weak@@ ening while europe ’ s economies remain strong , the dollar will wea@@ ken vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis the euro whether or not the us treas@@ ury secretary promotes the dollar .
a weaker dollar vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis the euro will help sustain demand in the us as the economy slo@@ ws .
similarly , the yen will tend to wea@@ ken vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis both the dollar and the euro because of japan ’ s underlying weak@@ nesses .
if statements about a strong dollar policy had any effect at all , they probably helped promote america ’ s financial bubble during 199@@ 8-@@ 2000 .
investors in the us and the rest of the world believed for this short period that investments in the us guaranteed ri@@ ches ; this contributed to the boom and bust in us technology stocks .
the naive view that the dollar would always remain strong ( and would streng@@ then even more ) vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis the euro added fuel to the capital in@@ flows into america .
now that the bubble is bur@@ sting , us stock markets are down and the dollar is weak@@ ening relative to the euro .
the earlier ex@@ cess@@ es could bring on a recession in the us this year .
so what should america ’ s exchange rate policy be ?
bas@@ ing american mon@@ etary policy on domestic business conditions , rather than on the exchange rate , is correct .
small economies closely integrated with their trading partners might set exchange rate targets , or fix their exchange rate to the curren@@ cies of their trading partners , but large and relatively closed economies like the us , eu , and japan , do better to focus on their own business conditions , letting markets determine the exchange rate .
the dollar should be left to rise or fall vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis the euro and yen depending on the underlying strengths and weak@@ nesses of the three economic areas .
in today ’ s context , market forces will probably lead to a further weak@@ ening of the dollar vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis the euro , and a further weak@@ ening of the yen vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis both the dollar and the euro .
secretary o ’ nei@@ ll therefore had it right , even if his words were cl@@ um@@ sy .
america should have neither a strong dollar nor a weak dollar policy , only a policy of sensible domestic mon@@ etary policies , and a belief that foreign exchange markets should determine exchange rates .
who are tomorrow ’ s consumers ?
singapore – lux@@ ur@@ y-@@ brand companies ’ stock prices pl@@ un@@ ged in july , after their financial results disappointed investors , o@@ wing largely to slower sales in emerging markets , especially in china .
meanwhile , news reports indicate that high-@@ end shopping m@@ alls in india and china are increasingly empty .
what is going on ?
many analy@@ sts had expected emerging markets to generate exponential growth over the next decade .
but now there is talk of how the global crisis is slowing down these economies and killing off discre@@ tionary spending .
but a slow@@ down in china ’ s economic growth cannot really be bl@@ amed for slower sales of luxury goods or empty m@@ alls .
the annual growth rate of china ’ s $ 7.@@ 5 trillion economy dec@@ eler@@ ated to 7.@@ 6 % in the second quarter , from 8.@@ 1 % in janu@@ ar@@ y-@@ march – hardly a cause for panic .
moreover , two-thirds of the decline is attribu@@ table to slower investment rather than slower consumption .
for all of china ’ s long-term structural problems , it is not exactly sli@@ pping into recession .
the real problem is that many analy@@ sts had exagger@@ ated the size of the lux@@ ur@@ y-@@ goods segment in emerging markets .
china is by far the largest emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market economy , with 1.@@ 6 million households that can be called “ rich ” ( defined as having annual dis@@ pos@@ able income of more than $ 150,000 ) .
but this is still smaller than japan ’ s 4.@@ 6 million and a fraction of the 19@@ .@@ 2 million rich households in the united states .
the number of rich households amounts to barely 0.@@ 7 million in india and one million in brazil .
the point is that developed countries still dominate the income bra@@ cket that can afford luxury goods .
the explo@@ sive growth recorded by this segment in emerging markets in recent years reflected entry into previously un@@ tapped markets , with the subsequ@@ ent slow@@ down resul@@ ting from sat@@ u@@ ration .
the number of high-@@ income households is still growing , but not enough to justify the 30-@@ 40 % com@@ po@@ unded growth rates expected by some .
this does not mean that growth opportunities in emerging markets have disappeared , but expectations do need to be rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ated .
despite the economic boom of the last decade , china still has 16@@ 4 million households that can be called “ poor ” ( with annual dis@@ pos@@ able income of less than $ 5,000 ) and another 17@@ 2 million that are “ as@@ pir@@ ant ” ( between $ 5,@@ 000@@ - $ 15,000 ) .
similarly , india has 10@@ 4 million poor households and 10@@ 7 million as@@ pir@@ ant households .
the real story for the next two decades will be these countries ’ shift to middle-class status .
although other emerging regions will under@@ go a similar shift , asia will dominate this transformation .
a study by the economist hom@@ i k@@ har@@ as of the bro@@ ok@@ ings institution gives us a sense of the scale of this change .
he estimates that 18 % of the world ’ s middle class lived in north america in 2009 , while another 36 % lived in europe .
asia ’ s share was 28 % ( after including japan ) .
but k@@ har@@ as ’ s projections suggest that asia will account for two-thirds of the world ’ s middle class by 2030 .
in other words , asia will dis@@ place not just the west , but even other emerging regions .
this is the real business opportunity .
of course , the rise of asia ’ s middle class is not the only change we should expect .
we are in the middle of a social and demographic shift that will both destroy and create consumer markets . the aging of developed markets is well known , but the latest data show that emerging markets are aging at an even faster pace .
china ’ s medi@@ an age is today 3@@ 4.@@ 5 years , compared to 3@@ 6.@@ 9 years for the us .
however , the average chinese will be 4@@ 2.5 years old by 2030 , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 for the average american .
the medi@@ an russian will be even older , at 4@@ 3.@@ 3 years .
the impact of aging is already being felt in these countries ’ education systems .
the number of students en@@ rolled in primary schools in china has fallen by 18 % since 1990 , and by an astonishing 33 % in south korea .
at the other end of the demographic scale , the share of the aged is growing explo@@ sively .
meanwhile , the nature of the basic consuming unit – the household – is also changing rapidly .
in most developed countries , the traditional nuclear family is in severe decline and is being replaced by single-@@ individual households .
in germany , for example , 39 % of households con@@ s@@ ist of just one person .
couples with children now account for barely 19 % and 22 % of households in the united kingdom and the us , respe@@ ctively .
nevertheless , it is not all about consumer atom@@ ization .
we are simultaneously witn@@ essing the re-@@ emergence of the multi@@ gener@@ ational extended family , with as many as 22 % of american adults in the 25-@@ 35 age group living with parents or relatives .
by contrast , the extended family is giving way in india to nuclear families , which now account for 64 % of households .
all of these changes will profoundly affect the future of consumer markets .
for example , we need to re@@ v@@ ise our mental image of the nuclear family from american suburbia to fit the rapidly expanding cities of india .
by the same token , our mental image of the multi@@ gener@@ ational extended family needs to include those in the west .
an aging but increasingly middle-class asia will be at the core of this new consumer landscape .
who beats corruption ?
corruption under@@ mines the quality of life for people around the world , not only in poor countries .
the us currently is witn@@ essing several corruption sc@@ and@@ als .
even america ’ s federal emergency management agency , responsible for providing relief after natural disasters and man-made cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es , was in the hands of ine@@ pt political cr@@ onies rather than professionals .
when hurricane katrina struck america ’ s gulf coast , that in@@ compe@@ tence proved fatal .
all societies require an effective government that can provide vital and ir@@ replac@@ e@@ able public services and infrastructure .
thus , governments are invested with unique powers , especially the powers of policing and ju@@ di@@ cial control .
but these powers are also readily abused .
how , then , to ensure that governments are la@@ w-@@ ab@@ i@@ ding as well as strong ?
the best answer , both in theory and practice , is to find ways to hold governments accountable to the people that they serve .
elections are obviously one method , though campaign finan@@ cing can be a source of corruption .
politicians around the world trade favor@@ s for cash needed to win elections , and they often use that cash to buy the votes of desperately poor people .
clear elec@@ toral rules and procedures can help ensure transparency , but accountability also comes from the broad society in between elections .
priv@@ ately owned newspapers , independent radio and television networks , trade uni@@ ons , chur@@ ches , professional societies , and other groups within civil society provide a bul@@ war@@ k against des@@ po@@ tism .
in the poorest countries , where il@@ literacy is high , desperate people are subject to government manipulation , and there is a lack of independent control through the media and professional organizations , governments face only weak control by society .
they tend to be the most des@@ po@@ tic and corrupt , not because poor people care less about good governance – on the contrary , their very lives depend on it – but because they lack the means to keep their government discipl@@ ined and law ab@@ i@@ ding .
the result is a trap in which poverty causes bad governance and bad governance causes poverty – a two-way spiral down@@ ward that can lead to such extreme deprivation that the government , lac@@ king computers , telephones , information systems , and trained civil ser@@ van@@ ts , couldn ’ t function honestly even if it wanted to .
the end result can be collapse into a kind of an@@ archy , as in liberia , sierra leone , and somalia .
one measure of the quality of governance in over 150 countries is provided by transparency international , an organization dedicated to streng@@ th@@ ening civil society in the fight against government corruption .
transparency international produces an annual ran@@ king of “ corruption perceptions , ” measuring the public ’ s view of the extent of corruption in a country .
in the 2005 r@@ ank@@ ings , iceland sc@@ ored as the least corrupt country , with the sc@@ andin@@ avian countries , new zealand , and singapore close behind .
the us ran@@ ked sevent@@ e@@ enth from the top , a not-@@ so-@@ glorious position for the world ’ s leading power .
in general , the poorer the country , the lower the ran@@ king : tied for last place are chad and bangladesh .
a bit of statistical analysis reveals further important patterns .
first , sub-saharan african countries are less corrupt on average than countries at the same income level in other parts of the world .
for example , burkina faso , ghana , mal@@ i , and rwanda rank much higher than bangladesh , indonesia , pakistan , and vietnam .
yet the asian countries ’ economies have ten@@ ded to grow much faster over the past generation .
corruption therefore cannot be the unique factor that holds africa back .
africa ’ s problems have more to do with dr@@ ou@@ ghts , malaria , aids , and lack of infrastructure .
poor countries achieve lower levels of corruption when civil rights are protected .
when people have the freedom to assemble , to speak , and to publish their views , society benefits not only by increasing the range of ideas that are deb@@ ated , but also by keeping corruption in check .
it is no surprise that corrupt regimes routinely cl@@ amp down on the press , trade uni@@ ons , and on professional associ@@ ations .
in africa , less corrupt countries like ghana also have much better protection of civil liber@@ ties than more corrup@@ tion-@@ prone countries like chad and ethiopia , which are also even poorer .
finally , the data show that corruption is highest in oil and gas@@ -@@ producing countries .
in general , natural resources like oil , gas , diamonds , and other precious minerals breed corruption , because governments can live off of their export ear@@ nings without having to “ compromise ” with their own societies .
the natural resources are therefore not only a target of corruption but also an instrument of holding power .
many foreign companies , intent on c@@ ash@@ ing in , fuel the pathology of corrupt regimes by pe@@ ddling in bribes and political protection .
the implications for action are clear . by streng@@ th@@ ening civil society – through legal rights and long-term economic development – and institu@@ ting clear rules to ensure accountability , political des@@ po@@ tism and corruption will be brought under control .
we should be un@@ com@@ promising , therefore , in our defense of civil liber@@ ties .
the rich world should offer im@@ pover@@ ished regions like sub-saharan africa more economic support to break out of poverty .
of course , aid should be directed to specific needs – for example , malaria control , food production , safe drinking water , and sanitation – whose ful@@ fill@@ ment can be measured and monit@@ ored to resist corruption .
by raising living standards , we would also be empowering both civil society and im@@ pover@@ ished governments to defend the rule of law .
who caused the currency wars ?
washington , dc – the world is on the br@@ ink of a nasty confron@@ tation over exchange rates – now sp@@ illing over to affect trade policy ( america ’ s flir@@ tation with prote@@ c@@ tion@@ ism ) , attitudes towards capital flows ( new restri@@ ctions in brazil , thailand , and south korea ) , and public support for economic globalization ( rising anti-@@ foreig@@ ner senti@@ ment almost everywhere ) .
who is to blame for this situation getting so out of control , and what is likely to happen next ?
the issue is usually fra@@ med in terms of whether some countries are “ cheating ” by holding their exchange rates at an under@@ valued rate , thus boo@@ sting their exports and limit@@ ing impor@@ ts relative to what would happen if their central banks flo@@ ated the local currency freely .
the main cul@@ pr@@ it in this conventional view is china , although the international mon@@ etary fund is a close second .
but , considered more broadly , the seriousness of today ’ s situation is primarily due to europe ’ s ref@@ us@@ al to reform global economic governance , com@@ po@@ unded by years of political mis@@ management and self-@@ deception in the united states .
china certainly bears some responsibility .
partly by design and partly by chance , about a decade ago china found itself consistently accum@@ ulating large amounts of foreign reserves by running a trade surplus and interven@@ ing to buy up the dollars that this generated .
in most countries , such intervention would tend to push up inflation , because the central bank issues local currency in return for dollars .
but , because the chinese financial system remains tightly controlled and the options for investors are very limited , the usual infla@@ tionary consequences have not followed .
this gives china the unprecedented – for a large trading country – ability to accumulate foreig@@ n-@@ exchange reserves ( now approaching $ 3 trillion ) .
its curr@@ ent-@@ account surplus pe@@ aked , before the financial crisis of 2008 , at around 11 % of gdp .
and its export lobby is fighting fier@@ c@@ ely to keep the exchange rate roughly where it is relative to the dollar .
in principle , the imf is supposed to press countries with under@@ valued exchange rates to let their curren@@ cies appreciate .
the rhetoric from the fund has been ambitious , including at the recently concluded annual meeting of its share@@ holders – the world ’ s central banks and finance mini@@ stries – in washington .
but the reality is that the imf has no power over china ( or any other country with a curr@@ ent-@@ account surplus ) ; the final comm@@ uniqu@@ é last weekend was arguably the lam@@ est on record .
unfortunately , the imf is guilty of more than hu@@ bris .
its handling of the asian financial crisis in 199@@ 7-@@ 1998 severely an@@ tag@@ oni@@ zed leading middle-@@ income emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market countries – and they still believe that the fund does not have their interests at heart . here , the west europeans play a major role , because they are greatly over@@ represented on the imf ’ s executive board and , despite all entre@@ a@@ ties , simply refuse to con@@ soli@@ date their seats in order to give emerging markets significantly more influence .
as a result , emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market countries , a@@ iming to ensure that they avo@@ id@@ needing financial support from the imf in the fores@@ ee@@ able future , are increasingly following china ’ s lead and trying to ensure that they , too , run curr@@ ent-@@ account sur@@ pl@@ uses .
in practice , this means fer@@ vent efforts to prevent their curren@@ cies from appreci@@ ating in value .
but a great deal of responsibility for today ’ s global economic dangers re@@ sts with the us , for three reasons .
first , most emerging markets feel their curren@@ cies pres@@ sed to appreciate by growing capital in@@ flows .
investors in brazil are being offered yields around 11 % , while similar credit risks in the us are paying no more than 2-@@ 3 % .
moreover , us rates are likely to stay low , because america ’ s financial system blew itself up so completely ( with help from european banks ) , and because low rates remain , for domestic reasons , part of the post-@@ crisis policy mix .
second , the us has run record curr@@ ent-@@ account defic@@ its over the past decade , as the political elite – republican and democrats alike – became increasingly comfortable with over@@ consumption .
leading bush administration officials used to talk of the us curr@@ ent-@@ account deficit being a “ gift ” to the outside world .
but , honestly , the us has been over@@ consuming – living far beyond its means – for the past decade .
the idea that tax cuts would lead to productivity gains and would pay for themselves ( and fix the budget ) has proved entirely ill@@ us@@ ory .
third , the net flow of capital is from emerging markets to the us – this is what it means to have curr@@ ent-@@ account sur@@ pl@@ uses in emerging markets and a deficit in the us .
but the gross flow of capital is from emerging market to emerging market , through big banks now implic@@ itly backed by the state in both the us and europe .
from the perspective of international investors , banks that are “ too big to fail ” are the perfect places to park their reserves – as long as the sovereig@@ n in question remains sol@@ vent .
but what will these banks do with the funds ?
when a similar issued emerged in the 1970 ’ s – the so-called “ recycling of oil sur@@ pl@@ uses ” – banks in western financial centers extended loans to latin america , communist poland , and communist roman@@ ia .
that was not a good idea , as it led to a massive ( for the time ) debt crisis in 1982 .
we are now heading for something similar , but on a larger scale .
the banks and other financial players have every incentive to load up on risk as we head into the cycle ; they get the upside ( wall street compen@@ sation this year is set to break records again ) and the down@@ side goes to taxpa@@ yers .
the “ currency wars ” themselves are merely a skir@@ mis@@ h .
the big problem is that the core of the world ’ s financial system has become unstable , and reck@@ less ris@@ k-@@ taking will once again lead to great coll@@ ateral damage .
breaking the who ’ s glass ceiling
toronto / new york – this year , the world health organization will ele@@ ct a new direc@@ tor-@@ general .
last september , who member states nomin@@ ated six candidates for the position : te@@ dro@@ s ad@@ han@@ om ghe@@ bre@@ y@@ es@@ us , fla@@ via bu@@ stre@@ o , philippe dou@@ ste@@ -@@ bla@@ zy , david nab@@ arr@@ o , s@@ ania nis@@ ht@@ ar , and mi@@ kl@@ ó@@ s sz@@ ó@@ c@@ sk@@ a .
on january 25 , the who executive board will short@@ list three candidates ; and in may , the world health assembly will ele@@ ct one of those candidates to succeed margaret chan .
all of the candidates have presented a vision for how they would lead the organization , and we personally know and admire several of them .
but , ultimately , we believe that ghe@@ bre@@ y@@ es@@ us is the most qualified person for the job .
our end@@ or@@ se@@ ment is based on three consider@@ ations that are important in any hir@@ ing process , and especially for a position such as this : the candidate ’ s past achievements , leadership style , and the diversity that he or she brings to the table .
with respect to the first consideration , ghe@@ bre@@ y@@ es@@ us has a proven track record of success .
as ethiopia ’ s health minister from 2005 to 2012 , he champi@@ oned the interests of all of the country ’ s citizens , and streng@@ th@@ ened primar@@ y-@@ care services .
he created 3,@@ 500 health centers and 16@@ ,000 health posts , and dramatically expanded the heal@@ th-@@ care workforce by building more medical schools and deplo@@ ying more 3@@ 8,000 commun@@ ity-@@ based health extension workers .
ghe@@ bre@@ y@@ es@@ us ’ s efforts now serve as a model that other countries seek to emu@@ late as they try to achieve universal health coverage for their citizens .
he is the only candidate who has achieved such results at a national level .
ghe@@ bre@@ y@@ es@@ us is also a long@@ time champion and advocate of gender equality and the rights of women and girls .
in fact , his efforts to streng@@ then ethiopia ’ s health system played a crucial role in more than doubling the percentage of ethiop@@ ian women with access to contra@@ ception , and in reducing maternal mortality by 75 % .
when ghe@@ bre@@ y@@ es@@ us was ethiopia ’ s foreign minister from 2012 to 20@@ 16 , he gained extensive diplo@@ matic experience , not least by leading negotiations for the add@@ is ab@@ aba action agenda , the international community ’ s plan to finance the united nations sustainable development goals .
this same kn@@ ack for diplomacy is now needed to bring who member states together for cooperative action on collective health challenges .
ghe@@ bre@@ y@@ es@@ us ’ s leadership style is also perfectly su@@ ited for this role : he speaks last , and encoura@@ ges others to share their views .
he also knows how to spot and nurture talent , and how to bring the best out of the people around him .
he would und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly boost organi@@ zational mor@@ ale and motivate the staff to deliver maximum value and efficiency – to the benefit of all member states and their citizens .
and while he is a recep@@ tive listen@@ er , he is also decisi@@ ve , which is an attribute for the leader of the world ’ s foremost health institution , especially during global publi@@ c-@@ health emergen@@ cies .
then there is ghe@@ bre@@ y@@ es@@ us ’ s extensive leadership experience within global health institutions .
as board chair of the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis , and malaria between 2009 and 2011 , and as chair of the roll back malaria partnership between 2007 and 2009 , ghe@@ bre@@ y@@ es@@ us pushed through sweeping changes that dramatically improved both organizations ’ operations .
what ’ s more , he helped them raise recor@@ d-@@ breaking financial commit@@ ments from donors : $ 1@@ 1.@@ 7 billion for the global fund , and $ 3 billion for roll back malaria .
this is precisely the kind experience and expertise that the who needs in today ’ s global health environment , and it explains why the african union has officially end@@ or@@ sed ghe@@ bre@@ y@@ es@@ us ’ s candi@@ d@@ acy .
amazingly , in its almost 70-@@ year history , the who has never had a direc@@ tor-@@ general from africa .
this fact alone is not a reason to pick a candidate ; but in ghe@@ bre@@ y@@ es@@ us ’ s case , his direct experience working in developing countries makes him uniquely qualified to tackle our toughest global health problems , which tend to hit developing countries the hardest .
sustainable development is truly achie@@ vable only when leaders of global institutions are from the communities most affected by those institutions ’ work .
ghe@@ bre@@ y@@ es@@ us ’ s candi@@ d@@ acy presents the who with an historic opportunity , which its executive board should sei@@ ze on january 25 .
who is gordon brown ?
at long last , gordon brown is taking over from tony blair as britain ’ s prime minister , thus atta@@ ining his life-@@ long ambition , as if by right .
he has not been elected by anyone – not by the lab@@ our party , and not by britain ’ s voters ; he has merely come into an inher@@ it@@ ance that he has long thought was his due .
how , then , will brown acquire legiti@@ macy as britain ’ s new leader ?
the one thing that is clear is that he will not gain legiti@@ macy if he offers only more of what blair has been dis@@ hing up for the past ten years .
brown ’ s second problem is the mirror image of the first .
as a senior member of blair ’ s government throughout its ten@@ ure , he shares responsibility for everything that blair has done .
political comm@@ ent@@ ators sometimes claim to detect important differences in their underlying political attitudes .
however , in practice , brown has remained in the shadows , sk@@ ill@@ fully managing the economy , but remaining silent and en@@ ig@@ matic on vital political issues , and apparently end@@ or@@ sing everything blair did .
if brown is to gain legiti@@ macy , he must offer something new ; but he can do that only by distingu@@ ishing himself from the blair legacy in clearly percep@@ tible – and therefore fairly radical – ways .
this will be a difficult trick to pull off .
perhaps the single most important domestic question brown faces concerns where he stands on the balance between the free market and the claims of social policy .
blair ’ s government moved the lab@@ our party a long way to the right of its traditional priorities of protecting the under@@ privileged , and to justify the change he re-@@ named the party “ new lab@@ our . ”
in many ways , the blair government ’ s support of free-@@ market policies turned out to be a sh@@ re@@ w@@ d and productive shift .
britain ’ s economy grew more ste@@ adily and rapidly than it had done for several generations , and the tax revenue generated by growth enabled the government to pour money into education and the national health service .
but this has come at a price , or rather several prices .
first , inequality has grown at both ends of the income scale .
at the bottom , the proportion of the population with an income below the poverty line increased from 13 % at the start of blair ’ s government to 20 % now .
that situation is much worse among ethnic min@@ orities .
and , despite the government ’ s efforts , childhood poverty also has increased under blair .
at the top , the incomes of the mega-@@ rich have so@@ ared , with predictable reper@@ cus@@ sions , especially in the property market .
public concern about this issue has been made much worse by claims that the rich get even richer by paying little tax .
there was a time when brown was thought to be a belie@@ ver in traditional lab@@ our party values .
was it true ?
is it true now ?
what will he say about inequality ?
unfortunately , blair and his government are perceived to be tain@@ ted by some of the less attractive features of free-@@ market capitalism .
blair himself seems to prefer to have “ friends ” who are very rich and who will l@@ end him their holiday v@@ illas in tus@@ c@@ any .
this “ clo@@ sen@@ ess ” has led the police to investigate claims that some lab@@ our party donors have been rewar@@ ded with political hon@@ ors .
in short , blair ’ s government exu@@ des an aura of s@@ lea@@ ze and cr@@ ony@@ ism .
can brown show that he is different ?
the worst part of blair ’ s legacy , of course , is the war in iraq .
many people predicted , and everyone can now see , that the decision to invade was a disa@@ strous error ; that it is having catastrophic consequences , not just for iraq , but also for the middle east generally ; and that it has seriously damaged the moral standing of the united states and britain .
the most critical issue facing brown is whether he choo@@ ses to distance himself from blair ’ s self-@@ satisfied and del@@ usi@@ onal claim that the invasion of iraq was “ the right thing to do . ”
britain has already reduced its forces in southern iraq , and is on course to reduce them still further as they hand over “ security ” to the ira@@ qi police and military .
in reality , of course , the civil and guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ a war under way in the rest of iraq means that any security in the south can only be a temporary illusion .
the choice facing brown is whether to cling sil@@ ently to the existing policy , in the fu@@ tile hope that the problem will go away , or explicitly recognize britain ’ s share in the disaster .
this is partly a question of what to do now in iraq ; but it is also a question of britain ’ s relationship with the us .
with hin@@ d@@ sight , it is clear that britain ’ s participation in the iraq war was driven sol@@ ely by blair ’ s determination to stick lim@@ pe@@ t-@@ like to the us .
brown believes , and has said , that britain must always be close friends with america ; and obviously that is the right thing to believe and say .
but is he prepared to make clear that there is a difference between being close friends and going into an illegal and disa@@ strous war just to please george w bush ?
so far , there is no indication that he will .
while he has publicly regre@@ tted the errors in british intelligence about saddam hussein , that is merely a way of shifting the blame from the government to the intelligence services .
but it was not the intelligence services that decided to go to war ; it was tony blair , with the support of gordon brown .
the boston paradox
moscow – whose fault is it that the boston marathon was bom@@ bed ?
is russia to blame for 250 years of trying to incorporate the muslim north cau@@ cas@@ us nations , like the che@@ chens and da@@ ge@@ stan@@ is , first into the c@@ z@@ ars ’ christian orthodo@@ x empire , then into the soviet union , and now into president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin ’ s all-@@ controlling russian state ?
or is radical islam the only explanation we need , both in russia and the west ?
the attack by t@@ amer@@ lan and d@@ zho@@ k@@ har ts@@ ar@@ na@@ e@@ v has inv@@ ari@@ ably e@@ lic@@ ited compar@@ is@@ ons to the sau@@ di@@ -@@ born terrorists who struck the united states on september 11 , 2001 , or to the pakistani immigrant fa@@ is@@ al sha@@ h@@ z@@ ad , who attempted to set off a car bomb in times square in 2010 .
others have suggested that the 2@@ 6@@ -year-old t@@ amer@@ lan , an ethnic che@@ chen , may have witnessed the russian / che@@ chen war of 1999 , or russia ’ s brutal efforts to paci@@ fy insur@@ gent fighting in the north cau@@ cas@@ us .
overwhelmed by the russian army ’ s ru@@ th@@ lessness , it is said , he and his teenage brother chose to spread the violence to us soil .
the problem with this explanation , of course , is that the ts@@ ar@@ na@@ e@@ v brothers were from ky@@ r@@ gy@@ z@@ stan .
they never lived in che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya , and only briefly passed through da@@ gest@@ an in the early 2000 ’ s .
their ties with the region are those of the diaspora .
che@@ chen president ram@@ z@@ an k@@ ad@@ y@@ ro@@ v , a former rebel , immediately said that the brothers had nothing to do with his republic .
d@@ zho@@ k@@ har , now 19 , was only eight years old when the family moved to the us – sett@@ ling in cambridge , massachusetts – and by many accounts he was a reasonably well-@@ adju@@ sted americ@@ an-@@ immigrant .
he recently began to identify with his religious and ethnic origins , and was experiencing academic difficulties at university , but he was well ver@@ sed in multiple us sub@@ cultures .
t@@ amer@@ lan , a box@@ er almost good enough to turn professional , was married to an american christian woman who converted to islam and became obser@@ v@@ ant with her husband .
pati@@ mat su@@ lei@@ man@@ o@@ va , the ts@@ ar@@ na@@ ev@@ s ’ aunt in da@@ gest@@ an , explained that her older ne@@ phe@@ w never pra@@ yed before he went to america at age 16 .
“ he didn ’ t even know what islam was , ” she told cnn .
in her view , t@@ amer@@ lan ’ s radi@@ c@@ alization was made in america .
essentially , the young men ’ s stories are not so different from america ’ s home grown “ lone wol@@ ves , ” typically white and equally dis@@ en@@ chan@@ ted , who have so often shed blood in the us .
the difference is that white men are not collectively bl@@ amed for the atro@@ cities .
adam lan@@ za in new@@ town , connecticut , or james hol@@ mes in aurora , colorado , are not viewed as part of a “ suspicious ” religious or ethnic group .
even when non-@@ muslim white men launch explicitly terrorist attacks – for example , oklahoma city bomber timothy mc@@ vei@@ gh , who murdered 16@@ 8 people in 1995 , or the “ unab@@ om@@ ber ” the@@ od@@ ore kac@@ zy@@ n@@ ski – their offen@@ ses are typically regarded as isolated la@@ w-@@ en@@ for@@ cement issues , not as terrorism .
by contrast , dar@@ ker@@ -@@ skinn@@ ed terrorism suspe@@ cts , especially muslims , are considered agents of larger conspi@@ ra@@ cies that require military involvement and justify human-@@ rights viol@@ ations .
the initial call by various us con@@ gress@@ men to pro@@ sec@@ ute d@@ zho@@ k@@ har ts@@ ar@@ na@@ e@@ v as an “ enemy com@@ bat@@ ant ” is a case in point .
never mind that ts@@ ar@@ na@@ e@@ v is a natur@@ alized us citizen , and thus cannot be tried by military tribun@@ als , or that he was captured on us soil , not on a battle@@ field .
but that has not altered americans ’ tendency to gener@@ alize invi@@ di@@ ously about peoples and countries .
indeed , so rapid was the vili@@ fication of che@@ chens that the c@@ ze@@ ch republic ’ s ambassador to the us felt comp@@ elled to issue a statement aimed at preventing any con@@ fusion among americans about his country ’ s involvement .
in russia , too , the fall@@ out is per@@ ni@@ cious .
the ts@@ ar@@ na@@ ev@@ s ’ attack super@@ fi@@ cially appears to justify pu@@ tin ’ s nation@@ alist politics in the north cau@@ cas@@ us , and to l@@ end cre@@ dence to his argument that russia ’ s two wars against che@@ chen independence – from 1994 to 1996 and in 1999 – were wa@@ ged in the name of national security .
in this sense , the boston bomb@@ ings have been a diplo@@ matic gift to him .
but just about the only thing that seems clear about this mur@@ der@@ ous aff@@ air is that utterly ali@@ en@@ ated young men of any religion or ethni@@ city might suddenly rebel viol@@ ently .
d@@ zho@@ k@@ har ts@@ ar@@ na@@ e@@ v ’ s reluctant reje@@ ction of the materi@@ alistic american life – even after the bom@@ bing , he continued to tweet , attend campus parties , and go to the gy@@ m – appears to have been con@@ soli@@ dated by what indeed could have been his older brother ’ s res@@ ent@@ ment of pu@@ tin ’ s brutal reas@@ ser@@ tion of control in the north cau@@ cas@@ us .
in that case , however , the boston bomb@@ ings appear to present a paradox .
while the ts@@ ar@@ na@@ e@@ v brothers may have obje@@ cted to the supposed van@@ ity of the secular state , there is another sense in which they might be right that russia and the west are not so different from each other .
just as russia must deal with a growing wave of fundament@@ alism that its own policies have fu@@ eled , the summary con@@ dem@@ nation of muslims in america will breed more ali@@ en@@ ation and re@@ tribu@@ tion from within .
after all , the attacks on the ma@@ dri@@ d train system in 2004 , and on london ’ s publi@@ c-@@ transport system in 2005 , were not carried out by saudi or taliban immigr@@ ants , but by young men born and raised in spain and the united kingdom .
for years afterward , the us was held out as an exception – a country in which young men , whatever their background , felt truly at home .
the boston marathon bomb@@ ings , like so many acts of mass violence in america , should retire that view once and for all .
who is to blame ?
princeton – now that the economic crisis looks less threatening ( at least for the moment ) , and fore@@ ca@@ sters are sp@@ ying “ green shoots ” of recovery , an ever more en@@ com@@ passing blame game is unfolding .
the financial crisis provides an apparently endless opportunity for un@@ mas@@ king dec@@ eit , mal@@ fe@@ as@@ ance , and corruption .
but we are not sure quite who and what should be un@@ ma@@ sk@@ ed .
leading bankers were initially the most obvious cul@@ pri@@ ts .
they presi@@ ded over institutions that made large profits for a substantial period of time by mis@@ pricing risk , and then argued for public support on the grounds that they were too big to fail .
they appeared arrogant and over@@ paid , and were easily demon@@ ized .
but what about the political process ?
why were the banks not more closely controlled and better regulated ?
it is not that politicians were “ bought ” in a simple sense ; rather , they convinced themselves that financial innovation opened the gate to greater general prosperity , increased home ownership , and , of course , popular support in elections .
governments are now vulnerable , and politicians are under attack almost everywhere .
admini@@ strations have collapsed in the c@@ ze@@ ch republic , hung@@ ary , iceland , and ireland .
riots and paraly@@ zing strikes have cri@@ p@@ pled thailand , france , and greece .
in kuwait , the government dis@@ missed parliament .
britain is convul@@ sed by a sc@@ andal about parli@@ am@@ entary expen@@ ses that has no equivalent since the attacks on “ old corruption ” in the early n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth century .
rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ations after financial crises have a long history , and they re@@ cu@@ r in regular cycles .
the stock exchange boom of the early 18@@ 70 ’ s was followed by collapse in 18@@ 73 and a wit@@ ch-@@ hunt for those responsible .
in 190@@ 7 , j.@@ p. morgan was first viewed as the sa@@ vi@@ or of the market , and then as the enemy of the common@@ we@@ al .
in the 19@@ 30 ’ s , bankers and finance ministers were accused .
but for the rest of the twen@@ tieth century , the bac@@ klas@@ h cycle seemed to have stopped .
today the attacks are not limited to the political and financial establishment .
cri@@ tics are trying to identify the ideas as well as the interests that were responsible for financial and economic dys@@ function .
in this respect , the contemporary crisis is unlike the historical analo@@ gies , in that it looks as if financial innovation was driven by a set of intellectual and even technological innovations .
since it is an economic crisis , most people seeking its intellectual roots are temp@@ ted to begin with economists , who , with a few exceptions , look particularly dis@@ credi@@ ted .
the founder of the rational expectations revolution , robert lucas , is end@@ lessly quot@@ ed as having stated in 2003 in his presidential address to the american economic association that the “ central problem of depressi@@ on-@@ prevention has been solved , for all practical purposes , and has in fact been solved for many decades . ”
it is also clear that academic economists had an impact on policy .
larry su@@ mmers , now the highly influential director of president barack obama ’ s national economic council , concluded as a young economist that “ financial and mon@@ etary sho@@ cks are less important sources of depression than we had suspected . ” if the economy was fool@@ proof , and if so many good policy options existed to deal with crisis and distress , there was less need to avoid mistakes .
things could always be set right retro@@ spec@@ tively .
other academic disciplines have looked rather s@@ mu@@ gly at the public humili@@ ation of their colleagues in economics .
the non-@@ mathematical appear to have their reven@@ ge , as the per@@ ils of over-@@ reli@@ ance on complex symbolic notation and ar@@ cane formu@@ la@@ e are rel@@ ent@@ lessly exposed .
in fact , developments or fashi@@ ons in other academic disciplines and also in the general culture contributed at least as much to a willingness to engage in absurd risks and to provide and accept valu@@ ations of complex and inherently un@@ fa@@ thom@@ able se@@ curi@@ ties .
the general cultural developments are sometimes ter@@ med post-@@ modernis@@ m , which involves the replacement of reason by intuition , feeling , and all@@ usion .
but post-@@ modernis@@ m has itself been generated by technology , with which it has a deeply ambiguous relationship .
in contrast to a steam engine or an old-fashioned automobile , whose operations were easily comprehen@@ sible , modern automobiles or airplanes are so complicated that their oper@@ ators have no idea how the technology they are using actually works .
the internet has created a world in which strict logic is less important than the juxta@@ position of striking images .
post-@@ modernis@@ m moves away from the rational culture of the so-called “ modern era . ”
many people are finding more analo@@ gies with medieval life , in which humans were surrounded by processes that they found difficult to compre@@ hend .
as a result , they thought they lived in a world populated by demon@@ s and mysterious forces .
the recent era of global finance – perhaps we should speak of it as being past ? – differ@@ ed from the financial surge of a century ago .
its cultural manife@@ stations also appeared to be novel .
it was playful , all@@ u@@ sive , and ed@@ gy – in short , post-@@ modern .
it treated tradition and history not as a constra@@ int , but as a source of ironic reference .
at the era ’ s height , major financial players built vastly expensive colle@@ ctions of highly abstract modern art .
a post-@@ modern negle@@ ct or dis@@ da@@ in for reality generated the sense that the whole world was constantly shifting and mal@@ le@@ able , and might be as transi@@ ent and meaningless as stock quot@@ ations .
an alliance was formed between financial experts who thought they were selling truly innovative ideas , a political elite that end@@ or@@ sed the philosophy of “ regulation li@@ te , ” and a cultural climate that pushed experimentation and the reje@@ ction of traditional values .
the result was that every sort of value – including financial values – came to be seen as arbitrary and fundamentally absurd .
when in@@ comprehen@@ sion no longer produces new heights of prosperity , but rather economic collapse and failure , it is not surprising that it turns to anger .
finding out who is to blame becomes more and more like the late medieval and early modern search for wit@@ ches : a way of making sense of a dis@@ or@@ derly and hostile universe .
cambridge – you don ’ t have to break a sweat to be a finance skeptic these days .
so let ’ s remind ourselves how compelling the logic of the financial innovation that led us to our current predi@@ cam@@ ent seemed not too long ago .
who wouldn ’ t want credit markets to serve the cause of home ownership ?
so we start by introducing some real competition into the mortgage len@@ ding business .
we allow non-@@ banks to make home loans and let them offer creative , more affordable mort@@ g@@ ages to pro@@ spe@@ ctive home@@ owners not well served by conventional len@@ ders .
then we enable these loans to be po@@ ol@@ ed and packaged into se@@ curi@@ ties that can be sold to investors , reducing risk in the process .
we di@@ v@@ vy up the stream of payments on these home loans further into tran@@ ches of var@@ ying risk , comp@@ ens@@ ating holders of the riski@@ er kind with higher interest rates .
we then call on credit rating agencies to certi@@ fy that the less risky of these mort@@ ga@@ ge-@@ backed se@@ curi@@ ties are safe enough for pension funds and insurance companies to invest in .
in case anyone is still nervous , we create deriva@@ tives that allow investors to purchase insurance against default by issu@@ ers of those se@@ curi@@ ties .
if you wanted to show@@ case the benefits of financial innovation , you could not have come up with better arrangements .
thanks to them , millions of poorer and hi@@ ther@@ to exclu@@ ded families became home@@ owners , investors made high returns , and financial inter@@ medi@@ aries po@@ ck@@ eted the fees and com@@ missions .
it might have worked like a dream – and until about a year and a half ago , many finan@@ ci@@ ers , economists , and policymakers thought that it did .
then it all came crash@@ ing down .
the crisis that eng@@ ul@@ fed financial markets in recent months has buried wall street and hum@@ bled the united states .
the near $ 1 trillion bail@@ out of troubled financial institutions that the us treas@@ ury has had to mount makes emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market mel@@ t@@ downs – such as mexico ’ s “ pes@@ o ” crisis in 1994 or the asian financial crisis of 199@@ 7-@@ 1998 – look like foot@@ notes by comparison .
but where did it all go wrong ?
if our reme@@ dies do not target the true underlying sources of the crisis , our new@@ found regul@@ atory ze@@ al might end up killing useful sorts of financial innovation , along with the toxic kind .
the trouble is that there is no shortage of suspe@@ cts .
was the problem uns@@ cru@@ pul@@ ous mortgage len@@ ders who de@@ vised credit terms – such as “ te@@ aser ” interest rates and pre@@ payment pen@@ alties – that led uns@@ us@@ pe@@ cting bor@@ ro@@ wers into a debt trap ?
perhaps , but these strategies would not have made sense for len@@ ders unless they believed that house prices would continue to rise .
so maybe the cul@@ pr@@ it is the housing bubble that developed in the late 1990 ’ s , and the rel@@ uc@@ tance of alan green@@ span ’ s federal reserve to def@@ late it .
even so , the explosion in the quantity of coll@@ ater@@ alized debt obli@@ ga@@ tions and similar se@@ curi@@ ties went far beyond what was needed to sustain mortgage len@@ ding .
that was also true of credit default swa@@ ps , which became an instrument of specu@@ lation instead of insurance and reached an asto@@ unding $ 62 trillion in volume .
so the crisis might not have reached the scale that it did without financial institutions of all types lever@@ aging themselves to the hil@@ t in pursuit of higher returns .
but what , then , were the credit rating agencies doing ?
had they done their job properly and issued tim@@ ely warn@@ ings about the risks , these markets would not have sucked in nearly as many investors as they eventually did .
isn ’ t this the crux of the matter ?
or perhaps the true cul@@ pri@@ ts lie halfway around the world .
high-@@ saving asian households and dollar-@@ ho@@ ar@@ ding foreign central banks produced a global savings “ gl@@ ut , ” which pushed real interest rates into negative territory , in turn sto@@ king the us housing bubble while sending finan@@ ci@@ ers on ever-@@ riski@@ er vent@@ ures with bor@@ rowed money .
macro@@ economic policymakers could have gotten their act together and acted in time to un@@ wind those large and unsustainable curr@@ ent-@@ account im@@ balances .
then there would not have been so much liqui@@ dity slo@@ shing around waiting for an accident to happen .
but perhaps what really got us into the mess is that the us treas@@ ury played its hand poorly as the crisis un@@ folded .
as bad as things were , what caused credit markets to sei@@ ze up was treas@@ ury secretary henry pau@@ l@@ son ’ s ref@@ us@@ al to ba@@ il out le@@ hman brothers .
immediately after that decision , short-term funding for even the best-@@ capit@@ alized firms virtually collapsed and the entire financial system simply became dys@@ functional .
in view of what was about to happen , it might have been better for pau@@ l@@ son to hold his nose and do with le@@ hman what he had already done with bear ste@@ ar@@ ns and would have had to do in a few days with a@@ ig : save them with taxpa@@ yer money .
wall street might have survived , and us taxpa@@ yers might have been spar@@ ed even larger bills .
perhaps it is fu@@ tile to look for the single cause without which the financial system would not have blown up in our faces .
a com@@ for@@ ting thought – if you still want to believe in financial san@@ ity – is that this was a case of a “ perfect storm , ” a rare failure that required a large number of stars to be in alig@@ nment simultaneously .
so what will the post-@@ mor@@ tem on wall street show ?
that it was a case of suicide ?
murder ?
accidental death ?
we will likely never know .
the regulations and pre@@ cau@@ tions that law@@ makers will en@@ act to prevent its recur@@ r@@ ence will therefore necessarily remain bl@@ unt and of un@@ certain effectiveness .
that is why you can be sure that we will have another major financial crisis sometime in the future , once this one has disappeared into the rec@@ esses of our memory .
you can bet your life savings on it .
in fact , you probably will .
who lost russia ?
who lost russia ?
this question remains hot@@ ly deb@@ ated in media and policy circles across the west .
the question seems to pres@@ up@@ pose , not only that russia was lost , but also that if someone in america ’ s government , the imf , or eu headquarters had been paying more attention or had devoted more resources towards helping russia ’ s government , the results would have been better .
but hardly anyone today thinks the west should have been putting more money into russia , or even that it should have been helping yel@@ ts@@ in , and now pu@@ tin , to a greater extent than it has been .
an op@@ posing cri@@ ti@@ que , favor@@ ed by some of george w. bush ’ s advis@@ ors , holds that the clinton administration tried too hard to help , not that it did not try hard enough .
there is something contradi@@ c@@ tory about using the phrase “ who lost russia ? ” to mean that the us tried too hard to help .
the har@@ sh@@ est criticism comes from those ( including some bush advis@@ ers ) who say america and the west sent money down a rat@@ -@@ hole instead of following the practice adopted to fighting some wild@@ fires b ie , standing back and letting the flames burn themselves out .
all in all , the pati@@ ently cali@@ br@@ ated approach of the last eight years has been right for the most part .
few will agree with this , probably not even those responsible for conducting russia policy over the past years .
so let me add that i do not claim that things are good in russia , nor that american and western policy had much positive effect there , nor that there isn ’ t corruption , misery , and their like in abundance across russia .
of course , the current situation for the west is more satis@@ factory , not only from where it was 10 or 20 years ago , when the soviet union ’ s fall did not appear even a remote possibility , but also from where it might have been given russia ’ s economic hard@@ ship and social inst@@ ability .
russia pulled back from hyper@@ inflation in 1995 ; it has not ve@@ ered off either toward ri@@ ght@@ wing dictator@@ ship nor back to communism ; nor has it entirely de@@ generated into an@@ arch@@ ic chaos .
this is an accompli@@ shment considering that russia never had historical experience with any sort of democracy or market system .
russia probably hasn ’ t even done as badly as ukra@@ ine , bel@@ ar@@ us , and central asia .
but i don ’ t claim that america and the west necessarily had much effect on this outcome b beyond doing what they do best : thriving domest@@ ically , and thus making others want to become free market democrats .
what happens in russia is mainly determined by russians .
consider specific policy choices faced by the west and the specific decisions made , not an imaginary menu that includes the option “ establish the rule of law first , eliminate corruption and inequality , then proceed with market reforms and aid . ”
that combination of choices was never an option .
the west ’ s choices attempted to strike a balance between too much and too little .
• appro@@ ving russian mem@@ ber@@ ship in the imf in 1992 and immediately giving it a $ 1 billion stand@@ -@@ by arrangement , with the usual conditions ;
• working closely with yel@@ ts@@ in in the run@@ -up to russia ’ s presidential election in 1996 and there@@ after , despite his personal short@@ com@@ ings and the du@@ bi@@ ous “ shar@@ es-@@ for-@@ loans ” privati@@ zations of the summer of 1995 ;
• subsequently aug@@ menting the imf len@@ ding agreement by making more resources available even though most of the conditions set previously had not been met , in particular the elimin@@ ation of un@@ sustain@@ ably large russian budget defic@@ its because of a poor@@ ly-@@ functioning national tax collection system ;
• pulling the plug in august 1998 when the imf program didn ’ t work ( much imf money having quickly flo@@ wed back out of the banking system ) , with the result that the russians immediately de@@ valued the ru@@ ble , de@@ faul@@ ted on domestic debt , and imposed controls on capital out@@ flows ( wh@@ ence contagi@@ on spread throughout the world , in the worst phase of the 199@@ 7-@@ 98 financial tur@@ mo@@ il ) ;
• adding new conditions to those required for an imf program in the lat@@ ter part of 1999 .
although the odds for success in 199@@ 1-@@ 2 were not great , the west had to try .
not to try would have sent a signal that the west would never help .
and , despite “ moral hazard , ” about which we now hear so much and which everyone agrees was greatest in respect to nu@@ clear@@ -@@ armed russia , the west did let russia default in 1998 .
this was a lesson for the world b deb@@ tors and credi@@ tors alike b that condi@@ tionality is more than mere rhetoric , and bail@@ outs are not unlimited .
europeans complain that the us used the imf as a tool for its purposes .
it may be true that the mandate of the imf , which is supposed to make decisions strictly on objective economic criteria rather than broader political goals , was stretched at times .
america , in particular , may have given russia more attention than another country would have .
but the basic imf principle of condi@@ tionality was not twisted until un@@ recogni@@ zable .
in the real world there was no other way of helping .
everyone , not just americans , has a stake in russia prosp@@ ering peac@@ efully .
in general , the gui@@ ding principle in the future should be to continue to stand ready to help russia if social and political conditions supportive of the rule of law and economic reform manifest themselves .
standing ready includes muster@@ ing more domestic support for assistance than is currently available , not whi@@ pping up anti-@@ russian feelings with supposedly new discoveries of mon@@ e@@ y-@@ la@@ under@@ ing .
but support should always be condi@@ tional on fundament@@ als .
in the end , the west must recognize that much of the time there is little that can be done .
who “ lost ” turkey ?
berlin -- turkey ’ s “ no ” last month ( a vote cast together with brazil ) to the new san@@ ctions against iran approved in the united nations security council dramatically reveals the full extent of the country ’ s e@@ str@@ ange@@ ment from the west .
are we , as many comm@@ ent@@ ators have argued , witn@@ essing the consequences of the so-called “ neo-@@ ot@@ to@@ man ” foreign policy of turkey ’ s justice and development party ( ak@@ p ) government , which is supposedly aimed at switching camps and returning to the country ’ s ori@@ ental islamic roots ?
and should things work out that way , this would be due more to a self-@@ fulfilling prophe@@ cy on the west ’ s part than to turkey ’ s policies .
in fact , turkey ’ s foreign policy , which see@@ ks to resolve existing conflicts with and within neighbor@@ ing states , and active turkish involvement there , is anything but in conflict with western interests . quite the contrary .
turkey is and should be a member of the g-@@ 20 , because , with its young , rapidly growing population it will become a very strong state economically in the twenty-@@ first century .
even today , the image of turkey as the “ sick man of europe ” is no longer accurate .
when , after the un decision , united states secretary of defense robert gates har@@ sh@@ ly criticized europeans for having contributed to this e@@ str@@ ange@@ ment by their behavior towards turkey , his un@@ diplo@@ matic frank@@ ness caused quite a sti@@ r in paris and berlin .
ever since the change in government from jacques chi@@ ra@@ c to ni@@ col@@ as sar@@ ko@@ zy in france and from ger@@ hard schrö@@ der to angel@@ a mer@@ kel in germany , turkey has been str@@ ung along and put off by the european union . indeed , in the case of c@@ yp@@ rus , the eu wasn ’ t even above breaking previous commit@@ ments vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis turkey and un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally changing jo@@ int@@ ly-@@ agreed rules .
the west , and europe in particular , really can ’ t afford to ali@@ en@@ ate turkey , considering their interests , but obje@@ ctively it is exactly this kind of e@@ str@@ ange@@ ment that follows from european policy towards turkey in the last few years .
but , rather than bin@@ ding turkey as closely as possible to europe and the west , european policy is driving turkey into the arms of russia and iran .
this kind of policy is ironic , absurd , and short@@ sighted all at once .
of course , turkey , too , is greatly dependent on integration with the west .
should it lose this , it would dra@@ stically wea@@ ken its own position vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis its potential regional partners ( and ri@@ vals ) , despite its ideal geo@@ political location .
turkey ’ s “ no ” to new san@@ ctions against iran in all likelihood will prove to be a significant error , unless prime minister re@@ ce@@ p ta@@ y@@ yi@@ p er@@ do@@ ğ@@ an can deliver a real turn@@ around in iran ’ s nuclear policy .
this , however , is highly unlikely .
many new developments have been set in motion in that entire region by the global economic crisis , and a new player , china ( a long-term plan@@ ner ) , has entered the geo@@ political stage .
europe risks running out of time , even in its own neighborhood , because active european foreign policy and a strong commitment on the part of the eu are sor@@ ely missed in all these countries .
or , as mik@@ ha@@ il gor@@ bach@@ e@@ v , that great russian stat@@ es@@ man of the last decades of the twen@@ tieth century , put it : “ life has a way of pun@@ ishing those who come too late . ”
who lost turkey ?
paris – “ who lost turkey ? ” that question , often raised in the past , has been heating up in the after@@ math of prime minister re@@ ce@@ p ta@@ y@@ yi@@ p er@@ do@@ gan ’ s emotional out@@ burst during the recent world economic forum 2009 in da@@ vos , when he ab@@ rup@@ tly left a panel he was sharing with israeli president shi@@ mon per@@ es .
and the turkish question matters greatly , because it touches on some of the most unstable and un@@ sett@@ ling of the world ’ s diplo@@ matic dispu@@ tes .
if turkey has indeed been “ lost , ” those responsible include the european union , the united states , israel , and turkey itself .
the eu ’ s growing reser@@ vations about turkey ’ s mem@@ ber@@ ship have been expressed un@@ ambigu@@ ously by french president ni@@ col@@ as sar@@ ko@@ zy .
in the us , former president george w. bush gets some of the blame because of the war in iraq .
israel , too , has played its part in turkey ’ s ali@@ en@@ ation from the west , as a result of the lebanon war of 2006 and its recent military operations in gaza .
all of these events have disturbed and dis@@ oriented turkey , and are magni@@ fied by the domestic impact of worst global economic crisis since the 19@@ 30 ’ s .
of course , turkey ’ s secular , pro-@@ western elites may still consider the eu and the us important , if not in@@ dispen@@ s@@ able , allies and partners , and they may consider islamic fundament@@ alism , hamas , he@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h , and iran real or at least potential threats .
yet they are also convinced that europe has beha@@ ved impro@@ per@@ ly toward turkey , through a combination of short-term popu@@ list refle@@ xes and the absence of a long-term strategic vision .
the turkish question is , of course , complex .
turkey ’ s geography is pre@@ domin@@ antly asian , turkey ’ s emotions are increasingly middle eastern , i.@@ e. , muslim on the israeli@@ -@@ palestinian conflict , and yet turkey ’ s elites remain resol@@ u@@ tely pro-@@ western and pro-@@ european .
but for how long ?
at the beginning of the twenty-@@ first century , when dialogue with the islamic world is one of the western world ’ s key challenges , europe would commit a historic strategic bl@@ under if it were to close its doors to turkey .
to do so would push back the inher@@ it@@ ors of the ot@@ to@@ man empire back onto an asian , muslim , and middle eastern historical trajectory .
in the question of turkish acc@@ ession to the eu , the journey matters more than the destination .
the reforms that turkey has already implemented in a very short period of time , thanks to its eu candidate status , are impressive .
should we in europe really put at risk that progress by expressing an all-@@ to@@ o-@@ audi@@ ble “ no ” ?
the eu desperately needs a strategic and diplo@@ matic partner that can significantly rein@@ force its cl@@ out in the middle east .
europe also needs the dynam@@ ism of a you@@ thful turkey .
above all , it needs the message of reconciliation sent to islam that turkey ’ s entrance into the union would represent .
of course , to want turkey “ in ” is an act of will , if not an act of faith that is in many ways counterintuitive .
most europeans do not perceive turkey as a “ european other ” but as a “ non-@@ european other . ”
even in istanbul , the most we@@ ster@@ ni@@ zed of turkish cities , as soon as one leaves the main arteries , one seems to be immersed in a middle eastern or asian culture .
israel is not in the european union , but it , too , is in great danger of losing turkey .
far from rein@@ forcing israel ’ s security , its last two military adventures , in lebanon and now in gaza , have caused further self-@@ isolation and loss of world sympathy .
nowhere has this phenomenon been stronger than in turkey , where those military es@@ ca@@ pa@@ des have stra@@ ined the two countries ’ strategic alliance almost to the breaking point .
it is too early to speak of obama ’ s policy towards turkey ; suff@@ ice it to say that in his willingness to open a respectful dialogue with islam , he is the only western leader to move in the right direction .
but can positive american gestures towards turkey , a key nato member , be sufficient to off@@ set israel ’ s in@@ sensitive , if not reck@@ less , policies ?
the answer is unclear .
turkey , too shares some of the responsibility for this moun@@ ting process of e@@ str@@ ange@@ ment . er@@ do@@ gan ’ s behavior in da@@ vos was , at the very least , ir@@ responsible .
he may have gained popul@@ arity back home , but in today ’ s difficult economic times , the temp@@ tations of cheap popu@@ li@@ sm are more dangerous than ever .
one does not play ligh@@ tly with matches next to a pile of dry wood .
who needs a flat tax ?
washington , dc – with america ’ s republican presidential candidates lining up to de@@ clare their fe@@ alty to a flat tax – a system of person@@ al-@@ income tax@@ ation that ass@@ esses a single rate for all – oppon@@ ents have focused on why it is a bad idea to raise taxes on the poor in order to reduce them for the wealthy .
but , if a flat tax is such a bad idea , why have so many countries embraced it ?
a careful study of these countries – mainly post-@@ communist countries in eastern europe and a sma@@ tter@@ ing of tiny micro-@@ states worldwide – suggests that there are three main reasons . first , some countries are so relatively poor and lac@@ king in domestic capital that they op@@ t to drop rates in order to attract foreign investors .
other countries are so small and in@@ effective at collecting revenue that they cannot afford a progressive tax system .
finally , some countries are so corrupt that they have to offer the wealthy a huge rate cut to get them to pay any taxes at all .
the united states , like other developed countries , does not suffer from any of these conditions ( yet ) , so it is not clear why it needs a flat tax .
the for@@ mer@@ ly communist countries of eastern europe that have adopted a flat tax – including bulg@@ aria , the c@@ ze@@ ch republic , est@@ onia , lat@@ via , li@@ thu@@ ania , ma@@ ce@@ don@@ ia , roman@@ ia , slo@@ v@@ ak@@ ia , and ukra@@ ine , among others – sor@@ ely lack investment capital .
whether on the european union ’ s door@@ step or just inside , they compete for the attention of foreign direct investors , for whom a flat tax provides an important signal : you are welcome , we will not steal your money , and you can keep what you earn .
for developed countries that already have capital and a track record of in@@ ward investment , “ the appeal of the flat tax is con@@ sequ@@ ently less , ” as a report by the international mon@@ etary fund conclu@@ des .
thus , the flat tax has not been adopted in any developed countries , or in china .
the other countries that have embraced a flat tax are small or micro-@@ states : jama@@ ica , tu@@ val@@ u , gren@@ ada , mauritius , ti@@ mor@@ -@@ le@@ ste , be@@ li@@ ze , and se@@ y@@ ch@@ elles .
the only ( partial ) exception to this rule is para@@ guay , which adopted a flat tax in 2010 .
here , flat@@ -@@ tax advoc@@ ates ’ administra@@ tiv@@ e-@@ simplicity arguments have some tra@@ ction .
if a country is so small that it cannot develop a tax administration effective enough to manage a fair system of progressive tax@@ ation , then a flat tax may make sense .
moreover , some small countries have other sources of revenue , so the benefit of imple@@ menting a progressive tax system does not justify the cost .
tu@@ val@@ u ’ s government , for example , deri@@ ves nearly 10 % of its revenues from the sale of rights to its “ .@@ tv ” internet domain name , which brings in about $ 2 million annu@@ ally .
countries that are just slightly larger can afford to collect income taxes in a fair@@ er way .
finally , if a country ’ s public institutions are in the thr@@ all of oli@@ g@@ arch@@ s who are ac@@ custom@@ ed to stealing with im@@ pun@@ ity from the public till , a flat tax may be the only way to indu@@ ce the wealthy to pay any tax at all .
thus , in 2001 russia became the first large state to adopt a flat tax , reducing the top margin@@ al rate from 30 % to 13 % .
in 2003 , ukra@@ ine dropped its top rate from 40 % to 13 % .
in nearly all countries that have introduced a flat tax , government revenues from income tax have declined .
that is why its adoption is often associated with an increase in valu@@ e-@@ added tax rates ( as has occurred throughout eastern europe ) .
in the us , the republican presidential candidate her@@ man cain ’ s “ 9@@ -@@ 9@@ -@@ 9 ” plan calls for a 9 % rate for personal and corporate taxes , together with a new 9 % national sales tax .
a country ’ s tax system reflects its institutional capacity , economic circumstances , and distribution of political power .
if the us were to become the first developed country to experiment with a flat tax , that shift would tend to confirm what many suspect but hope is not true : that america is broke , desperate for in@@ ward investment , in@@ compe@@ tently governed , and increasingly ruled by a self-@@ regar@@ ding oli@@ g@@ arch@@ ic elite .
who needs the humanities ?
war@@ wick , uk – nowadays , in country after country , policymakers have become obsessed with the need to streng@@ then science education .
but what about the humanities – all those disciplines ( literature , history , languages , and so forth ) whose relevance to economic competi@@ tiveness is not so obvious ?
we need the humanities only if we are committed to the idea of humanity .
if the humanities have become obsolete , then it may be that humanity is losing its sali@@ ence .
i do not mean that we are becoming “ less human ” in the sense of “ in@@ humane . ”
if anything , we live in a time when traditionally human-@@ centered concerns like “ rights ” have been extended to animals , if not nature as a whole .
rather , the problem is whether there is anything distinctive about being human that makes special demands of higher education .
i believe that the answer continues to be yes .
today , it sounds old-fashioned to describe the university ’ s purpose as being to “ cultivate ” people , as if it were a glori@@ fied finishing school .
however , once we set aside its eli@@ tist history , there remains a strong element of truth to this idea , especially when applied to the humanities .
although we now think of academic disciplines , including the humanities , as being “ resear@@ ch-@@ led , ” this under@@ states the university ’ s historic role in conver@@ ting the primate homo sapiens into a creature whose interests , aspirations , and achievements extend beyond successful sexual reproduction .
what was originally called the “ liberal arts ” provided the skills necessary for this transformation .
by sub@@ mit@@ ting to a common regime of speaking , writing , reading , observing , and calculating , the “ upright ape ” acquired the capacity to reason in public .
this enabled first him and then her to command authority regardless of birth , resul@@ ting in the for@@ ging of networks and even institutions whose benefits cut deeply across blood@@ lines .
we too easily forget that our hetero@@ gene@@ ous societies rely on at least a water@@ ed-@@ down version of this training to maintain political and economic order .
the university began with the humanities at its heart , but today it is playing cat@@ ch@@ -up with the natural sciences .
this is largely because the natural sciences have most closely imit@@ ated the productivity measures associated with industry .
the result is a “ bigger is better ” mentality that stres@@ ses ever more publi@@ cations , patents , and cit@@ ations .
yet , this agenda tends to be pursu@@ ed without much concern for how – or if – these measures feed into something of greater social , cultural , and even economic relevance .
the science c@@ itation index , originally designed to help researchers disc@@ ern aggregate trends in increasingly complex subject do@@ ma@@ ins sciences , has helped measure productivity .
but now these trends are routinely converted into norms against which the performance of particular universities , de@@ partments , and even individual researchers is jud@@ ged .
what is most easily measured has become confused with what is most worth measuring .
but , more profoundly , this entire line of thinking negle@@ cts the distin@@ ctly transformative capacity of the knowledge in which the humanities speci@@ alizes .
an adequate assessment of this capacity requires looking at its multipli@@ er effects .
as with john may@@ n@@ ard key@@ nes ’ s notion that returns on public investment must be measured as the long-term consequence of other investments that it stimul@@ ates across the economy and society , so , too , with the knowledge generated by the humanities .
this idea is lost in today ’ s cost accounting for universities , which tre@@ ats what tran@@ spir@@ es between teacher and student in the classroom as ak@@ in to what happens between producer and consumer in the market .
in both cases , it is assumed that the value of the ex@@ changed good is decided shortly after its delivery according to how it satis@@ fies an immediate need .
not surprisingly , students value their degree by the first job it gets them rather than the life it prepar@@ es them for over the next half-@@ century .
today , it is hard to believe that in the he@@ y@@ day of the welfare state , universities were both more elite and more publicly funded than they are today .
back then , it was assumed that the benefits of academic training acc@@ ru@@ ed not only , or even primarily , to those who experienced it but also , and more importantly , to the rest of the population , whose lives were vari@@ ously enrich@@ ed by the application of the arts and sciences .
of course , this enrich@@ ment included such practical benefits as medical breakthroughs and labor@@ -@@ saving technologies .
but the enrich@@ ment provided by the humanities was no less enduring , though its sub@@ t@@ ler nature makes it harder to track .
nevertheless , to parap@@ hr@@ ase key@@ nes , every time we turn on the radio or television , read a newspaper , pick up a novel , or watch a movie , we are in the thr@@ all of one or more dead human@@ ists who set the terms of reference through which we see the world .
in its long history as the premi@@ er form of academic knowledge , the humanities were frequently criticized for their sub@@ ver@@ sive character .
that some would now question whether the humanities have any impact at all merely reflects the crude and short-@@ sighted way in which the value of academic knowledge is measured and jud@@ ged today .
perhaps that be@@ fits creatures whose lives are “ soli@@ tary , poor , nasty , bru@@ tish , and short , ” to recall thomas hob@@ bes ’ description of the state of nature . but it does a grave injustice to those of us who still aspi@@ re to full-@@ fle@@ dged humanity .
who needs the social sciences ?
why are the social sciences so much more at risk of having their budgets cut than the other two great bodies of academic knowledge , the humanities and the natural sciences ?
former british prime minister margaret th@@ at@@ cher not@@ ori@@ ously proposed that the field simply does not exist : there is no such thing as society , she cla@@ imed .
others point to the re@@ struc@@ turing of university social science de@@ partments .
but the expansion of business schools arguably te@@ sti@@ fies to the continued vi@@ tality of the social sciences .
nor is it true that the social sciences bel@@ ab@@ or the obvious , as is sometimes said .
on the contrary , today &apos;s common@@ places were yesterday &apos;s innovations .
if you compare the concepts used to frame newspaper edi@@ tor@@ i@@ als today and ten or more years ago , you will find the deep - but un@@ acknowled@@ ged - impact of the social sciences .
the influence may be regre@@ tted , but at least it is registered .
still , where are the social sciences in the vast conversation over &quot; human nature &quot; that has been promp@@ ted by recent advances in cognitive neuroscience , behavioral genetics , and evolutionary psychology ?
check out the elaborate and informa@@ tive website ( www.@@ ed@@ ge@@ .org ) devoted to the promotion of a &quot; third culture &quot; that bridges the humanities and the natural sciences .
social scientists are con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous by their absence .
but what difference would their presence make ?
it is often assumed that everyone reco@@ ils at the prospect that there are genetic limits to our capacity for change .
actually , only those im@@ bu@@ ed with the optimistic spirit of social science reco@@ il .
everyone else is relieved .
in the &quot; third culture &quot; best seller the blank slate : the modern denial of human nature , steven pinker says that we may need to admit a natural scientific basis for what human@@ ists have for centuries called &quot; fate . &quot;
in other words , the configuration of our brains and genes may ultimately be out of our control , however deeply we come to understand them .
pinker &apos;s message will appeal to those eager to avoid political reforms that would compe@@ l a greater sense of collective responsibility .
after all , the social sciences historically offered empiri@@ cal support and spiritual hope for just such reforms , which are increasingly dis@@ missed as &quot; utop@@ ian . &quot;
by contrast , the humanities and the natural sciences share a sense of reality that transc@@ ends time and place ; hence their common interest in a fixed &quot; human nature . &quot;
this is tied to a way of thinking and a sense of knowing that is largely contemp@@ lative and sometimes even dis@@ empowering , as reality comes to seem to be whatever resi@@ sts our concer@@ ted efforts at change .
these two great academic cultures also prefer to study humanity without having to ming@@ le with fl@@ es@@ h-@@ and-@@ blood human beings .
thus , evolutionary psychologists in@@ fer what makes us who we are from the remains of our stone age ancestors ( including their dna ) , whereas human@@ ists focus on artifacts of a more recent and literate age .
in contrast , the social sciences ad@@ here to the max@@ im that the best way to study humans is to interact with them , typically by getting them to do and say things that they might otherwise not .
this profoundly simple idea , common to experiments and eth@@ no@@ graphi@@ es , inspired the trium@@ ph@@ s and disasters that pun@@ ctu@@ ate modern politics .
it requires an increasingly controversial assumption : all human beings - whatever their achievements , compe@@ ten@@ ces , status , or health - are equally significant members of society , whose strength ultimately lies in what they can do together .
the social sciences &apos; egal@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism runs counter to both the human@@ ist fix@@ ation on elite &quot; classic &quot; texts and the natural scientific tendency to gener@@ alize across species .
thus , social scientists made the everyday lives of ordinary people respe@@ ctable , while ref@@ using to privilege certain animals over certain - typically disabled or un@@ wanted - humans .
&quot; welfare &quot; occupi@@ es a pride of place in the social sciences that human@@ ists and natural scientists replace with &quot; survival &quot; and maybe even &quot; fortune . &quot;
to be sure , the check@@ ered history of welfare in the 20 th century put the future of the social sciences in doubt .
but a way forward can be found in t. h. hu@@ x@@ ley , darwin &apos;s fab@@ led public defen@@ der .
a late convert to evolution , he was a lifelong skeptic about the theory &apos;s political implications .
for hu@@ x@@ ley , civili@@ zed society rose above nature by its systematic resistance to natural selection .
in his words , the human condition is not about &quot; survival of the fit@@ test &quot; but &quot; the fitting of as many as can survive . &quot;
the future of the social sciences may lie in re@@ kind@@ ling this coalition of law and medicine and up@@ gra@@ ding the artificial in a world that may have come to over@@ value nature .
who needs to be eu president ?
whoever steps into europe ’ s new top job as president of the european council will set the mold .
if it is someone of worldwide ren@@ own , the pres@@ iden@@ cy will immediately be established as a post of global importance .
but if its first occu@@ p@@ ant is not a household name , the pres@@ iden@@ cy will be do@@ omed as just another of the european union ’ s confusing ple@@ th@@ ora of worthy senior positions that are neither valued nor understood outside brus@@ sels .
the key point here is that europe won ’ t be able to upgrade the job later .
if the pres@@ iden@@ cy goes to a politician who lac@@ ks fame and charis@@ ma , its place will forever be low down in the international pe@@ cking order .
of the half-@@ dozen candidates to become “ europe ’ s president , ” only tony blair needs no introduction anywhere .
nobody knows whether the current prime ministers of the eu ’ s 27 member countries will choose blair .
there is consider@@ able ling@@ ering ill will over his role in the invasion of iraq , and there is the inconvenient fact that he is from euro@@ -@@ skeptic britain , and that many on the left view him as a leader whose “ third way ” was a betra@@ yal of soci@@ alism .
but choosing a president for europe isn ’ t about blair the man , or about the political records of any of the others who would like the job .
it is about the job itself .
europe ’ s problem is that it lac@@ ks a clearly identifi@@ able leader . as a result , despite the eu ’ s many successes , it still speaks with too many voices .
this was among the problems that the eu ’ s controversial li@@ s@@ bon treaty was designed to fix .
it is now in the final stages of its long and difficult birth , and by the new year should be bringing new mechanisms to bear to stream@@ line european decision-making .
the je@@ wel in its cro@@ wn is to be the appointment for a 30-@@ month term of a full-time president of the european council , which groups the heads of eu member governments , along with a foreign policy chief who will be backed by an embryonic eu diplo@@ matic service .
now that more than two-thirds of ir@@ ish voters have rever@@ sed their country ’ s earlier opposition to the li@@ s@@ bon treaty – with only the c@@ ze@@ ch republic ’ s europ@@ ho@@ bic president , v@@ á@@ cla@@ v kl@@ aus , holding out against it – the focus is on who will fill these two jobs .
and that , in turn , has triggered a round of bitter political squ@@ ab@@ bling that threat@@ ens to ne@@ gate the entire idea of a much more powerful european voice on the global stage .
the three ben@@ elu@@ x countries , along with a few other smaller eu nations , are opposed to the new european president being from a large nation .
and there are also those who fear that a political hea@@ v@@ y@@ weight in the job might ec@@ lip@@ se the eu commission ’ s president , former portu@@ gu@@ ese prime minister jo@@ s@@ é manuel bar@@ ro@@ so , who has just been confir@@ med for a second five-@@ year term , and de@@ value the role of the foreign policy chief whose authority li@@ s@@ bon is due to beef up .
these are speci@@ ous arguments .
the eu ’ s external relations involve two different types of politics .
the first is the politics of world theatre , where a political figure of global stat@@ ure could do much to raise the eu ’ s profile and ensure that it has a major say in re-@@ or@@ dering the post-@@ crisis global economic ru@@ le@@ book .
the second is the politics of detail , where the new foreign policy chief ’ s role is to create a single eu stance on the wide range of issues about which european governments still have wil@@ dly different national positions .
europe has an international image problem that in part ste@@ ms from a complex institutional structure that non-@@ eu countries find ba@@ ff@@ ling .
it is over-@@ represented at g-@@ 20 world sum@@ mit@@ s , for instance , but the presence of four european national leaders , plus eu representatives like bar@@ ro@@ so , weak@@ ens rather than streng@@ th@@ ens its political weight .
the same is true of other global bodies like the world bank and the international mon@@ etary fund .
the result is that europe ’ s achievements in recent years – its expansion to create a single economic market of 500 million people and its creation of the euro as a currency that challenges the dollar – are not accompanied by a significantly greater global standing .
world leaders from barack obama to hu j@@ inta@@ o address themselves to berlin , paris , and london , rather than to brus@@ sels .
the result is that eu policy pro@@ pos@@ als that could do much to advance the economic and geo@@ political interests of europeans are not as influential as they could be .
the text of the li@@ s@@ bon treaty is studi@@ ously vague in its job description of the president ’ s role – an approach that prevented trouble for treaty ’ s fra@@ mers , but merely post@@ po@@ ned disagreement .
the real argument now taking place between europe ’ s national governments is about the authority that the eu ’ s president should have .
the risk is that europe ’ s squ@@ ab@@ bling politicians will op@@ t for a figu@@ re@@ head and miss this golden opportunity to create a global leader .
who next at the ec@@ b helm ?
til@@ burg , the netherlands – two years ago , the leaders of the world ’ s central banks were considered heroes for their efforts in preventing financial crisis from turning into great depression ii .
today , however , central banks are being shar@@ ply criticized , and their independence is coming under severe pressure in many countries , particularly in the euro@@ zone , as mari@@ o dra@@ gh@@ i , the head of the bank of italy , recently pointed out .
the type of person at the helm of any central bank is always important – but now more than ever , because financial crises always threaten central banks ’ independence .
in the united states , the federal reserve seems to have support only of the obama administration , hardly something of which to be proud .
congress has dis@@ para@@ ged the fed ’ s handling of the crisis , and representative ron paul of texas , who believes that the fed ’ s very existence is un@@ constitu@@ tional , will take over one of the key con@@ gressi@@ onal over@@ sight commit@@ te@@ es in january .
more than half of all americans want politicians to have more say over mon@@ etary policy – a scary prospect in view of the historical record .
given the likelihood of a long period of sub-@@ p@@ ar economic growth , increasing pressure on public finan@@ ces in the euro@@ zone , and the ongoing debate on the future of the euro , the european central bank has become , more than ever before , the last line of defense for europe ’ s common currency .
a firm ec@@ b president , un@@ willing to yield to political pressure , is needed .
during the financial crisis , the ec@@ b has had an out@@ standing president in the person of jean-@@ c@@ lau@@ de tri@@ ch@@ et .
but his non-@@ renewable term will end in october 2011 , and european leaders are not waiting until the last moment to ap@@ point his success@@ or .
indeed , posi@@ tioning and bar@@ gaining among the euro ’ s member countries has already started .
first and foremost , the next ec@@ b president should exc@@ el on mon@@ etary matters .
true , the current financial crisis has brought bank super@@ vision to the fore .
but mon@@ etary policy , not bank super@@ vision , is the rais@@ on d ’ ê@@ tr@@ e of central banks , whereas the banks can be well hand@@ led by the newly established european systemic risk board ( es@@ rb ) , which will be responsible for macro@@ -@@ p@@ ru@@ den@@ tial super@@ vision in europe from january 1 , 2011 .
furthermore , and contrary to common belief , the ec@@ b president need not be very diplo@@ matic , but should be able to unite all members of the ec@@ b ’ s gover@@ ning council .
as political pressure on central banks , including the ec@@ b , increases , its president must not hes@@ it@@ ate to critici@@ ze european politicians and , if necessary , publicly name and shame them .
the ec@@ b ’ s independence is its most valuable asset – indeed , it is in@@ dispen@@ sible .
a good central banker must be able to say no to politicians .
this does not mean the ec@@ b president should pick fights whenever possible .
on the contrary , he should be able to build support for the ec@@ b ’ s independence .
but he should follow the max@@ im about politicians set down by the ec@@ b ’ s first president , wi@@ m du@@ is@@ en@@ berg : “ i can hear them , but i do not listen . ”
the president should also count on support from a majority of europeans .
unfortunately , country of origin is highly important in this respect .
given the fact that the current ec@@ b vi@@ ce-@@ president is from southern europe ( portugal ) , the next head of the ec@@ b must come from northern europe .
only someone from germany , the netherlands , or a sc@@ andin@@ avian euro country like finland can count on support from ger@@ mans , which is crucial .
there is certainly someone to be found in the euro@@ zone who poss@@ esses all these qualities .
dra@@ gh@@ i is one . others include kl@@ aus re@@ gling , head of the european financial stability facility ( ef@@ sf ) , ax@@ el we@@ ber , president of the bundes@@ bank , and j@@ ür@@ gen stark , a current member of the ec@@ b ’ s executive board .
dra@@ gh@@ i ’ s italian pas@@ sport and his past service at goldman sachs do not help him much .
re@@ gling has a lot of experience , but none in central banking and mon@@ etary policy .
anyone who wants stark will need a good team of lawyers to figure out how to convert his current , non-@@ renewable appointment on the executive board into an appointment as president without viol@@ ating the ec@@ b ’ s rules .
given some of we@@ ber ’ s statements over 2010 , he could be accused of being much too un@@ diplo@@ matic .
n@@ out well@@ ink , currently the head of the dutch central bank , is a wild@@ card candidate , as is er@@ k@@ ki li@@ i@@ kan@@ en of the finish central bank .
both are suitable for the post .
the final decision , of course , re@@ sts with european heads of state and government .
who owns boli@@ via ?
a few months ago , ev@@ o mor@@ ales became boli@@ via ‘ s first democra@@ tically elected indigenous head of state .
indigenous groups constit@@ ute 62 % of boli@@ via ’ s population , and those with mixed blood another 30 % , but for 500 years boli@@ vi@@ ans had been ruled by coloni@@ al powers and their descen@@ dan@@ ts .
well into the twen@@ tieth century , indigenous groups were effectively depri@@ ved of a vote and a voice .
ay@@ mar@@ a and qu@@ ech@@ u@@ a , their languages , were not even recognized for conducting public business .
so mor@@ ales ’ election was historic , and the excitement in boli@@ via is pal@@ pable .
but mor@@ ales ’ nation@@ alization of boli@@ via ’ s oil and gas fields sent shock waves through the international community .
during his campaign , mor@@ ales made clear his intention to increase state control over national gas and oil .
but he had made it equally clear that he did not intend to ex@@ propri@@ ate the property of energy firms – he wanted foreign investors to stay .
( nation@@ alization does not , of course , necessarily mean ex@@ propri@@ ation without appropriate compen@@ sation . )
perhaps surprising for modern politicians , mor@@ ales took his words seriously .
genuinely concerned about raising the incomes of his desperately poor people , he recognized that boli@@ via needs foreig@@ ners ’ expertise to achieve growth , and that this ent@@ a@@ ils paying fairly for their services .
but are foreign owners getting more than a fair rate of return ?
mor@@ ales ’ actions are widely supported by boli@@ vi@@ ans , who see the so-called privati@@ zations ( or “ capit@@ alizations ” ) under former president gon@@ z@@ alo “ gon@@ i ” san@@ che@@ z de lo@@ z@@ ada as a ri@@ p-@@ off : boli@@ via received only 18 % of the proce@@ eds !
boli@@ vi@@ ans wonder why investments of some $ 3 billion should enti@@ tle foreign investors to 82 % of the country ’ s vast gas reserves , now estimated to be worth $ 250 billion .
while there has not yet been full dis@@ closure of returns , or an au@@ dit of the true value of investments , it appears that investors would , at the old terms , have rec@@ ou@@ ped all their money within just four years .
boli@@ vi@@ ans also ask why foreig@@ ners re@@ ap all the benefits of today ’ s high prices for oil and gas ?
it costs no more to extract oil or gas today than it did when prices were one-third of their current level .
yet , the foreign oil companies get 82 % of the increase – in the case of oil , this would amount to a wind@@ fall for them of $ 32 a barrel or more .
on may 2 , mor@@ ales simply rever@@ sed the percent@@ ages , pen@@ ding rene@@ goti@@ ation of the contracts : the companies operating in the two largest fields would get 18 % of the production for themselves .
as part of this new deal , boli@@ via should also get a larger share when prices increase .
( boli@@ via may , of course , not want to bear the risk of a fall in the price , so it may strike a deal to transfer some of the down@@ side risk to foreign companies , giving them in exchange more of the upside potential . )
to most boli@@ vi@@ ans , what is at stake is a matter of fairness : should foreign oil and gas companies get a fair return on their capital , or a super@@ normal return ?
should boli@@ via be paid a fair value for its resources ?
and should boli@@ via , or foreign companies , re@@ ap most of the wind@@ fall gains from increases in energy prices ?
moreover , many deals were apparently done in secret by previous governments – and apparently without the approval of congress .
indeed , because boli@@ via ’ s constitution requires the approval of congress for such sales , it isn ’ t clear that mor@@ ales is nation@@ alizing anything : the assets were never properly sold .
when a country is rob@@ bed of a national art treasure , we don ’ t call its return “ re-@@ nation@@ alization , ” because it belon@@ ged to the country all along .
as with many privati@@ zations elsewhere , there are questions as to whether the foreign investors have kept their side of the bar@@ gain .
boli@@ via contributed to these joint enter@@ pris@@ es not only with resources , but also with previous investments .
the foreign companies ’ contribution was supposed to be further investment .
but did they fully live up to their commit@@ ments ?
are accounting gi@@ mmi@@ cks being used to over@@ state the true value of foreign capital contributions ?
boli@@ via ’ s government has , so far , simply raised questions , and set in motion a process for as@@ cer@@ taining the answer .
the problem in boli@@ via is a lack of transparency , both when contracts are signed and afterwards .
without transparency , it is easy for citizens to feel that they are being cheated – and they often are .
when foreign companies get a deal that is too good to be true , there is often something under@@ handed going on .
around the world , oil and gas companies have themselves to blame : too often , they have resi@@ sted calls for greater transparency .
in the future , companies and countries should agree on a simple principle : there should be , to parap@@ hr@@ ase president woo@@ dro@@ w wilson ’ s memorable words , “ open contracts , open@@ ly and transpar@@ ently arrived at . ”
if the boli@@ vi@@ ans do not get fair value for their country ’ s natural wealth , their pro@@ spe@@ cts are b@@ leak .
even if they do , they will need assistance , not only to extract their resources , but also to improve the health and education of all boli@@ vi@@ ans – to ensure long-term economic growth and social welfare .
for now , the world should celebrate the fact that boli@@ via has a democra@@ tically elected leader attemp@@ ting to represent the interests of the poor people of his country .
it is a historic moment .
who pays for bird flu ?
fifty years ago , american chicken farmers found that by keeping their birds in she@@ ds they could produce chickens for the table more cheap@@ ly and with less work than by traditional far@@ my@@ ard methods .
the new method spread : chickens disappeared from fields into long , window@@ less she@@ ds .
factory farming was born .
it isn ’ t called “ factory farming ” merely because those she@@ ds look like factories .
everything about the production method is ge@@ ared towards turning live animals into machines for conver@@ ting grain into meat or eggs at the lowest possible cost .
walk into such a shed – if the producer will let you – and you will find up to 30,000 chickens .
the national chicken council , the trade association for the us chicken industry , recommen@@ ds a sto@@ cking density of 85 square inches per bird – less than a standard sheet of typing paper .
when the chickens approach market weight , they cover the floor completely .
no chicken can move without having to push through other birds .
in the egg industry , hens can barely move at all , because they are cra@@ mmed into wire c@@ ages , which makes it possible to stack them in tiers , one above the other .
environment@@ alists point out that this production method is unsustainable .
for a start , it reli@@ es on the use of fossil fuel energy to light and venti@@ late the she@@ ds , and to transport the grain eaten by the chickens .
when this grain , which humans could eat directly , is fed to chickens , they use some of it to create bones and feathers and other body parts that we cannot eat .
so we get less food back than we put into the birds – and less protein , too – while dis@@ posing of the concentrated chicken manure causes serious pollution to rivers and ground water .
anim@@ al-@@ welfare advoc@@ ates protest that crow@@ ding the chickens keeps them from forming a natural flock , causes them stress , and , in the case of laying hens , prevents them from even stre@@ tching their wings .
the air in the she@@ ds is high in am@@ mon@@ ia from bird fe@@ ces , which are usually allowed to pile up for months – and in some cases for a year or more – before being cleaned out .
medical experts warn that because the birds are routinely fed antibiotics to keep them growing in such crowded , fil@@ thy , and stress@@ ful conditions , antibio@@ tic@@ -@@ resistant bacteria could cause a publi@@ c-@@ health threat .
yet , despite these well-@@ founded cri@@ tic@@ is@@ ms , over the last 20 years factory farming – not only of chickens , but also of pigs , ve@@ al cal@@ ves , da@@ ir@@ y cows , and , in outdoor feed@@ lots , cattle – has spread rapidly in developing countries , especially in asia .
now we are discovering that the consequences may be far more deadly than we ever imagined .
as university of ot@@ tawa vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ist ear@@ l brown put it after a canadian outbreak of avian influenza , “ high-@@ intensity chicken re@@ aring is a perfect environment for generating virul@@ ent avian flu viruses . ”
other experts agree .
in october 2005 , a united nations task force identified as one of the root causes of the bird flu epidemic , “ farming methods which crowd huge numbers of animals into small spaces . ”
suppor@@ ters of factory farming often point out that bird flu can be spread by free-@@ range flo@@ cks , or by wild du@@ cks and other migr@@ ating birds , who may join the free-@@ range birds to feed with them or drop their fe@@ ces while flying overhead .
but , as brown has pointed out , viruses found in wild birds are generally not very dangerous .
on the contrary , it is only when these viruses enter a high-@@ density po@@ ul@@ try operation that they mu@@ tate into something far more virul@@ ent .
by contrast , birds that are re@@ ared by traditional methods are likely to have greater resistance to disease than the stressed , genetically similar birds kept in intensive con@@ fin@@ ement systems .
moreover , factory farms are not biologically secure . they are frequently in@@ fest@@ ed with mice , rats , and other animals that can bring in diseases .
so far , a relatively small number of human beings have died from the current strain of avian influenza , and it appears that they have all been in contact with infected birds .
but if the virus mu@@ tates into a form that is trans@@ mis@@ sible between humans , the number of deaths could run into the hundreds of millions .
governments are , rightly , taking action to prepare for this threat .
recently , the us senate approved spending $ 8 billion to stock@@ pile vaccines and other drugs to help prevent a possible bird flu epidemic .
other governments have already spent tens of millions on vaccines and other pre@@ ven@@ tive measures .
like most subsidies , it is bad economics .
factory farming spread because it seemed to be cheaper than more traditional methods .
in fact , it was cheaper only because it passed some of its costs on to others – for example , to people who lived downstream or down@@ wind from the factory farms , and could no longer enjoy clean water and air .
now we see that these were only a small part of the total costs .
factory farming is passing far bigger costs – and risks – on to all of us .
in economic terms , these costs should be “ intern@@ alized ” by the factory farmers rather than being shifted onto the rest of us .
that won ’ t be easy to do , but we could make a start by im@@ posing a tax on fac@@ tor@@ y-@@ farm products until enough revenue is raised to pay for the pre@@ cau@@ tions that governments now have to take against avian influenza .
then we might finally see that chicken from the factory farm really isn ’ t so cheap after all .
the us still runs the world
washington , dc – reports of the death of american power have often been greatly exagger@@ ated .
in the 1950s the soviet union was thought to have sur@@ passed the united states ; today , the soviet union no longer exists .
in the 1980s , japan was widely regarded as on the verge of over@@ taking the us ; today , after more than two decades of japanese stag@@ nation , no one would take this scenario seriously .
and in the 1990s , mon@@ etary union was considered likely to pro@@ pel europe to greater global promin@@ ence ; today , the european economy is frequently in the world ’ s headlines , but not in a good way .
now it is china ’ s turn .
until recently , china , in many people ’ s view , was pois@@ ed to assume global leadership , if it hadn ’ t done so already .
today , doub@@ ts about the chinese economy ’ s long-term pro@@ spe@@ cts are rat@@ tling stock markets worldwide ( including in the us ) .
china matters , and its economic policy , including how the exchange rate is managed , must be taken seriously .
but china does not run the world , and it is unlikely to do so anytime soon .
the potential for global leadership still re@@ sts , believe it or not , with the us .
the best case for taking china seriously as a world power is made in ar@@ v@@ ind su@@ bra@@ manian ’ s best-@@ selling book ec@@ lip@@ se : living in the shadow of china ’ s economic dominance , published in 2011 .
( the author , now chief economic advis@@ er at india ’ s finance ministry , and i were colleagues and sometimes co-@@ authors at the international mon@@ etary fund and the peter@@ son institute for international economics . )
one hopes that the indian government will he@@ ed su@@ bra@@ manian ’ s account of how china grew through exports of manufactured goods and associated productivity improvements .
china also became integrated into global supply chains – producing things for companies elsewhere – on a previously unimaginable scale , and chinese managers learned how to make better products .
but other parts of china ’ s experience have served it less well over time .
china ran a very large curr@@ ent-@@ account surplus during the early 200@@ 0s and accum@@ ulated a vast stock of foreign reserves – including at least several trillion dollars ’ worth of us treas@@ ury debt .
although this looks impressive on paper , reserves of this magnitude are essentially useless .
if china were to sell its us assets , the dollar would wea@@ ken , and us companies would find it easier to export and to compete against impor@@ ts .
but americans ’ anxiety about being over@@ taken is not new .
there was great angst in the late 1980s when a japanese company bought new york city ’ s rockefeller center .
in retro@@ spect , that was one of the great non-@@ events of the twen@@ tieth century .
similarly , americans will most likely look back on china ’ s accumulation of us government debt and simply shr@@ u@@ g .
the bigger issue is china ’ s ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate policy .
for a long time , china prevented the ren@@ min@@ bi from becoming over@@ valued – and this was good policy , as su@@ bra@@ manian ’ s research con@@ firms .
but in the early 200@@ 0s , china went too far .
for reasons that are still deb@@ ated , the ren@@ min@@ bi became massively under@@ valued ; exports were much higher than impor@@ ts , and the curr@@ ent-@@ account surplus reached more than 10 % of gdp .
instead of letting the ren@@ min@@ bi appreciate and gradually reducing their reli@@ ance on export markets , the chinese authorities preferred to accumulate foreign reserves ( us treas@@ ury debt ) .
now china has to figure out a way to sustain growth when demand in the rest of the world is slu@@ g@@ g@@ ish .
a return to a substan@@ tially under@@ valued exchange rate would almost certainly provo@@ ke an international response , including from the us congress .
but switching suddenly to domestic@@ -@@ led growth is not easy .
china will not collapse ( it is not the soviet union ) , and japan@@ es@@ e-@@ style stag@@ nation is also unlikely .
but china is aging fast – and could become old before it becomes rich .
every decade , important people predict the end of american power .
and there are reasons to be concerned – particularly when some us politicians refuse to acknowledge the nature of america ’ s global role .
for example , the us built the world ’ s trading and mon@@ etary system 70 years ago , but now republicans in congress refuse to support change at the imf – including sensible reforms that almost all other countries favor .
still , it is the us that is currently leading the push for fre@@ er trade across the pacific and a substantial reduction in barriers to trade with europe .
if america gets the rules right – favor@@ ing ordinary citizens , rather than foot@@ loose corporations – its trade initi@@ atives will make a major contribution to global growth and its own prosperity .
likewise , in terms of mon@@ etary policy , the major issue for the world over the next year is when and how much the federal reserve will raise interest rates .
as us mon@@ etary officials gather for their annual jackson hole con@@ cla@@ ve , they will consider myri@@ ad relevant dimensions of the global economy .
but the policy@@ -@@ setting federal open market committee will move interest rates based almost entirely on its collective read of us economic circumstances .
once again , the rest of the world will react to what the us does .
who &apos;s afraid of al jazeera ?
no one is in@@ different to al jazeera , the qat@@ ari@@ -based arab satellite television station .
you can practically see the blood of us officials boil when they discuss it .
to be sure , in the context of the dream of all arab@@ s being united and independent of foreign control , al jazeera is un@@ deni@@ ably partial to arab aspirations . but that does not make its news reporting un@@ tru@@ thful .
in fact , al jazeera , which us secretary of state co@@ lin po@@ well calls &quot; horrible &quot; and &quot; s@@ lan@@ ted , &quot; is a pi@@ vot@@ al vehicle for reform and change , which genuinely democratic arab activists and the international community alike have been calling for .
so incen@@ sed has america been , however , that it created its own arabic language mou@@ th@@ piece in the form of satellite station al hur@@ ra .
yet al hur@@ ra is forbi@@ dden from broadcasting within the us , because it is state controlled .
arab@@ s don &apos;t trust it , either .
it demonstrated its lap@@ dog status by never broadcasting images of prisoners being abused inside bag@@ h@@ dad &apos;s not@@ ori@@ ous abu ghraib prison .
in this respect , at least , al hur@@ ra fits perfectly within the t@@ ame tradition of arab state broad@@ ca@@ sters .
the bbc , which briefly ran its own arabic language news station in the mid-@@ 1990 &apos;s - before closing it down because its saudi funders were unhappy with its reporting - recently announced that it will re-@@ launch an arabic language news satellite station .
but instead of bas@@ hing or seeking to under@@ mine al jazeera , politicians should encourage this ba@@ stion of free expression , recognizing that arab@@ s will need to end@@ ure a messy process on the way to democracy .
along that tor@@ tu@@ ous route , the world &apos;s major powers are bound to be offen@@ ded , probably quite regularly .
television in the arab world has for years been the mou@@ th@@ piece used by rul@@ ing presidents , kings , and emi@@ rs to propag@@ ate their official opinions and nothing else .
elite military units usually protect radio and television stations , because they have often been the first targets in military cou@@ ps .
given this history , and the storm of calls for reform in the arab world , it is a tragic irony that america and the west have paid so little attention to the terrestrial arab monopoly television channels .
indeed , us criticism of al jazeera sounds more like special ple@@ ading because of america &apos;s ine@@ pt bu@@ m@@ bling in iraq than a genuine desire for free , open , and critical arab media .
if democracy means giving people a free choice , then there is no doubt that the choice of most arab@@ s is for a television broad@@ ca@@ ster that reflects their aspirations .
in this sense , al jazeera is clearly biased , because it is run by arab patri@@ ots and reflects arab senti@@ ment .
but this is no more a crime than the fact that america &apos;s media reflects american aspirations , and in times of war beha@@ ves like a che@@ er@@ leader for us forces .
the key issue here is whether al jazeera , as well as american tv stations , are tru@@ thful in what they say .
al jazeera is certainly professional .
its leading journalists are western@@ -@@ trained , many having worked for years at the bbc .
in fact , al jazeera was founded only after the bbc closed its arabic language station under saudi pressure .
al jazeera &apos;s motto , &quot; opinion and op@@ posing opinion , &quot; has gal@@ vani@@ zed arab viewers , because clas@@ hing opinions are rarely heard on terrestrial arab television stations .
of course , when covering the israeli occupation of palestine and the us-@@ led war on iraq , al jazeera has not been objective .
how could it be ?
but it did not make up facts ; it merely reflected majority arab opinion .
on such fundamental issues of arab consensus , it is simply il@@ logical to expect an arab broad@@ ca@@ ster to be ev@@ en-@@ handed .
moreover , al jazeera has not been dumb to compla@@ ints about it .
according to the bbc , the code defines with absolute clarity and transparency how al-@@ jazeera journalists are to behave , and sets clear di@@ visions between news , analysis , and commentary .
as for al jazeera &apos;s journ@@ alistic performance , it is past time that the station be jud@@ ged by respected professional journalists , not by us or other officials with a policy ax@@ e to gr@@ ind .
a major university department of journalism working with arab media cri@@ tics , for example , could provide a much more honest analysis of the station &apos;s work .
if american , british , and other western officials are serious about reform in the arab world , they must support re@@ form@@ -@@ minded arab individuals and organizations , even if those organizations make them uncomfortable at times .
if that becomes the west &apos;s standard , al jazeera will rightly be seen as part of the solution , not part of the problem .
who ’ s afraid of climate change ?
copenhagen – imagine that over the next 70 or 80 years , a giant port city – say , tokyo – found itself eng@@ ul@@ fed by sea levels rising as much as 15 feet or more .
millions of inhabit@@ ants would be imper@@ iled , along with trilli@@ ons of dollars worth of infrastructure .
this awful prospect is exactly the sort of thing glob@@ al-@@ warming evange@@ lists like al gore have in mind when they warn that we must take “ large-scale , pre@@ ven@@ tive measures to protect human civilization as we know it . ”
the rhetoric may sound extreme , but with so much hanging in the balance , surely it ’ s justi@@ fied .
without a vast , highly coordinated global effort , how could we possibly cope with se@@ a-@@ level rises on that order of magnitude ?
well , we already have . in fact , we ’ re doing it right now .
since 19@@ 30 , exc@@ essive ground@@ water with@@ dra@@ wal has caused tokyo to sub@@ side by as much as 15 feet , with some of the lowest parts of the downtown area dropping almost a foot per year in some years .
similar subsi@@ dence has occurred over the past century in a wide range of cities , including ti@@ an@@ j@@ in , shanghai , o@@ sa@@ ka , bang@@ k@@ ok , and ja@@ kar@@ ta .
in each case , the city has managed to protect itself from such large se@@ a-@@ level rises and thrive .
the point isn ’ t that we can or should ignore global warming .
the point is that we should be war@@ y of hyperbolic predictions .
more often than not , what sound like horrific changes in climate and geography actually turn out to be manage@@ able – and in some cases even benign .
consider , for example , the findings of climate scientists robert j. nich@@ oll@@ s , richard s.@@ j. to@@ l , and a@@ than@@ asi@@ os t. v@@ af@@ ei@@ dis .
in research funded by the european union , they studied what the global economic impact would be if global warming were to result in a collapse of the entire west antarctic ice sheet .
an event of this magnitude would likely cause the oceans to rise by perhaps 20 feet over the next hundred years – precisely the sort of thing that environmental activists have in mind when they warn about potential end-@@ of-the-@@ world cal@@ am@@ ities .
but would it really be all that cal@@ amit@@ ous ?
not according to nich@@ oll@@ s , to@@ l , and v@@ af@@ ei@@ dis .
here are the facts .
a 20-@@ foot rise in sea levels ( which , not incidentally , is about ten times more than the united nations climate panel ’ s wor@@ st-@@ case expectations ) would in@@ un@@ date about 16@@ ,000 square miles of coast@@ line , where more than 400 million people currently live .
that ’ s a lot of people , to be sure , but hardly all of mankind .
and most of those who do live in the flood areas would never even get their feet wet .
that ’ s because the vast majority of those 400 million people resi@@ de within cities , where they could be protected relatively easily , as in tokyo .
as a result , only about 15 million people would have to be reloc@@ ated .
and that is over the course of a century .
in all , according to nich@@ oll@@ s , to@@ l , and v@@ af@@ ei@@ dis , the total cost of managing this “ catastrophe ” – if politicians do not di@@ ther and pursue smart , coordinated policies – would be about $ 600 billion a year , or less than 1 % of global gdp .
this figure may seem surprisingly low , but that is only because so many of us have accepted the widespread view that we lack the capacity to adapt to large rises in sea levels .
not only do we have this capacity , but we have demonstrated it many times in the past .
like it or not , global warming is real , it is man-made , and we need to do something about it .
but we are not facing the end of the world .
climate science is a subtle and fi@@ en@@ dis@@ h@@ ly con@@ volu@@ ted discipline that rarely yields un@@ ambiguous fore@@ ca@@ sts or straightforward prescri@@ ptions .
and after 20 years of much talk but precious little action on global warming , a certain amount of frustration is to be expected .
there is an understandable desire to want to cut through the ver@@ bi@@ age and shake people by the shoulders .
unfortunately , trying to scare the so@@ cks off of people doesn ’ t help matters .
yes , a startling statistic , combined with some hyperbolic pro@@ se , will make us sit up and pay attention .
but we quickly become des@@ en@@ si@@ tized , requ@@ ir@@ ing ever more outrageous scenarios to move us .
as the scare stories become more in@@ fl@@ ated , so , too , does the likelihood that they will be exposed for the exagger@@ ations that they are – and the public will end up tun@@ ing the whole thing out .
this may explain recent poll@@ ing data showing that public concern about global warming has declined precipit@@ ously in the last three years .
in the united states , for example , the pe@@ w institute reported that the number of americans who regard global warming as a very serious problem had declined from 44 % in april 2008 to only 35 % last october .
more recently , a bbc study found that only 26 % of bri@@ tons believe that man-made “ climate change is happening , ” down from 41 % in november 2009 .
and in germany , der spiegel magazine reported survey results showing that only 42 % fe@@ ared global warming , compared with 62 % in 2006 .
fear may be a great motiv@@ ator in the short term , but it is a terrible basis for making smart decisions about a complicated problem that demands our full intelligence for a long period .
who ’ s afraid of europe ’ s human-@@ rights court ?
so@@ fi@@ a – at a time when the ongoing european debt crisis is frac@@ turing public faith in the continent ’ s political and economic institutions , one would expect europe ’ s leaders to streng@@ then as many uni@@ fying symbols as they can .
instead , they have allowed one of the jewel@@ s of post-@@ world war ii european integration – the european court of human rights ( ech@@ r ) – to come under threat as well .
unlike the brus@@ sel@@ s-@@ based european union , long bele@@ agu@@ ered by its democratic deficit , the str@@ as@@ bour@@ g-@@ based ech@@ r is , if anything , too well loved .
in 2011 , more than 60,000 people sought its help – far more than can expect a reas@@ oned decision .
( by contrast , the united states supreme court receives roughly 10,000 pe@@ ti@@ tions a year . )
to save the ech@@ r from this crus@@ hing burden , some member states have proposed changes that could wea@@ ken it , even if un@@ inten@@ tionally .
those of us who passionately believe in the court and its achievements must speak out now to persuade the protag@@ onists of mis@@ guided reforms to reverse course .
instead , the ech@@ r ’ s 47 member states – with 800 million people – need to shoulder more responsibility to make the existing system work .
launched in the after@@ math of the holocaust , the ech@@ r has become a potent symbol of europe ’ s commitment to government by law , not force , by v@@ indic@@ ating the rights to life , humane treatment , free expression , and access to a lawyer .
for example , the court ruled that the in@@ famous “ five techniques ” – an early form of “ enhanced interro@@ gation ” employed by the british in northern ireland in the 1970 ’ s – constitu@@ ted in@@ human treatment , and con@@ dem@@ ned racial se@@ gre@@ gation of ro@@ ma children in c@@ ze@@ ch schools .
because of their quality , the ech@@ r ’ s opinions have a profound impact beyond europe .
when str@@ as@@ bour@@ g speaks , the world ’ s judges and lawyers listen .
even the us supreme court c@@ ited its reasoning when striking down anti-@@ homosexu@@ ality laws in texas in 2003 .
nonetheless , the ech@@ r ’ s future is in serious je@@ opar@@ dy .
as the only im@@ partial check on abuse of power in some countries , the court is sw@@ am@@ ped with compla@@ ints – more than 60 % come from russia , turkey , italy , roman@@ ia , and ukra@@ ine .
some argue that the answer to the flood of cases is to limit the court ’ s powers .
but that approach seems un@@ wise .
british prime minister david cameron , for example , has told the parli@@ am@@ entary assembly of the council of europe that national decisions “ should be treated with respect ” – code for less ju@@ di@@ cial over@@ sight .
similarly , other senior officials have called for new restri@@ ctions on cases that the ech@@ r may hear , including de@@ fer@@ ral to those national courts which have supposedly taken full account of european human-@@ rights law .
in the united kingdom , the court ’ s 2005 rul@@ ing against a blan@@ ket with@@ dra@@ wal of voting rights for prisoners , on the grounds that dis@@ en@@ franch@@ is@@ ement can be dis@@ proportion@@ ate to the offen@@ se , provo@@ ked official wr@@ ath .
and , earlier this year , the cameron government was incen@@ sed by a decision that bar@@ red the de@@ por@@ tation of an islamic pre@@ a@@ cher to jordan on terrorism charges , because his trial there might be tain@@ ted by evidence obtained under torture .
even under new rules , such cases might still come before the court , because they raise fundamental questions that require interpretation of the european convention .
indeed , there is no evidence that proposed convention am@@ end@@ ments aimed at limit@@ ing the court ’ s authority would reduce its cas@@ elo@@ ad .
but they send a dangerous message that some governments should be exem@@ pt from standards that apply to everyone else .
reducing the flow of compla@@ ints depends , above all , on governments doing more to ent@@ ren@@ ch the rule of law at home – even if they must be pushed and sh@@ amed into it .
author@@ it@@ ative and bin@@ ding court judgments , many of which require governments to compen@@ sa@@ te victims , are among the most effective tools for construc@@ tive pressure – and may well provide better value in promoting the rule of law than the millions of euros invested annu@@ ally in technical assistance and training in the er@@ ring states .
in addition , leg@@ isla@@ tive reforms en@@ acted in 2010 must be given time and resources to work .
all agree that the ech@@ r is making progress in reducing the back@@ log of pen@@ ding applications .
the court can increase the number of “ pilot judgments ” concern@@ ing systemic harm , prescribe more specific measures of red@@ ress , and sti@@ ffen mon@@ etary awards where repeated viol@@ ations reflect persistent failure to he@@ ed prior judgments .
the committee of ministers , which over@@ sees imple@@ mentation , should issue public san@@ ctions where appropriate .
and states must take more seriously their obli@@ ga@@ tions to reme@@ dy viol@@ ations before cases reach str@@ as@@ bour@@ g .
to be sure , no court gets every decision right , or ple@@ ases all parties .
but even democratic governments sometimes make big mistakes .
some political leaders seem too pre@@ occupied with their own dis@@ agre@@ ements with individual decisions to see the larger interest in preserving a european institution that commands widespread admi@@ ration .
the next two months will be telling .
the uk , which currently holds the rotating council of europe chair , has announced that it will seek adoption by april of a ministeri@@ al declar@@ ation on court reform .
though a dra@@ ft is now circul@@ ating in national capit@@ als , the role of ci@@ vil@@ -@@ society groups remains unclear .
it is crucial that those who have the greatest stake in the ech@@ r – europe ’ s people – participate meaning@@ fully in these discussions .
in a time of financial constra@@ int , the court ’ s judges issue more than 1,000 rul@@ ings annu@@ ally , many of great importance , for less than the cost of the eu ’ s publi@@ cations budget .
a half-@@ century after its birth , the ech@@ r provides an inv@@ alu@@ able public good , not just for europeans , but for all people concerned with human rights anywhere .
in the coming weeks , europe ’ s governments will be measured by their commitment to the preservation of this vital global resource .
who ’ s dependent now ?
if the late great argent@@ ine economist rau@@ l pre@@ bisch were alive today , he no doubt would wonder whether the world had turned upside down .
his hugely influential “ dependen@@ cy ” theory argued that if poor countries reli@@ ed too much on commodity exports , they would never achieve the industrial depth needed to sustain rapid growth .
instead , they would become mi@@ red in a cycle of declining global commodity prices and ever-@@ d@@ wind@@ ling income shares .
pre@@ bisch ’ s preferred policy response , prote@@ c@@ tion@@ ism , proved disa@@ strous for the many latin american and african countries that he@@ eded him .
but the fact is that for many years , pre@@ bisch seemed to have made the right call on long-term commodity price trends .
rel@@ ent@@ less efficiency gains in agriculture and resource extra@@ ction pushed down prices for commodities , especially during the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s .
with few exceptions , countries that focused on commodity exports performed dis@@ m@@ ally , whereas many resour@@ ce-@@ poor asian countries ra@@ ced ahead .
today , however , with asia ’ s giants , india and china , joining the global economy , prices for oil , gold , wheat , and virtually every other commodity are explo@@ ding .
while there will always be cycles – oil prices , for example , will probably fall before they start rising again – the long-@@ run trend for many commodities will clearly remain upward for some time to come .
what many trade negoti@@ ators and other policymakers do not seem to have recognized yet , though pre@@ bisch would have realized it instantly , is that this dramatic turn of events carries huge implications for the global balance of power .
indeed , perhaps no other aspect of economic globalization will pose greater challenges to world leaders over the coming decades .
are today ’ s rich countries prepared for an era of co-@@ dependen@@ cy , in which they are just as desperate for commodities as developing countries are for industrial impor@@ ts and technology ?
are they prepared for the inevitable flow of power and influence to commodity producers as they become much weal@@ thier ?
how will the world ’ s two super@@ powers , china and the united states , come to terms with the fact that important commodi@@ ty-@@ expor@@ ting regions from africa to the middle east to central asia are li@@ ttered with ill-@@ formed nation states ?
some self-@@ an@@ o@@ in@@ ted se@@ ers portra@@ y the problem as being one of finite natural resources , with the world running out of critical commodities at an alarming rate .
nowadays , there are many ad@@ her@@ ents of the “ hub@@ bert ’ s peak ” theory of oil production , which holds that we have reached the upper limits of output capacity , the wells are running dry , and it is all down@@ hill from here .
however , as leading oil historian dan y@@ er@@ gin points out , prophe@@ ts of do@@ om have declared that the world is running out of oil at least four times already .
each time , radical improvements in technology made the threat evaporate .
in the late 1800 ’ s , oil extra@@ ction involved dre@@ d@@ ging with a mu@@ le .
today , no one thinks anything of drilling 3,000 meters beneath the ocean floor .
there have been similar improvements across the board in metals mining and agriculture .
no , the world is not about to run out of commodities .
instead , what is happening is that the integration of 2.5 billion people ( china and india alone ) into the global economy is producing a demand shift that is likely to put far more upward pressure on commodity prices than any technology gains are likely to off@@ set .
so , for at least the next 50 to 75 years , and perhaps until humans start mining on mars sometime in the coming centuries , prices for many natural resources are headed up .
will the re@@ balancing of global economic power that results from this dest@@ abili@@ ze world politics ?
world war i , of course , was partly set off by germany ’ s concern that the other coloni@@ al powers had locked up too large a share of world oil and commodity supplies .
similarly , in world war ii , japan fe@@ ared for the stability of its foreign supplies of oil and other natural resources .
will similar ten@@ sions arise between resour@@ ce-@@ challenged china ( where even water scarcity is a problem ) and the west ?
fortunately , this does not seem likely for the moment , especially given the chinese leadership ’ s so@@ ber and pragmatic approach to its resource problems .
the chinese are looking to regions like africa , hoping to find stable trading partners .
they do not share the political evange@@ li@@ sm of the americans , who don ’ t just want to trade with commodity expor@@ ters , but to convert them as well .
then there are those american leaders who still speak of making the us self-@@ sufficient in energy supplies .
but this is basically a joke : self-@@ indul@@ gent , maybe , but self-@@ sufficient , never .
much of the arab world understand@@ ably views the invasion of iraq as the cor@@ ner@@ stone of the real us strategy for se@@ cur@@ ing stable energy supplies .
if they are right , one can only hope that america has a plan b .
meanwhile , commodity prices will continue to rise , with oil expor@@ ters now constitu@@ ting the largest contribu@@ tors to america ’ s gap@@ ing trade deficit .
maybe the real us strategy is to try to owe the commodi@@ ty-@@ expor@@ ting countries so much money that they will feel dependent on making america happy !
that is one twist that pre@@ bisch would never have anticipated .
whose champi@@ ons , anyway ?
the links between states and companies have grabbed headlines , most recently in russia , where president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin seems obsessed with creating “ national champi@@ ons ” in the energy and aero@@ space sectors .
such efforts seem but a part of a surge of prote@@ c@@ tion@@ ism in european political debate about business , especially when it comes to cross-@@ border ac@@ quisi@@ tions .
across europe , governments position themselves to be seen as defending “ national ” players from “ foreign ” competitors .
“ economic patrio@@ tism , ” the slogan coined by france ’ s prime minister domini@@ que de vil@@ lep@@ in following pep@@ si@@ co ’ s ru@@ mor@@ ed attempt in july 2005 to take@@ over dan@@ one , perhaps best en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ates the political imperative .
although de vil@@ lep@@ in ’ s speeches are more flam@@ boy@@ ant than those of most political leaders , the underlying senti@@ ment exten@@ ds far beyond france .
the same impulse appears to be at work behind italy ’ s policy on auto@@ stra@@ de , spain ’ s on en@@ des@@ a , poland ’ s on its banking sector , the former swedish prime minister ’ s on volvo , german un@@ ease about “ loc@@ ust ” -like funds on deutsche börse , or the united kingdom ’ s ever louder defense of the london stock exchange ’ s independence from the united states .
the basic belief that under@@ pins “ economic patrio@@ tism ” is that of an alig@@ nment of interests between companies considered “ national ” ( most promin@@ ently the largest ones or so-called “ champi@@ ons ” ) , their national employees , and the national community .
according to de vil@@ lep@@ in , “ to defend the employees ’ interests well , we must protect the interests of our companies . ”
he later argued that dan@@ one should be considered “ french ” because its “ milk collection and its water sources are in france . ”
but dan@@ one ’ s own fil@@ ings indicate that only 22 % of its global sales and less than 14 % of its global workforce are in france .
in fact , the link between european companies and national communities is becoming more ten@@ u@@ ous by the day .
research that i carried out for bru@@ egel surve@@ yed the largest 100 listed companies head@@ quar@@ tered in europe ( ran@@ ked by market capit@@ alization ) and analyzed the geographical distribution of their revenue , which is increasingly transparent since the adoption of international financial reporting standards ( i@@ fr@@ s ) last year .
europe was divided into eight broad zones , com@@ prising individual countries like germany , france , and italy , or grou@@ p@@ ings of smaller countries such as ben@@ elu@@ x and the nor@@ dic area .
the survey then calculated the share of revenue earned by each company in the zone in which it is head@@ quar@@ tered ( or “ home base ” ) , the rest of europe , and the rest of the world .
where relevant information for companies was available , the comparable distribution of employees was also examined .
the results show that the share of the home base in total revenue has become , on average , relatively low : just three-@@ eigh@@ ths , or 3@@ 7.@@ 5 % , on average for europe ’ s largest 100 companies .
of course , this figure covers a wide diversity of industries , and also some geographical differences across the continent .
for example , the aver@@ ages for german ( 34 % ) or french ( 35 % ) companies are marke@@ dly lower than for their spanish ( 56 % ) or italian ( 65 % ) counter@@ parts .
but the general trend is un@@ ambiguous .
for a broadly representative sub-@@ sample of 55 companies that could be tracked since 1997 , the proportion of revenue generated in the home region has fallen shar@@ ply on average , from 50@@ .@@ 2 % to 3@@ 6.@@ 9 % .
for these companies , sales to the “ rest of europe , ” which represented an average of less than 30 % of total european sales in 1997 , rose above 43 % in 2005 .
if the trend is extra@@ pol@@ ated , the home bases of europe ’ s largest companies will account , on average , for less than half of their european revenue , and less than a third of their global revenue , before the end of this decade .
these companies are “ europe@@ ani@@ zing ” fast , and the relative weight of their home base is declining even faster .
moreover , this is not just a story about sales .
the survey also measured the geographical distribution of employees relative to the distribution of revenue .
while the distribution profiles between employees and revenue could be shar@@ ply dis@@ similar in some companies , on average they were almost identical : for a sub-@@ sample of 73 companies among europe ’ s top 100 , the home base represented 37 % of employees and 35 % of revenue on average in 2005 , while the rest of europe accoun@@ ted for 29 % of employees and 28 % of revenue .
this strongly suggests that jobs broadly “ follow ” sales ( or perhaps the other way round ) , even though , once again , this is true only on average and not for all companies .
what are the implications for policymakers ?
put simply , the numbers show a growing gap of interests between these so-called “ champi@@ ons ” and their national home bases .
for europe ’ s governments , fo@@ stering champi@@ ons increasingly means providing benefits to non-@@ national customers and employees – a du@@ bi@@ ous use of taxpa@@ yer money .
another consequence is that regul@@ atory competition is likely to increase in europe , as companies are less bound by local interests to keep their headquarters at “ home ” if the tax or regul@@ atory environment becomes un@@ favor@@ able .
the decision by de@@ pf@@ a bank to shift its headquarters from wies@@ ba@@ den to du@@ bli@@ n in 2002 may be a sign of things to come .
the biggest risk is that the growing disconnect between the perception of “ national ” companies and the reality of europe@@ ani@@ zation may lead to spectac@@ ularly ill-@@ jud@@ ged policies .
it is high time for business leaders to be more can@@ did about where their real constitu@@ encies lie , and for national politicians to recognize that they can no longer wi@@ eld control over the giants of today ’ s european business .
whose corporate social responsibility ?
new york – increasingly , corporations are under pressure , often from activist non-@@ governmental organizations , to take on specific “ corporate social responsibility ” ( c@@ s@@ r ) obli@@ ga@@ tions .
but the fact that c@@ s@@ r is being demand@@ ed , and occasionally conce@@ ded , does not ensure clarity about either its rationale or the ways in which it should be under@@ taken .
c@@ s@@ r can be divided into two categories : what corporations should do ( say , contribute to a women ’ s rights ngo or build a village school ) and what they should not do ( say , dump mer@@ cur@@ y into rivers or bury ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous materials in land@@ fills ) .
the lat@@ ter is wh@@ olly conventional and subject to regulation ( and recently to questions about how corporations should behave when there are no ho@@ st-@@ country regulations ) .
but are c@@ s@@ r obli@@ ga@@ tions really good practice ?
mil@@ ton friedman and other cri@@ tics often asked if it was the business of businesses to practice corporate altruism .
prior to the rise of the corporation , there were mainly family firms , such as the ro@@ th@@ schil@@ ds .
when they made money , it acc@@ ru@@ ed princi@@ p@@ ally to the family itself .
altruism , where it existed , also was under@@ taken by the family , which decided how and on what to spend its money .
whether the firm or its share@@ holders and other stake@@ holders spent the money was beside the point .
with the rise of the business corporation , large family firms have generally disappeared .
but that does not mean that a corporation is the right entity to engage in altruism – though its various stake@@ holders obviously can spend any portion of the income they earn from the corporation and other sources in altru@@ istic ways .
instead of c@@ s@@ r , we should have ps@@ r ( personal social responsibility ) .
one can also argue for ps@@ r on the grounds that asking for c@@ s@@ r becomes a way of “ passing the bu@@ ck ” – ev@@ ading personal responsibility for doing good .
this is the flip side of bl@@ aming corporations for everything from obesity to scal@@ ding from sp@@ illed coffee – both the subject of law@@ suits in recent years .
there is also an added advantage in replacing c@@ s@@ r with ps@@ r : there is virtue in diversity of approaches to altruism .
chair@@ man mao wanted a hundred flowers to bloom , but only so that he could cut them all off at their roots .
but ps@@ r is more like president george h@@ .@@ w. bush ’ s metaphor of a “ thousand points of light . ”
moreover , it is hard to see how a corporation ’ s stake@@ holders can always arrive democra@@ tically at a common position on how the corporation should engage in social responsibility on their behalf .
each will consider his or her c@@ s@@ r view the best .
but there are strong arguments in favor of c@@ s@@ r as well .
first , the political reality is that society tre@@ ats corporations as if they were persons , which is often also a legal reality for many purposes .
society increasingly demands that these “ corporate citizens ” be altru@@ istic , just as people are .
given this reality , corporations want to give simply because it is expected of them .
such c@@ s@@ r builds the firm ’ s image as a “ good ” corporation , just as giving by bill gates and warren buffet builds their image as “ good ” billion@@ aires .
second , many corporations view c@@ s@@ r as an effective defen@@ sive strategy against powerful activist ngos ( such as greenpeace ) that have taken to using online ag@@ itation , boy@@ cot@@ ts , and other means to “ black@@ mail ” targeted corporations into ac@@ ce@@ ding to the activists ’ demands .
the more c@@ s@@ r a company can point to , the less such efforts will succeed – or even be mounted .
consider the contra@@ sting experiences of coke and pepsi .
coke has been targeted by ngos for alle@@ ged lap@@ ses in labor and environmental standards .
by contrast , pepsi , which once te@@ amed up with at &amp; t and the cia to ou@@ st president sal@@ v@@ ad@@ or all@@ ende in chile , smells like a rose nowadays , because it has distributed c@@ s@@ r lar@@ ges@@ se to several causes that influential ngos embrace .
that is a lesson that wal-mart has since learned .
in 2005 , the service employees ’ international union ( sei@@ u ) created wal-mart watch , with an annual budget of $ 5 million .
the purpose was to make wal-mart a “ better emplo@@ yer , neighbor , and corporate citizen , ” and wal-mart eventually capit@@ ulated on some of the sei@@ u ’ s specific demands as well .
finally , c@@ s@@ r can be simply a matter of advertising .
in this case , the choice of c@@ s@@ r spending is focused directly on generating added revenue , much like advertising , and is aimed at sales much the way advertising is .
a benign example is adi@@ das ’ s sponsor@@ ship of tennis tour@@ nam@@ ents .
a mal@@ ign example is philip mor@@ ris ’ s donation of money to museums , symphony orchestras , and opera houses , cy@@ ni@@ cally aimed at buying off artists who might otherwise work to ban cigarettes .
all these ration@@ ales for c@@ s@@ r suggest that it should be left to each corporation to determine , just as ps@@ r leaves altruism to each individual ’ s conscience and sense of what needs supporting .
the attempt by some ngos and activists to impose a stra@@ it@@ jacket on c@@ s@@ r , reflecting their priorities , is mis@@ guided and must be rejected .
instead , the model should be former united nations secretary general kofi annan ’ s initiative , the global compact .
what annan has done is to embrace ten wide-@@ ranging gui@@ ding principles while leaving sig@@ nat@@ ory corporations free to choose that which they wish to support actively .
in recent weeks , leaders of various opposition organizations in georgia , such as anti@@ sor@@ os and fairness , have been ja@@ iled on unfair acc@@ us@@ ations of plot@@ ting a coup on behalf of russia .
but the wave of political repres@@ sion merely reflects president mik@@ ha@@ il sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i ’ s desperate effort to cling to power .
with popular dis@@ sent growing and opposition forces streng@@ th@@ ening , the authorities have sought to contro@@ ll non-@@ governmental organizations ( ngos ) and streng@@ then the security forces .
but this will only make mass prote@@ sts inevitable , ultimately je@@ opar@@ di@@ zing the democratic transition in georgia that sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i claims to represent .
sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i sees a “ moscow hand ” in every challenge to his authority , which could be explained by his government ’ s close alliance with the united states .
but the people ro@@ unded up in the latest raid against the opposition were originally im@@ pris@@ oned by edu@@ ard she@@ var@@ na@@ d@@ ze ’ s government , which sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i helped de@@ pose in georgia ’ s supposedly democratic “ rose revolution ” in 2003 .
the latest events clearly indicate that a c@@ zar@@ ist mentality survived the revolution , reflected in a by@@ z@@ ant@@ ine model of political power — an emper@@ or and his court — that has as its main vehicle largely un@@ constrained presidential authority .
before the security forces targeted the opposition blo@@ c that i represent , suppor@@ ters of educational reforms were pro@@ secu@@ ted , while most of the press is under the influence of the government .
sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i claims that the opposition forces that i represent op@@ pose western values .
but we advocate parli@@ am@@ ent@@ ar@@ ism – genuine separation of executive and leg@@ isla@@ tive power – in georgia .
and , in supporting the western model of parli@@ am@@ ent@@ ari@@ ans@@ m , we are on the side of georgia , not russia .
it is strange that sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i , a graduate of columbia law school , fails to see the dispar@@ ity between his own democratic rhetoric and auto@@ cratic actions .
thus , those of us who value georgia ’ s historical ties with russia are called , at best , “ arch@@ ai@@ sts , ” and at worst “ enemies of geor@@ gian independence , ” as if georgia would become a russian colony if we ever came to power .
but what separ@@ ates us from sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i is that we understand that history , geography , and economics dic@@ tate close ties to russia .
we simply see no contradiction between that stance and support for western values .
indeed , even russia , with all its im@@ perfe@@ ctions , cannot be said to op@@ pose western values .
the unfortunate paradox in georgia – and elsewhere in the post-@@ soviet world – is that self-@@ serving pro-@@ western rhetoric has often led democratic values to be sacrifi@@ ced in favor of a new dictator@@ ship .
when the west actively supports popular revolutions , as in georgia and ukra@@ ine , the newly established power reli@@ es on democratic slo@@ gans , not democratic behavior .
she@@ var@@ d@@ na@@ d@@ ze , too , was initially viewed as a symbol of post-@@ soviet geor@@ gian democracy .
as a government minister in 1993 , however , i was already hearing cia officials express concern that a “ mafia state ” was being created instead .
first with she@@ var@@ na@@ d@@ ze , and now with sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i , popular dis@@ illusion@@ ment reflects not reje@@ ction of democracy , but frustration with its continuing absence .
sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i is evi@@ dently mes@@ m@@ eri@@ zed by the us , and the west in general , but what is the point if there is no independent and democratic political process in georgia today ?
and why , then , is sustaining close ties to the us so des@@ ir@@ able , while ref@@ using to dis@@ miss russia as a partner is regarded as being an agent of the kre@@ m@@ lin ?
is the us , in contrast to russia , by definition honest , innocent , and high-@@ minded ?
there should be no place for such unfortunate double standards .
regardless of what the sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i government claims about his oppon@@ ents , our political orientation is not pro-@@ russian , but pro-@@ geor@@ gian .
we believe that georgia should pursue its own interests , which it may share with europe , russia , or the us , but which are nonetheless our own .
we have no interest in merely execu@@ ting us policy , or in bas@@ ing georgia ’ s foreign and domestic policy sol@@ ely on distan@@ cing the country from russia , as sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i has done .
thus , pro-@@ geor@@ gian politics should not coun@@ ten@@ ance nation@@ alism .
nowadays , some of our politicians have embraced the slogan “ georgia for geor@@ gi@@ ans . ”
but nation@@ alism suggests the lack of a coherent conception of georgia ’ s interests .
georgia ’ s tradition as a multinational , tolerant state , which has been weak@@ ened in the last 15 years , must be rein@@ vi@@ gor@@ ated , because we have no need for enemies against which to define ourselves .
a strong relationship with russia need not come at the expense of relations with america and the west , and vice versa .
georgia should be neither pro-@@ russian nor pro-@@ american .
it is a small , poor country that desperately needs stability and economic development .
its model should not be palestine and permanent battle , but switzerland and permanent prosperity .
whose war on terror ?
“ we are all americans , ” wrote le mon@@ de on september 12 , 2001 . and so it was with most people in the muslim world , who were as app@@ alled as anyone else at the car@@ na@@ ge of the terrorist attacks on washington and new york .
indeed , when america responded to the attacks , almost no one m@@ our@@ ned the fall of the taliban , who were univers@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ned for their fana@@ ticism .
this un@@ anim@@ ity of opinion no longer exists .
in the five years since the attacks , two audiences for the so-called “ war on terror ” have emerged .
indeed , as the “ war ” progr@@ essed , the audience closest to the action began to see the emerging combat in a way that was diam@@ et@@ ri@@ cally opposed to that of the united states and the west .
to the us administration , every act in the drama of the war on terror was seen as dis@@ crete and self-@@ contained : afghanistan , iraq , palestine , and he@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h in lebanon .
the bush administration , having pro@@ cla@@ imed a war on terror , invaded and occupied countries , and yet failed to see that these events were being linked in the eyes of people in the region .
glu@@ ed to al jazeera and other arab satellite channels , the various bat@@ tles of the “ war on terror ” came to be viewed as a single chain of events in a grand plot against islam .
worse yet , america wa@@ ved the ban@@ ner of democracy as it pro@@ secu@@ ted its wars . but hopes for democracy , be it secular or islam@@ ist , for the people concerned have been buried in the ru@@ bble and car@@ na@@ ge of bag@@ h@@ dad , bei@@ rut , and kan@@ da@@ har .
many muslims understand – as well as anyone in the west , and in the same terms – the underlying causes of the ali@@ en@@ ation that anima@@ tes islamic radi@@ cal@@ ism and violence . they know that the rigid dictator@@ ships of the region have paralyzed their populations . only those consumed by the fires of their rage seem able to melt the shack@@ les of these authoritarian societies .
but the price of escape is a kind of de@@ formation .
em@@ bit@@ tered , fana@@ tical , ven@@ ge@@ ful : those who rebel against the status quo enter the wider world seeking re@@ tali@@ ation , not just against the regimes that de@@ formed them , but against the west , which pro@@ pped up the region ’ s author@@ it@@ arians in the interest of “ stability . ”
many muslims also understand that the problem of palestine , uns@@ ol@@ ved for three generations , goes beyond the suffering of the palestinian people . they know that the region ’ s dictators have used palestine to justify their mis@@ rule and to avoid political and economic liber@@ alization .
so when america called for democracy , the hearts of many in the region so@@ ared with the hope that reform would come at last . but america , as so many times before , let them down .
as people at last began to hope for more liberal and decent societies , the us continued to end@@ or@@ se the regimes that were repres@@ sing them . america simply could not ad@@ here to its own democra@@ cy@@ -@@ promotion script .
after the ou@@ ster of the taliban in afghanistan , the us turned its si@@ ghts on the secular dictator@@ ship of saddam hussein ’ s iraq . instead of encouraging reform of the saudi / wa@@ h@@ hab@@ i regime – the system that spa@@ wned 15 of the 19 hi@@ jac@@ kers in the 9 / 11 attacks – the average muslim saw america as wa@@ ging war on a regime that had nothing to do with that crime .
many muslims acqui@@ es@@ ced in this devi@@ ation , viewing the invasion of iraq as part of the passing of dictator@@ ship and the coming of democracy . but the blood@@ sta@@ ined sham@@ bles of the us occupation led america to abandon the quest for democracy .
the deeper america sank into the ira@@ qi qu@@ ag@@ mi@@ re , the more the us began to turn a blind eye to the region ’ s surviving dictators , particularly those in saudi arabia , syria , egypt , and pakistan .
indeed , the last thing the region ’ s dictators wanted to see was a democratic iraq .
almost from the moment of saddam ’ s fall , saudi / wa@@ h@@ hab@@ i ji@@ ha@@ dis poured into iraq almost un@@ im@@ pe@@ ded .
worse yet , the muslims who supported the project to democra@@ tize iraq widely suspect that the sun@@ ni resistance that inc@@ ited the ira@@ qi civil war has been finan@@ ced by saudi oil money .
( terrorism also kept ira@@ qi oil from becoming a serious challen@@ ger to saudi arabia . )
so the effort to democra@@ tize iraq – indeed , the entire american project to democra@@ tize the region – has fallen under deep suspi@@ cion by even the most moder@@ ate of muslims .
america , they believe , only wants a democracy that suits its interests .
lebanon ’ s “ ce@@ dar revolution , ” which gal@@ vani@@ zed the west in the same way as ukra@@ ine ’ s orange revolution , has been systematically under@@ min@@ ed .
with democracy in most of the region still a long way off – indeed , perhaps a more distant prospect now than five years ago – us secretary of state con@@ do@@ le@@ e@@ zz@@ a rice repe@@ ats her mantra that the dead civili@@ ans of bei@@ rut , si@@ don , ty@@ re , and gaza represent the “ birth pan@@ gs ” of a new middle east .
but until the west stops regar@@ ding dead babies as political pro@@ ps , we cannot understand how the muslim world percei@@ ves all that has happened since september 11 , 2001 .
only then will we understand why the unified view of five years ago has frac@@ tured so viol@@ ently .
whose world bank ?
new york – us president barack obama ’ s nom@@ ination of jim y@@ ong kim for the pres@@ iden@@ cy of the world bank has been well received – and rightly so , especially given some of the other names that were ban@@ died about .
in kim , a publi@@ c-@@ health professor who is now president of dar@@ t@@ mouth college and previously led the world health organization ’ s hiv / aids department , the united states has put forward a good candidate .
but the candidate ’ s nation@@ ality , and the nomin@@ ating country – whether small and poor or large and rich – should play no role in determin@@ ing who gets the job .
the world bank ’ s 11 executive directors from emerging and developing countries have put forward two excellent candidates , n@@ go@@ zi o@@ kon@@ jo-@@ i@@ weal@@ a of nigeria and jose antonio o@@ camp@@ o of colom@@ bia .
i have worked closely with both of them .
both are first-@@ rate , have served as ministers with multiple portfoli@@ os , have performed ad@@ mir@@ ably in top positions in multi@@ lat@@ eral organizations , and have the diplo@@ matic skills and professional compe@@ tence to do an out@@ standing job .
they understand finance and economics , the bread and butter of the world bank , and have a network of connections to leverage the bank ’ s effectiveness .
o@@ camp@@ o , like kim , brings the advantages and dis@@ advantages of being an outsi@@ der ; but o@@ camp@@ o , a distingu@@ ished professor at columbia university , is thorough@@ ly ac@@ qua@@ in@@ ted with the world bank .
he previously served not only as minister of economics and finance , but also of agriculture – a critically important quali@@ fication , given that the vast majority of the developing countries ’ poor depend on farming .
he also brings impressive environmental cre@@ denti@@ als , addressing another of the bank &apos;s central concerns .
both o@@ kon@@ jo-@@ i@@ weal@@ a and o@@ camp@@ o understand the role of international financial institutions in providing global public goods .
throughout their careers , their hearts and minds have been devoted to development , and to fulfilling the world bank ’ s mission of eliminating poverty .
they have set a high bar for any american candidate .
much is at stake .
almost two billion people remain in poverty in the developing world , and , while the world bank cannot solve the problem on its own , it plays a leading role .
despite its name , the bank is primarily an international development institution .
kim ’ s speci@@ alty , public health , is critical , and the bank has long supported innovative initi@@ atives in this field . but health is only a small part of the bank ’ s “ portfolio , ” and it typically works in this area with partners who bring to the table expertise in medicine .
ru@@ mor@@ s suggest that the us is likely to insist on maintaining the per@@ verse selection process in which it gets to pick the world bank ’ s president , simply because , in this election year , obama ’ s oppon@@ ents would trum@@ pet loss of control over the choice as a sign of weakness .
and it is more important for the us to retain that control than it is for emerging and developing countries to ob@@ tain it .
indeed , the more powerful of the emerging markets know how to live within the current system , and they may use it to their advantage .
they will , in effect , ob@@ tain an io@@ u , to be c@@ ashed in for something that is more important .
the real@@ politik of the moment makes fighting over the pres@@ iden@@ cy unlikely ; america may well pre@@ va@@ il .
should america continue to insist on controlling the selection process , it is the bank itself that would suffer .
for years , the bank ’ s effectiveness was com@@ promised because it was seen , in part , as a tool of western governments and their countries ’ financial and corporate sectors .
ironically , even america ’ s long-term interests would be best served by a commitment – not just in words , but also in dee@@ ds – to a mer@@ it-@@ based system and good governance .
one supposed achievement of the g-@@ 20 was an agreement to reform the governance of the international financial institutions – most importantly , how their leaders are selected .
since expertise on development by and large lies within the emerging and developing countries – after all , they live development – it seems natural that the world bank ’ s head would come from one of those countries .
to maintain a cab@@ al among developed countries , where@@ by the us ap@@ points the world bank president and europe picks the international mon@@ etary fund ’ s head , seems particularly an@@ ach@@ r@@ oni@@ stic and per@@ ple@@ x@@ ing today , when the bank and the fund are turning to emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market countries as a source of funds .
while the us , the international community , and the bank itself repeatedly emphasize the importance of good governance , a selection procedure that de fac@@ to leaves the appointment to the us president makes a mo@@ cker@@ y of it .
o@@ kon@@ jo-@@ i@@ weal@@ a put the matter for@@ ce@@ fully in an interview with the financial times : what is at stake is a matter of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
the integrity of the advanced industrial countries , which have a majority of the votes at the world bank , is being put to the test .
who should be helped first ?
the list of urgent challenges facing humanity is depres@@ sing@@ ly long .
aids , hunger , armed conflict , and global warming compete for attention alongside government failure , malaria , and the latest natural disaster .
while our compassion is great , our resources are limited .
so who should be helped first ?
to some , making such priorities seems ob@@ scene .
but the united nations and national governments spend billions of dollars each year trying to help those in need without explicitly considering whether they are achieving the most that they can .
the western media focuses on a tsunami in asia ; donations flow freely .
an earthquake that deva@@ states pakistan gar@@ ners fewer headlines , so the developed world gives a lot less .
there is a better way .
we could prioritize our spending to achieve the greatest benefit for our money .
this month , i will ask un ambassad@@ ors how they would spend $ 50 billion to reduce suffering .
they will repeat the same exercise that some of the world ’ s best economists tac@@ kl@@ ed in a 2004 project called the “ copenhagen consensus ” : weigh@@ ing up solutions to the great challenges facing the world , and deciding what should be done first .
but the question shouldn ’ t be left to politicians or nobel laure@@ ates alone .
we must all engage in the debate .
one hopes that this task has been made slightly simpler by the publication of a book in which the copenhagen consensus economists boil down their insights .
here ’ s one fact to consider : the entire death toll from the southeast asian tsunami is matched each month by the number of worldwide casu@@ alties of hiv / aids .
a comprehensive prevention program providing free or cheap condoms and information about safe sex to the regions worst affected by hiv / aids would cost $ 27 billion and save more than 28 million lives .
this , say the economists who took part in the copenhagen consensus , makes it the single best investment that the world could possibly make .
the social benefits would out@@ weigh the costs by 40 to one .
other options that the economists favor@@ ed spending some of their $ 50 billion include providing micro-@@ nutrients to the world ’ s hungry , establi@@ shing free trade , and bat@@ tling malaria with mosquito nets and medication .
at the other end of the scale , responses to climate change like the kyoto protocol would cost more than they would achieve , so the economists crossed them off the list of things to do right now .
regardless of whether we agree with the economists , everybody must admit that we cannot do everything at once .
often , politicians avoid priori@@ tization .
why ?
there are many interested parties .
no group wants their solution to come last , and no government wants its country ’ s national challenges to be over@@ looked .
the un conference won ’ t be easy .
but it shows that there is a will to put priori@@ tization squ@@ ar@@ ely at the center of attention .
it will produce a “ to do ” list that will demonstrate how to achieve the most that we can for humanity , which could lead , in turn , to more transparent decision-making .
the principles of economics provide a sound basis on which to make rational choices .
now , the discussion needs to shift from the academic sphere to political life .
it ’ s time for all of us to consider and compare our own priority lists .
we must endeavor to sh@@ orten the list of challenges facing humanity .
but that requires all of us to engage in a debate about what we need to do first .
who should lead the world bank ?
washington , dc – robert zo@@ elli@@ ck will de@@ part in june as president of the world bank , once again raising the thor@@ ny issue of leadership of the brett@@ on woods twins ( the bank and the international mon@@ etary fund ) .
at their birth , john may@@ n@@ ard key@@ nes memor@@ ably war@@ ned that if these institutions did not get good leaders they would “ fall into an eternal sl@@ um@@ ber , never to wa@@ ken or be heard of again in the courts and markets of mankind . ”
getting a good leader , of course , requires a careful selection process .
today , however , the world is stuck with just the opposite : a dread@@ fully antiqu@@ ated process where@@ by the united states and europe , despite their economic tra@@ va@@ ils , retain a monopoly on the leadership of the bank and the imf , respe@@ ctively .
there is gru@@ d@@ ging agreement that this system should change . but the forces perpetu@@ ating the status quo – european and american resistance to change and emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market countries ’ passi@@ vity – remain powerful , as the choice last year of christ@@ ine la@@ gar@@ de to lead the imf illu@@ strated .
elec@@ tion-@@ year politics in the us will streng@@ then these forces further , with president barack obama ’ s administration unlikely to rel@@ in@@ qu@@ ish a symbol of global power , which would invite oppon@@ ents ’ charges of weak leadership .
but , in some ways , the easy part is to state the case for the obvious : the bank requires a new selection process that will enable it to choose the most qualified person , regardless of nation@@ ality .
the more difficult part is to identify the qualifi@@ cations needed to run the bank at a time when its role must be adapted to far-@@ reaching global changes .
that means that more of the poorest countries will therefore graduate out of the need for conc@@ essi@@ onal len@@ ding from the bank .
the bank ’ s non-@@ conc@@ essi@@ onal len@@ ding agency , the international bank for reconstruction and development , may well retain its rationale , especially because three-@@ four@@ ths of the world ’ s poor now resi@@ de in middle-@@ income countries .
but easier access to private finance will force a re-@@ evaluation of the i@@ br@@ d ’ s methods and the magnitude of its len@@ ding .
for example , countries may want the bank to continue to provide neutral advice and set standards on pro@@ cu@@ rement and quality , but without the high trans@@ actions costs that have become the hall@@ mark of bank finance .
looking ahead , the bank will have to shift from len@@ ding to governments towards finan@@ cing the pro@@ vision of global public goods .
a more successful developing world also poses an intellectual challenge to the bank as a cu@@ sto@@ dian of research and policy thinking in the field of development economics .
the bank , which has drawn pre@@ domin@@ antly upon us-@@ based centers of learning , can no longer ply a single model or dic@@ tate from a universal template .
to be fair , the bank has embraced the message of ec@@ lec@@ ticism , but a new leader will have to go further , paying greater attention to the specific contexts and demands of individual bor@@ ro@@ wers and learning from a wider set of successful development experiences .
the bank ’ s major share@@ holders also face a stark choice .
if they believe that the bank has a meaningful future worth supporting , it is the rapidly growing emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market countries , not the inde@@ b@@ ted west , that can provide the resources ( this means china , of course , but even brazil and india have growing aid programs ) .
in return , they will rightly demand a greater voice in running the bank , especially if the bank ’ s focus shifts towards global public goods .
but if the status quo powers are un@@ willing to ce@@ de control , the system of official international finan@@ cing established by brett@@ on woods will become increasingly fragmented .
countries like china will be rein@@ forced in their belief that going it alone is the best option , with ad@@ verse consequences for multi@@ lat@@ er@@ alism .
these dramatic shifts and daunting challenges mean that the world bank ’ s next president will have to be someone whose primary task is to initi@@ ate and sustain change while command@@ ing support and legiti@@ macy across the bank ’ s mem@@ ber@@ ship .
he or she will also require a demonstrated capacity for political leadership and a core convi@@ ction that the bank needs a new vision and path forward .
it is imperative that the selection process be altered to bro@@ aden the search for candidates who are sensitive to changing realities and poss@@ ess key qualifi@@ cations .
the current selection procedure is losing legiti@@ macy in a changing world , and it carries greater risks of a bad outcome : an un@@ suitable candidate .
the consequences of re@@ taining it might not be as dramatic as key@@ nes ’ pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied , but there is a real possibility that the bank will o@@ ssi@@ fy into an institution whose increasingly im@@ pover@@ ished g-@@ 7 donors dispen@@ se progressively smaller sums of money in the same question@@ able ways to a shrinking number of supp@@ li@@ can@@ ts .
pre@@ pping gay men for pre@@ p
london – in october , two groups researching the effectiveness of a potential breakthrough drug in the fight against hiv did something unusual . they announced that the therapy they were testing , an antiretro@@ viral drug called tru@@ v@@ ada , had proved effective enough to end the random@@ ized phases of the trials , and that they were offering the pill to all of the studies ’ participants .
the researchers found that gay men who take tru@@ v@@ ada , in addition to using condoms when they have sex , were significantly less likely to contract hiv .
this is further evidence of the effectiveness of pre-@@ exposure pro@@ phy@@ la@@ x@@ is ( pre@@ p ) , a technique by which people who are hiv-@@ negative use antiretro@@ viral drugs to protect themselves from infection .
in 2011 , a trial funded by the gates foundation found that straight couples using tru@@ v@@ ada reduced the risk of transmit@@ ting hiv by 73 % .
those fighting to prevent the spread of hiv / aids thus have a new tool in their arsenal .
the question now is how best to deliver it to those who need it most : gay men in developing countries .
this summer , the world health organization took an important step to that end , recommen@@ ding pre@@ p for all gay men and men who have sex with men , making it the first major international health organization to do so .
the who estimates that increased use of pre@@ p could reduce hiv infections by up to 25 % over the next decade among men who have sex with men ( this category includes anyone with elevated risk , not just those who identify as gay ) .
but an important obstacle remains : the legal predi@@ cam@@ ent of gay men in much of the developing world .
in countries like nigeria , where anti-@@ homosexu@@ ality legislation has recently been approved , those following the who ’ s new pre@@ p guidelines could find themselves subject to im@@ prison@@ ment .
the climate of officially sanc@@ tioned hom@@ opho@@ bia in nigeria has already set back the fight against aids .
in 2006 , a study found that 13 % of men who have sex with men in nigeria were hiv-positive , compared to 4.@@ 5 % of all nigeri@@ ans .
meanwhile , an increasing number of men reported encounter@@ ing hom@@ opho@@ bia at healthcare centers , making them less likely to seek help .
the consequences could not be more serious .
two years ago , a young hiv-positive nigerian man cont@@ acted me on facebook to tell me about his monthly or@@ deal at the clinic .
the nurse at the hospital spent more time lec@@ turing him on the ev@@ ils of homosexu@@ ality than telling him about the drugs he was taking and their possible side effects .
the man , a third-@@ year medical student , told me that he had decided to stop going to the clinic .
when i asked how he would continue treatment , he said that he had a friend abroad who could get him the drugs .
less than two years later , i saw a facebook update announcing his death .
my facebook friend is not the only one who has paid the price for nigeria ’ s hom@@ opho@@ bia .
a pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary report from the solidar@@ ity alliance nigeria , a coalition of gay , les@@ bian , bis@@ ex@@ ual , and trans@@ gender ( l@@ g@@ bt ) organizations , details a huge decrease in the use of hiv services by men who have sex with men in the six months following the en@@ ac@@ tment of the anti-@@ gay legislation .
the decrease ranges from 40 % in lagos – nigeria ’ s most co@@ smo@@ poli@@ tan city – to 70 % in kan@@ o , a pre@@ domin@@ antly muslim state .
nigeri@@ ans living with hiv must do more than just fight the infection ; they also must brave social stigma , weather discrimin@@ ation by secular and religious institutions , and now , potentially , face threats from the legal system .
in this environment , the promise of pre@@ p begins to di@@ m , as the risks of seeking treatment out@@ weigh the potentially life-saving benefits .
the story is similar in uganda .
last spring , as legal per@@ secu@@ tion of ga@@ ys there mounted , the government ra@@ i@@ ded an hiv clinic and with@@ held its operating license for providing care and support to hiv-positive men who have sex with men .
as an african activist with more than ten years of experience in the fight against hiv , i hope that the who will build on its important first step of advis@@ ing the use of pre@@ p .
that means initi@@ ating a public conversation with countries like nigeria , uganda , g@@ ambia , and russia on the importance of inclu@@ sion in the battle against hiv .
the who should make it clear that while it may not be advoc@@ ating for l@@ g@@ bt political rights , it is determined to ensure that all those who can benefit from pre@@ p are able to access the necessary drugs , without fear of legal consequences .
researchers , drug companies , and human-@@ rights campaig@@ ners must take up the fight to ensure that pre@@ p is made available – without risk – to those who need it most .
who should safe@@ guard financial stability ?
new haven – central bankers around the world failed to see the current financial crisis coming before its beginnings in 2007 .
martin č@@ ih@@ á@@ k of the international mon@@ etary fund reported in july 2007 that , of 47 central banks found to publish financial stability reports ( fs@@ rs ) , “ virtually all ” gave a “ positive overall assessment of their domestic financial system ” in their most recent reports .
and yet , although these central banks failed us before the crisis , they should still play the lead role in preventing the next crisis .
that is the conclusion , perhaps counterintuitive , that the squ@@ am lake group &#91; htt@@ p : / / squ@@ am@@ la@@ ke@@ grou@@ p@@ .org / &#93; , a think tank of 15 academic financial economists to which i belong , reached in our recently published report , fixing the financial system .
macro@@ -@@ p@@ ru@@ den@@ tial regul@@ ators ( government officials who focus not on the sound@@ ness of individual financial institutions , but rather on the stability of the whole financial system ) are sor@@ ely needed , and central bankers are the logical people to fill this role .
other regul@@ ators did no better in predicting this crisis , and are even less su@@ ited to prevent the next .
david cameron ’ s new government in the united kingdom apparently came to the same conclusion when it announced plans to transfer regul@@ atory authority from the financial services authority ( f@@ sa ) to the bank of england .
but agreement about the regul@@ atory role of central banks is not widely spread .
in the united states , for example , there is recognition of the importance of macro@@ -@@ p@@ ru@@ den@@ tial regulation , but not of giving this authority to the federal reserve .
the newly passed us finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ reform legislation ent@@ ru@@ sts macro@@ -@@ p@@ ru@@ den@@ tial policy to a new financial stability over@@ sight council .
that is good , but the us treas@@ ury secretary will be the council ’ s chair@@ man , and the fed , despite gaining some new powers , will for the most part be only one of many members .
the head of the council is thus a political ap@@ poin@@ tee who serves at the pleasure of the president .
recent history shows that political ap@@ poin@@ te@@ es often fail to take courageous or un@@ popular steps to stabilize the economy .
a modern us president certainly remembers how difficult it was to convince voters to put him where he is , and is perpe@@ tually campaigning to maintain approval ratings and to preserve his party ’ s pro@@ spe@@ cts in the next election .
the treas@@ ury secretary is part of the president ’ s team , and works next door to the white house .
george w. bush won the 2000 election , despite losing the popular vote .
in 2003 , bush chose as his treas@@ ury secretary john w. snow , a railroad president who , as bar@@ ron ’ s colum@@ n@@ ist alan ab@@ el@@ son put it , “ may not be the shar@@ pest knife in the cabinet . ” snow obli@@ ged the president and gave un@@ questioning support to his policies until leaving office in 2006 , just before the crisis erup@@ ted .
under the new law , snow would have been in charge of the stability of the entire us economy .
a successful economy , bush argued , requires that people learn to take responsibility for their actions , and policies aimed at boo@@ sting home ownership would in@@ cul@@ cate this virtue on a broader scale .
that sounded right to voters , especially if it meant government policies that encouraged the emerging real-@@ estate bubble and made their investments in homes so@@ ar in value .
snow echo@@ ed his boss . “ the american economy is co@@ iled like a spring and ready to go , ” he chir@@ ped in 2003 .
two years later , near the very height of the bubbles in the equity and housing markets , he declared that , “ we can be pleased that the economy is on a good and sustainable path . ”
but , to bush ’ s credit , he also brought in ben ber@@ nan@@ ke in 2006 as fed chair@@ man .
not part of bush ’ s team , ber@@ nan@@ ke was protected from political pressures by america ’ s long tradition of respect for the fed ’ s independence .
the choice of ber@@ nan@@ ke , an accomplished scholar , apparently reflected bush ’ s acceptance of the public ’ s expectation of a first-@@ rate ap@@ poin@@ tee .
the same problems occur in many other countries .
people who are chosen in part to win the next election often find their economic judgment constrained .
by contrast , in recent decades central bankers in many countries have gradually won acceptance for the principle of independence from day-to-day political pressures .
the public in much of the world now understands that central bankers will be allowed to do their work without interference from politicians .
there is a tradition of the central banker as a worl@@ dly philosopher , who stands up for long-term sensible policy , and this tradition makes it politically easier for central bankers to do the right thing .
in fact , while the world ’ s central banks did not see the current crisis coming and did not take steps before 2007 to relie@@ ve the pressures that led to it , they did react decisi@@ vely and energe@@ tically as the crisis un@@ folded , with coordinated international action .
this was facili@@ tated by the tradition of political independence and cooperation that has developed over the years among central bankers .
the crisis has under@@ sc@@ ored the u@@ t@@ most importance of macro@@ -@@ p@@ ru@@ den@@ tial regulation .
although our central bankers are not perfect judges of financial stability , they are still the people who are in the best political and institutional position to ensure it .
who &apos;s to blame for britain &apos;s euro aller@@ gy ?
for@@ ty years ago , charles de gau@@ lle said &quot; non &quot; to britain &apos;s request to join the european community .
by june 9 , british chan@@ cell@@ or of the ex@@ che@@ quer gordon brown will offer his own &quot; no &quot; to europe .
but britain &apos;s decision whether to join the single european currency , the euro , was taken long ago , and it was always going to be some version of &quot; no . &quot;
when france first invited britain to join the infant european enterprise , a decade before general de gau@@ lle bar@@ red the door , the super@@ ci@@ li@@ ous mand@@ ar@@ ins in britain &apos;s treas@@ ury en@@ su@@ red that britain would indi@@ gn@@ antly reject the offer .
treas@@ ury bureau@@ crats have remained predic@@ tably anti-@@ european ever since .
like the cour@@ tiers who surrounded louis x@@ vi@@ ii , they have forgotten nothing and learned nothing .
the only question now in doubt is whether brown &apos;s verdi@@ ct on the euro will be &quot; not quite yet , &quot; &quot; not before the next election , &quot; or just plain &quot; no . &quot;
it is a decision being taken virtually independently of prime minister tony blair , and even against his wishes .
blair believes that britain ought to join the euro , because he wants britain to be , as he puts it , &quot; at the heart of europe &quot; .
most comm@@ ent@@ ators ten@@ ded to assume that , if that &apos;s what tony blair wants , then sooner or later that is what will happen , because , after all , he is the prime minister .
the fla@@ w in this reasoning is that blair sur@@ rendered control of the single currency decision to the treas@@ ury early in his first term , and he has never had the courage or political strength to take it back .
it is sometimes said that tony blair is instinctively european ( though that is said less often since the iraq war ) .
but when he came to power , in 1997 , he was not able or willing to face down britain &apos;s traditional anti-@@ europe@@ an@@ ism ; in particular , he was not prepared to commit his government to event@@ ual euro mem@@ ber@@ ship .
blair &apos;s solution to his euro dilemma was to pretend that adopting the euro was not a major political decision , but a technical question , to be decided on &quot; purely &quot; economic grounds .
so , in october 1997 , gordon brown announced that he had de@@ vised five tests to see whether britain and the euro were su@@ ited to each other .
in due course , the treas@@ ury would reach a judgment that would be technically expert , economically im@@ partial , and politically neutral .
if tony blair ever believed any of this , he was a fool .
brown cla@@ imed that his five tests would produce answers that were plain and un@@ ambiguous .
yet , because they were all questions about the future , they would inevitably be based entirely on specu@@ lation .
where gordon brown himself really stands on the issue is unclear , because he is a deeply secre@@ tive man .
many believe that his primary concern in the euro debate is over how it affects his power vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis blair .
in any event , once the decision of principle had been sub@@ ordin@@ ated to o@@ sten@@ si@@ bly technical economic tests , it was un@@ avo@@ id@@ able that treas@@ ury mand@@ ar@@ ins , who are institution@@ ally opposed to european integration , would conduct them .
so the verdi@@ ct was always going to be &quot; no , &quot; which is why the only freedom of movement for blair and brown was going to be &quot; not yet . &quot;
imagine that the british government decides one day to go for euro mem@@ ber@@ ship , and to put the issue to the test of a refer@@ end@@ um .
at the moment , the elec@@ tor@@ ate is hostile to euro mem@@ ber@@ ship by a large margin ; if the government is to persuade the voters to change their minds on purely economic grounds , it must deploy a powerful case .
voters will not be impressed by the treas@@ ury &apos;s mum@@ bo-@@ jum@@ bo ; they will need strong , simple arguments that britain will be better off by joining .
if the british economy and the euro@@ -@@ zone economy are both doing well , the economic case for british mem@@ ber@@ ship is obviously weak .
the same is true if the british economy and the euro@@ -@@ zone economy are both doing badly .
if the british economy is doing well and the euro@@ -@@ zone economy is doing badly , there is no economic case whatsoever for british mem@@ ber@@ ship .
that is the current situation .
the only scenario in which there could be a strong , purely economic case for euro mem@@ ber@@ ship is one in which the euro@@ -@@ zone is doing very well , the british economy is doing very badly , and mem@@ ber@@ ship looks like the best way to deliver long-term recovery .
but if the british economy were doing very badly , the other member states might snu@@ b britain .
obviously , &quot; doing well &quot; and &quot; doing badly &quot; are cl@@ um@@ sy notions ; but we are talking about a refer@@ end@@ um , not about higher mathematics .
a refer@@ end@@ um on joining the euro probably cannot be won unless a british government is willing to say three things : first , that it favor@@ s closer eu political integration ; second , that the single currency is but one expression of that integration , and third , that it is committed to euro mem@@ ber@@ ship .
curi@@ ously , many voters who op@@ pose euro mem@@ ber@@ ship nonetheless believe that it will happen .
no doubt they would prefer the government to tell them the truth first .
who ’ s who on pu@@ tin ’ s pay@@ roll ?
moscow – germany ’ s ex-@@ chan@@ cell@@ or ger@@ hard schro@@ eder is a legend in russia .
he serves ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m ’ s interests for a meas@@ ly couple of million euros a year , sits in at sessions of the russian academy of sciences , and writes books about his sta@@ un@@ ch friendship with “ geno@@ sse w@@ la@@ di@@ mir , ” who , in the not-@@ so-@@ distant past , earned himself the well-@@ deser@@ ved nick@@ name of “ st@@ as@@ i ” among business circles in gang@@ ster-@@ ri@@ dden st. peter@@ sburg .
but it is not immediately obvious whether it is schro@@ eder li@@ cking pu@@ tin ’ s boots nowadays or vice versa .
the two of them are building , or trying to build , the nord stream gas pipeline , an excep@@ tionally costly project that satis@@ fies twin strategic obje@@ ctives .
demon@@ stra@@ tively hostile to the interests of both bel@@ ar@@ us and ukra@@ ine , the pipeline is intended to ensure that these countries are under russia ’ s energy thumb , regardless of who is in power in min@@ sk and kie@@ v .
as a bonus , the pipeline will also con@@ soli@@ date the russian economy ’ s status as an app@@ en@@ da@@ ge of germany ’ s – its supp@@ lier of natural resources .
certain of schro@@ eder ’ s pre@@ de@@ cess@@ ors as german chan@@ cell@@ or sought to at@@ tain the same objective by rather different means .
the kre@@ m@@ lin ’ s achievements in se@@ cur@@ ing the help of americans willing to offer their influence are equally impressive .
indeed , the obama administration ’ s russia policy is being nur@@ tured with advice from people who have no official position in the administration but close business ties to russia and the kre@@ m@@ lin : henry kis@@ singer , james a. baker , thomas graham , and dimitri si@@ mes .
the first two are major geo-@@ politicians ; graham and si@@ mes are respected as out@@ standing russia specialists .
they write key reports for the administration , and shuttle between moscow and washington , coordin@@ ating the parameters of the obama administration ’ s effort to “ res@@ et ” the bil@@ ateral relationship .
like schro@@ eder , all these people are not economically dis@@ interested .
baker is a consul@@ tant for the two companies at the command@@ ing heights of the russian economy , ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m and ros@@ ne@@ ft .
the kis@@ singer associ@@ ates lo@@ bb@@ ying group , whose russian section is headed by graham , feeds in to the kis@@ sing@@ er-@@ pri@@ ma@@ ko@@ v working group , a qu@@ asi@@ -@@ privat@@ e-@@ sector effort , blessed by pu@@ tin , to deep@@ en ties between russia and the united states .
it is highly instruc@@ tive to read the recommen@@ dations of these people and groups , as they un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sively render the obje@@ ctives of their kre@@ m@@ lin clients into a language familiar to american leaders .
graham ’ s latest contribution , “ resur@@ gent russia and us purposes , ” is most revealing in this respect .
the author finds the government of a “ russia getting up off its knees ” to con@@ s@@ ist of progressive moderni@@ zers fully aware of the challenges facing their country as it attempts to “ return to the great powers club . ”
“ in order to become a genuinely developed and modern country , ” graham continues , “ in the coming decade russia will need to invest at least one trillion dollars in moderni@@ zing its infrastructure .
america and the west in general have a vital interest in seeing the moderni@@ zation of russia succeed .
the lion &apos;s share of the technologies , know-how , and a substantial proportion of the investment , needs to come from europe and the usa . ”
in addition to the technology and investments , graham quietly sli@@ ps in a foreign policy suggestion for the obama administration that is sure to please the kre@@ m@@ lin : “ fin@@ lan@@ di@@ zing ” ukra@@ ine .
unless that sort of appe@@ as@@ ement is pursu@@ ed , he war@@ ns , russia will continue to op@@ pose the us “ wherever and whenever it can . ” according to graham , “ at the extreme , a weak russia , with its vast resources and spar@@ se population east of the ur@@ als , could become the object of competition among the great powers , not@@ ably china and the united states . ”
that uns@@ po@@ ken hel@@ p-@@ us-@@ develop@@ -@@ or-@@ we ’ ll@@ -@@ le@@ t-@@ the-@@ chines@@ e-@@ do-@@ it threat is a logical development of prime minister pu@@ tin ’ s hom@@ ily at this year ’ s world economic forum in da@@ vos , where he advoc@@ ated decisi@@ ve action to end the world economic crisis .
his recipe ?
western countries should write off half a trillion dollars ’ worth of debt o@@ wed to them by the russian state corporations run by his p@@ als from the d@@ res@@ den k@@ gb and the o@@ zero dach@@ a cooperative .
but no amount of money will succeed in moderni@@ zing pu@@ tin &apos;s kle@@ pto@@ cratic regime , which has already squ@@ ander@@ ed trilli@@ ons in oil wealth .
simply put , the pu@@ tin system is politically , institution@@ ally , and intellec@@ tually anti@@ the@@ tical to the task of moderni@@ zation .
graham ’ s only error in his presentation is his attempt to fri@@ gh@@ ten the administration with a hypothetical confron@@ tation between the us and china over russian resources .
this is not his area of specialization .
kis@@ singer works personally with the chinese account , jo@@ in@@ tly pro@@ po@@ unding with his long-@@ time ri@@ val z@@ big@@ nie@@ w br@@ ze@@ zin@@ ski the notion , so se@@ duc@@ tive for an america growing we@@ ary of its imperial burden , of a global big two .
here is a recent sample of kis@@ singer ’ s geo@@ political arts : “ the role of china in a new world order is crucial .
a relationship that started on both sides as essentially a strategic design to constra@@ in a common ad@@ versary has evolved over the decades into a pill@@ ar of the international system ... the sin@@ o-@@ american relationship needs to be taken to a new level .
this generation of leaders has the opportunity to shape relations into a design for a common destiny , much as was done with trans@@ -@@ atlantic relations in the post-@@ war period . ”
no doubt kis@@ singer believes every word he wrote , but his ideas also honestly articulate the aspirations of his customers .
one wants to get his hoo@@ ks into a further trillion dollars that it can pick away at , while the other wants to become “ a central construct of the system of international relations . ”
but , in both cases , the customers are getting the influence for which they are paying .
who threat@@ ens our identity ?
pra@@ gue : identity and sovereig@@ n@@ ty are often discussed nowadays .
but what do they actually mean ?
both probably con@@ s@@ ist of feelings that a community can only be its true self when it can be so without hin@@ dr@@ ance – in essence , when a community can decide its own fate .
today ’ s talk about identity and sovereig@@ n@@ ty is often rather glo@@ omy .
some of these concerns may contain a rational core .
yet they all deri@@ ve from a traditional mis@@ conception – the belief that uph@@ olding character , identity or sovereig@@ n@@ ty is not princi@@ p@@ ally the task of a community or a people but is something left in the control of others ; that is , left to those who would attempt to depri@@ ve “ us ” of our identity , or at least to wea@@ ken it .
i do not think , however , that the world ’ s main concern is to find ways to rob people of their identity and sovereig@@ n@@ ty .
respect for any nation ’ s unique character ; the manner of its development ; and , the degree to which a community decides its fate , is determined primarily by those living within it .
how is this fate determined ?
it depends on whether a people close themselves off in hope that the various winds of this world will pass them by ; or , whether a nation takes the opposite t@@ ack and condu@@ cts itself as true inhabit@@ ants of this continent and of this planet , that is , as people engaged with the world and who assume their share of responsibility for it .
all humanity is faced by this crucial dilemma : to sil@@ ently watch a sui@@ ci@@ dal self-@@ propulsion of our civilization ; or to become active participants in the maintenance of global public assets , including the most precious one of all – our planet and its biosphere – of which we are a part .
but the concept of community is also composed of concrete things .
it depends , for example , on whether the environment is nur@@ tured .
it depends on whether a people let their cities and towns become mar@@ red by a banal universal architecture devo@@ id of creativity and imagination .
such bli@@ ghts are not imposed by the european union or by global capital with its transnational corporations , or by evil foreig@@ ners .
all of this physical degradation – as it happens – is accomplished with local consent and active local assistance .
in other words : those who defi@@ le “ our ” identity are primarily ourselves – we who should be its prote@@ ctors and guar@@ di@@ ans .
who is it that infe@@ sts language and conversation with c@@ liches , ill-@@ structured syn@@ tax and rote expressions that flow mind@@ lessly from mouth to mouth and pen to pen ?
who is responsible for the sterile language of commercials seen on every wall and television , indeed , seen everywhere , and without which we appear to be unable to know even the time of day ?
aren ’ t these severe attacks on language also assau@@ l@@ ts on a root of our identities ?
and aren ’ t we who use them , quite will@@ ingly , also responsible for them ?
let us go farther : who allows young people to ba@@ the from morning till night in blood flowing on television and movie screens , and yet are sanc@@ ti@@ mon@@ i@@ ous and aston@@ ished about the aggressi@@ veness of the young ?
who reads all kinds of trash and por@@ no-@@ trash ?
these “ enter@@ tain@@ ments ” are not filmed and published by bureau@@ crats from brus@@ sels or by representatives of international institutions , foreign states or large international corporations : they are market@@ ed by citizens to fellow citizens .
behind these visible assau@@ l@@ ts on identity found in every industrial country , the post@@ communist countries confront other serious threats to both sovereig@@ n@@ ty and identity .
over the past ten years of economic transformation , unimaginable wealth has un@@ accoun@@ tably disappeared from banks and companies ; billions in taxes go un@@ paid .
perhaps worst of all , those who transferred money to tax ha@@ vens seem to enjoy the silent admi@@ ration of the people of whom they have taken advantage .
but who , precisely , are those who do not re@@ pay their deb@@ ts , and who are those who hire ass@@ ass@@ ins to get rid of their credi@@ tors ?
who , among those who should be serving as models for others , that is , who among the leaders of political parties , den@@ ies his own financial machin@@ ations with a s@@ mir@@ k ?
who em@@ its into our political and public life the pois@@ ons of dis@@ sen@@ sion , f@@ oul play , ego@@ ism , hatred and envy ?
who – quite in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ously – is leading us to become ever more har@@ den@@ ed in our sensi@@ bilities and toward becoming increasingly ac@@ custom@@ ed to the fact that everyone can lie about everything and anything ?
i repeat : if a nation &apos;s identity is je@@ opar@@ di@@ zed , it is placed in that position primarily from within ; it is placed in je@@ opar@@ dy by choice – often the choices expressed at the bal@@ lot box – and out of ne@@ gli@@ gence or in@@ dol@@ ence .
threats to identity nowadays are primarily not matters of dictat@@ es from outside .
true , the blind pursuit of profit is not the invention of any one people .
true , that pursuit is a trait which is immensely contagious .
but it is also true that nobody can force anyone to take that course .
if we really want it , if we all are prepared to express the desire to preserve community and identity by taking part in elections and by making the right choices , an open international environment and the advanced democratic cultures of our neighbors , friends and allies constit@@ utes the best ground for advan@@ cing a people ’ s uniqu@@ eness .
nowadays , any identity can truly live and flourish only if it brea@@ thes the free air of the world ; if it defines itself against a background of lasting and living neighbor@@ ly relations with other identities ; and , if it confron@@ ts , in a dig@@ ni@@ fied manner , both the ad@@ verse winds that blow across today ’ s world and , perhaps more importantly , the ad@@ verse desires that come from within .
who wants cold war ii ?
to@@ le@@ do , spain – does the war in the cau@@ cas@@ us her@@ ald the coming of cold war ii ?
or is it a russian invitation to the west to res@@ ha@@ pe the global status quo that has prevail@@ ed since the end of cold war i ?
russia ’ s military is certainly not fit for a global confron@@ tation with the west .
not only did russian intelligence fail to catch the coming geor@@ gian attack on south os@@ se@@ tia , but russia ’ s electronic warfare system and ill-@@ equipped ground troops looked like out@@ dated so@@ viet@@ -@@ era reli@@ cs .
then again , a war does not have to display state-of-the-art weapon@@ ry to convey a powerful political message .
after all , america ’ s global leverage is d@@ wind@@ ling even as its army remains the most sophisticated military machine in history .
by showing that the united states has lost its monopoly on the un@@ il@@ ateral use of force , and by inv@@ ading an american ally – which even the soviet union never dar@@ ed – russia blat@@ antly challenged the pa@@ x americ@@ ana that emerged from the us victory in the cold war .
the war in georgia could not have happened if america had not mis@@ hand@@ led its global he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y so disa@@ str@@ ously .
the us entered a cal@@ amit@@ ous war in iraq , missed more than one opportunity to engage iran &apos;s revolutionary regime , pushed for un@@ ending expansion of nato onto the door@@ step of russia , and hau@@ gh@@ ti@@ ly ignored russia ’ s prote@@ sts against the deplo@@ yment of missile defen@@ ses in eastern europe .
under the cover of the “ war on terror , ” the us played into russia ’ s fear of en@@ cir@@ cle@@ ment through its military penet@@ ration into central asian countries such as afghanistan , pakistan , u@@ z@@ be@@ ki@@ stan , ky@@ r@@ gy@@ z@@ stan , ka@@ z@@ ak@@ h@@ stan , and ta@@ ji@@ ki@@ stan .
in its quest to counter what it sees as a hostile us strategy of creating american “ cu@@ b@@ as ” on its door@@ step , the kre@@ m@@ lin is promoting alli@@ ances with ra@@ ú@@ l ca@@ stro ’ s cuba and hu@@ go ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z ’ s venezuela .
in the middle east , russia is doing everything to regain some of the fo@@ oth@@ olds it had in the past with the aim of si@@ del@@ ining america as the sole global actor in the region .
sy@@ rian president bas@@ har al-@@ as@@ sad ’ s recent visit to moscow is a transparent manifestation of the potential for a rene@@ wed alliance .
russia continues to place hur@@ d@@ les before american pro@@ pos@@ als for san@@ ctions on iran , has signed with it la@@ vis@@ h energy contracts , and is about to sell it advanced aerial systems aimed at th@@ war@@ ting a possible israeli or american attack .
likewise , the russians have just er@@ ased much of iraq ’ s debt and agreed lu@@ cra@@ tive oil drilling deals .
one victim of american post-@@ cold war un@@ il@@ ater@@ alism has been the trans@@ atlantic alliance .
the us drive to expand nato is not shared by all its allies , and europe is in no mood to follow in the foot@@ steps of georgia ’ s impul@@ sive president and be dragged by the ex-@@ soviet bal@@ tic states and poland into a confron@@ tation with russia .
europe , dependent as it is on russian energy supplies , is not prepared for a new cold war , and its alternative to russian oil – iran – is not pal@@ at@@ able to the americans .
a return to a cold war strategy is clearly not in the west ’ s interest .
threats to expe@@ l russia from the g-@@ 8 or keep it out of the world trade organization will only increase its sense of isolation , streng@@ then its author@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , and push it into the role of a revolutionary anti-@@ status quo power in the soviet union ’ s old sphere of influence and beyond .
russian min@@ orities still waiting to be “ rede@@ em@@ ed ” in ukra@@ ine , the bal@@ tic states , and mol@@ do@@ va are potential triggers for russia ’ s neo-@@ imperi@@ alism .
but , as a power bur@@ den@@ ed with too many domestic ills and a chronic sense of inse@@ curity along its vast and danger@@ ously de@@ populated borders , russia cannot be interested in a cold war ii , either .
its recent agreement with china on border de@@ mar@@ cation not@@ with@@ standing , russia can never be assu@@ red of china ’ s ultimate intentions as a colo@@ s@@ sal power hungry for raw materials for its boom@@ ing economy and living space for its massive population .
as the war in the cau@@ cas@@ us has shown , the global economy does not offer a fool@@ proof guarantee against war .
but it is one thing to take a calculated risk , as the russians did in rightly assuming that the west would not go to war over georgia ; it is another thing for russia to je@@ opar@@ di@@ ze its colo@@ s@@ sal economic gains of recent years in an all-@@ out confron@@ tation with the west .
indeed , the war in georgia already has thrown russia into the most severe financial crisis since its virtual bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy in 1998 ; $ 17 billion were lost in capital flight in just one week .
the moscow stock exchange lost 15 % of its value in august , and russia ’ s central bank fore@@ ca@@ sts a 25 % decline in foreign investment this year .
russia must seek genuine strategic partnership with the us , and the lat@@ ter must understand that , when exclu@@ ded and des@@ pis@@ ed , russia can be a major global spo@@ iler .
ignored and humili@@ ated by the us since the cold war ended , russia needs integration into a new global order that respects its interests as a resur@@ gent power , not an anti-@@ western strategy of confron@@ tation .
who wants peace in the middle east ?
for@@ ty years after the six day war peace between israelis and palestini@@ ans seems as distant as ever .
israel still ref@@ uses to accept the new palestinian national unity government as a negotiating partner because hamas is part of that government .
what is the cause of this seem@@ ing paradox ?
is there any hope ?
the palestinian government is united administra@@ tively , but divided politically .
the palestini@@ ans have one government with two policies .
politically , palestine ’ s prime minister is@@ mail h@@ ani@@ ye@@ h remains against recognizing israel and respe@@ cting the existing agre@@ ements .
he declared that he is for the continu@@ ation of resistance in all forms .
what kind of guarantee of a good faith effort to reach a peace agreement can come from such a stance ?
that is the question the european union needs to ask itself as it deb@@ ates whether to res@@ u@@ me providing financial aid to the palestinian authority .
the eu should make it clear to hamas that the union is not going to finance terror and is not going to finance a ref@@ us@@ al to make peace .
if the palestini@@ ans want to have european help – which i support completely – it must be ready to make peace , not to break peace .
after all , it is not hamas as a party that is obje@@ c@@ tion@@ able ; what is obje@@ c@@ tion@@ able are the politics and policies which hamas pursu@@ es .
we have nothing against hamas ; we are against their bel@@ li@@ ger@@ ent policies , which service in government has not changed .
then the pl@@ o changed .
if the current palestinian leadership changes its position , there will be no problem from our side .
we will have nothing against negotiations .
we are for negotiations .
we are for the “ two-@@ state solution . ”
we accept the middle east “ road map . ”
what we are against is terror .
where we cannot agree , however , is on a “ right of return ” for palestini@@ ans .
if such a right were recognized , there would be a palestinian majority instead of a jewish majority , which would mean the end of the jewish state .
this is a demographic , not a religious , question : an arab state is where the arab@@ s are the majority , and the jewish state is where the jews are the majority .
indeed , the “ right of return ” contradi@@ cts the very idea of a two-@@ state solution , as it would mean one state – a palestinian state .
nobody in israel will accept this .
but there are other problems in the region that israel – and the world – must face .
the palestini@@ ans ’ current unity government resulted from saudi medi@@ ation , which came in response mainly to iran ’ s ambition to increase its influence , not only in iraq , but also in lebanon , gaza , and the west bank .
of course , that issue is completely outside israel ’ s control .
the ongoing fight in the muslim world between sun@@ nis and shi ’ a rec@@ alls the struggle between prote@@ stan@@ ts and catho@@ lic@@ s in sevent@@ e@@ enth@@ -@@ century europe .
so it is little wonder that the sau@@ dis , jordan@@ ians , egyptians , and the gulf states are seeking to resist iran ’ s he@@ ge@@ mon@@ ic ambi@@ tions in the region .
nevertheless , the stakes are far higher than in the sevent@@ e@@ enth century , because iran represents a threat that combin@@ es a fana@@ tic religion with a determination to acquire nuclear weapons .
indeed , iran is the only country that open@@ ly declar@@ es its desire to destroy another member of the united nations .
that is a threat that every country is obli@@ ged to take seriously .
when a country ’ s president delivers crazy speeches , den@@ ies the holocaust , and does not hide his ambition to control the middle east , who can guarantee that the threat is not serious ?
the issue is not one of restor@@ ing nuclear “ balance ” to the middle east , as iran ’ s leaders maintain .
israel never said that it wants to destroy iran ; israel never open@@ ly pro@@ cla@@ imed that it would en@@ rich uranium and build nuclear bombs in order to destroy another country .
on the contrary , israel has said that it will not be the first to use nuclear weapons in the middle east .
but that does not mean that we can afford to ignore an obvious threat from countries that want to destroy us .
despite the current un@@ favor@@ able situation , the path to stabili@@ zing the middle east still leads through joint economic projects .
even now , israel is planning to build a new “ corrid@@ or of peace , ” which will com@@ prise the jordan@@ ians , the palestini@@ ans , and us .
within the framework of this project , we are seeking to halt the de@@ hydra@@ tion of the dead sea , build a joint airport and a joint water network with jordan , and develop tourism infrastructure , at a cost of up to $ 5 billion .
we have the donors , so there is no shortage of money to finance our efforts , which , i am sure , will be realized .
israel wants – indeed , desperately needs – peace and stability in the middle east , and we will continue to do everything in our power to achieve it .
but we cannot reach that goal alone , much less negotiate with those whose idea of a stable and peaceful middle east is one that has no place for israel .
washington , dc – according to vol@@ ta@@ ire , the roman empire fell “ because all things fall . ”
it is hard to argue with this as a general statement about decline : nothing lasts forever .
but it is also not very useful .
in thinking , for example , about american pre@@ dominance in the world today , it would be nice to know when it will decline , and whether the united states can do anything to post@@ pone the inevitable .
contemporary commen@@ ters des@@ paired of the roman empire for several hundred years before it finally collapsed .
could america find its way to a similar extension ?
in terms of providing an essential structure for discussion of this problem , ar@@ v@@ ind su@@ bra@@ manian ’ s new book , ec@@ lip@@ se : living in the shadow of china ’ s economic dominance , is a major contribution .
( full dis@@ closure : su@@ bra@@ manian and i are colleagues at the peter@@ son institute for international economics , and we have worked together on other issues . )
in particular , su@@ bra@@ manian develops an index of economic dominance that should become a focus of conversation anywhere that people want to think about changes in world economic leadership .
there is no need to know any economics in order to be fascinated by this book : it is about power , pure and simple .
the basic facts are in@@ contro@@ verti@@ ble .
the united kingdom was the world ’ s dominant economic power from the rise of industri@@ alization in the early n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth century .
but it lost its pre@@ dominance and was gradually ec@@ lip@@ sed by the us , which , at least since 1945 , has been the un@@ dispu@@ ted leader among market@@ -based economies .
the us sur@@ passed the uk in terms of industrial production as early as the end of the n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth century , but that was not enough to tip the balance .
economic pre@@ dominance shifted only when the uk ran large curr@@ ent-@@ account defic@@ its during world wars i and ii – the country had to borrow heavily in order to finance its war effort , and impor@@ ts were significantly higher than exports .
much of the world ’ s gold reserves ended up in the hands of the us .
this helped under@@ mine the role of the british pound internation@@ ally and cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted the us dollar to the fore – particularly after the brett@@ on woods conference in 194@@ 4 , at which it was agreed that countries would hold their reserves in dollars as well as gold .
more recently , however , it has been the americans ’ turn consistently to run large curr@@ ent-@@ account defic@@ its , buying more from the rest of the world than they earn by selling goods and services abroad .
on this dimension , the us seems destined to repeat the mistake of the british .
at the same time , emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market countries ’ per capita income has ris@@ en – as has their international role .
in particular , china has followed a strategy in the past decade or so that ent@@ a@@ ils running large curr@@ ent-@@ account sur@@ pl@@ uses and building up foreig@@ n-@@ exchange reserves , which are now reported to be in excess of $ 3 trillion .
indeed , su@@ bra@@ manian ’ s most provo@@ cative argument is that china has already sur@@ passed the us in terms of economic dominance – but we have not yet wo@@ ken up to this new reality .
the story is fascinating and well told ; but there is still a great deal worth arguing .
for example , did the british decline because the us could not be stopped , or because of problems within the british empire and at home ?
a few years ago , some regarded japan as having over@@ taken the us .
europe also was supposedly v@@ ying for global economic dominance .
now any such claims would seem pre@@ po@@ ster@@ ous .
in both cases , the credit system got out of control , with too much len@@ ding to the private sector in 1980 ’ s japan and exc@@ essive government borrowing during the 2000 ’ s in the euro@@ zone .
similarly , it remains unclear that the chinese development path will remain smooth .
fixed investment in china is close to 50 % of gdp – which must be a world record .
credit to state firms and to households continues to grow rapidly .
isn ’ t this a version of exactly what der@@ a@@ iled japanese growth ?
on the key issue of being able to issue a “ reserve currency ” that investors and governments want to hold , su@@ bra@@ manian is correct that china has many of the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ites in place .
but it still lac@@ ks some key elements , including ful@@ ly-@@ fle@@ dged property rights .
if you worry about getting your money out of a country when times turn tough , china is not an attractive place to hold your reserves .
external challenges do sometimes bring down states .
but , more frequently , the big problems are internal – the regime cannot deliver growth , its legiti@@ macy fa@@ des , and people start to head for the ex@@ its ( or at least get their money out ) .
if the us is ec@@ lip@@ sed any time soon , this will more likely be due to its loss of social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on and its dys@@ functional politics .
china might well step in to fill that vacuum , but that is quite different from being able to elbow america aside .
who will help the poor ?
paris – with the dee@@ pen@@ ing of the economic crisis and the prospect of another recession lo@@ oming large on the horizon , growing social inequality has become an increasingly urgent issue .
how does one rein@@ force a sense of solidar@@ ity and responsibility within a country ?
who will protect the weak@@ est ?
as i pon@@ der this issue , i am reminded of a debate that i had more than ten years ago in berlin with the german the@@ ologi@@ an hans kün@@ g and american and asian participants .
the subject was “ globalization and ethics ” – specifically , a comparison of the ways that europe , the united states and asia protect the most fragile members of their respe@@ ctive societies .
all of the participants agreed that in europe the state traditionally filled the role played by private phil@@ an@@ tro@@ py in the us and by the family in asia .
but we all ha@@ sten@@ ed to add that no model was “ pure , ” i.@@ e. , the family was no longer what it used to be in asia , the state was playing a bigger role than expected in america , and it was often under@@ performing in europe .
so who will take on the responsibility to protect the weak@@ est if none of these three actors can do it properly ?
are we heading toward a world united by shared in@@ compe@@ tence and in@@ adequ@@ acy ?
in the western world , the poorest are the worst affected by economic stag@@ nation .
but , in rapidly growing emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market countries , the rich tend to close their eyes to the suffering of the poorest , except when they feel threatened by the risk of political up@@ hea@@ val , as in , say , saudi arabia .
in fact , wealthy elites in emerging countries live in a state of denial towards their poor , literally ignor@@ ing them .
brazil and india are particularly striking in this regard .
economic growth is necessary , but not sufficient : a strong sense of social responsibility is needed as well .
globalization is above all a context , an environment , even if the consequences of the first major financial and economic crisis of the global age will further deep@@ en the gap between the very rich and the very poor .
but globalization makes the weak@@ est among us more visible , and therefore makes the absence of social justice more unacceptable .
a world of much greater transparency and inter@@ dependen@@ cy creates new responsibilities for the rich .
or , more precisely , it makes the old responsibility to protect the weak@@ est both more difficult and more urgent .
in a world of increasing complexity , perhaps what is needed are simple solutions .
one could follow , for example , adam smith ’ s principle of compar@@ ative advantage : what europe does best is the state , while asia still reli@@ es on the family and the us continues to focus on individual initiative .
the problem is that in a world of universal bench@@ mar@@ king , the legiti@@ macy of solutions will stem more than ever from their cultural accep@@ tability and their efficiency .
in western europe , for example , the call for sacrifice from all citizens in order to resolve the debt crisis runs up against a ling@@ ering perception that not all will contribute equally , and that social inequality will be exac@@ erb@@ ated by au@@ ster@@ ity .
restor@@ ing growth in the short term while addressing debt problems in the medium and long term may well be the only valid response to the crisis .
but it will not work , in europe or elsewhere , without a much greater emphasis on social justice .
while some of the very rich complain , as warren buff@@ ett did recently , that they do not pay enough taxes , the enlightened generosity of these happy few – who want to save capitalism and liber@@ alism – is unlikely to be em@@ ulated by the new rich in the emerging countries , much less by the rich elsewhere .
let ’ s be realistic : people like buff@@ ett and bill gates have very few followers even among the very rich in the us .
and can asian societies really revi@@ ve an effective sense of family responsibility ?
globalization does appear to have weak@@ ened cultural differences notic@@ e@@ ably in the past decade .
but , when it comes to the protection of the weak@@ est and the struggle against rising social injustice , perhaps “ global de@@ cul@@ tu@@ ration ” creates an opportunity to combine the best of what remains in particular traditions .
perhaps countries should seek to base their soci@@ al-@@ welfare systems on a new synthesis of the state , the family , and philanthropy .
who will pay the price of en@@ lar@@ gement ?
london : the glow of optimism at the european union &apos;s hel@@ sin@@ ki summit last month , when eu leaders decided to extend mem@@ ber@@ ship negotiations to all ten candidate countries from central and eastern europe , plus mal@@ ta and c@@ yp@@ rus , is fa@@ ding fast .
it has now become crystal clear that en@@ lar@@ gement is going to be a very difficult process : difficult to negotiate , and just as difficult , perhaps , to sell to the voters .
the predi@@ cam@@ ent can be expressed in stark terms : who will pay the price of en@@ lar@@ gement ?
en@@ lar@@ gement will not be cost-@@ free : there will be los@@ ers , as well as winners .
but the common dilemma facing all sides in this negotiation , the ins as well as the outs , is to make sure that there are not too many los@@ ers in any one country .
otherwise , en@@ lar@@ gement simply will not get past the voters .
the most immediate manifestation of this predi@@ cam@@ ent is the european union &apos;s common agricultural policy .
this policy has long been a burden , both on eu consumers , because it has kept food prices high , and on eu taxpa@@ yers , because the subsi@@ dy to farmers &apos; incomes costs the union some e ( euro ) 4@@ 1@@ b@@ n every year ( about $ 40@@ b@@ n ) , or around half of the total eu budget .
but it has been part of the core bar@@ gain which has kept the union together .
on purely economic grounds , subsi@@ dis@@ ing eu farmers has no justi@@ fication , and it is an increasing anom@@ aly in a world of global markets and international competition .
at the start of the common market , it was the political price insisted on by france , a major agricultural country , as the condition for opening the french market to german industrial goods .
today , that bar@@ gain has lost most of its original justi@@ fication .
france is now an immensely rich and powerful industrial country ; and though it is still one of the world &apos;s great food producers , its farm population has shri@@ v@@ elled from around 30 % of the total population after world war ii to around 5 % today .
most eu governments , including the french , now reco@@ gn@@ ise that the cap must be re@@ formed , if only because of international pressure from other food-@@ expor@@ ting countries .
and in recent years , the eu has at least started to reduce the market support prices of some foods , while comp@@ ens@@ ating farmers by making direct income supp@@ lement payments instead .
the trouble is that the candidate countries now seeking mem@@ ber@@ ship are keen to get their share of the cap gra@@ vy .
the six front-@@ running countries ( c@@ ze@@ ch republic , est@@ onia , hung@@ ary , poland , slo@@ ven@@ ia and c@@ yp@@ rus ) recently submitted position papers to the eu demanding that their farm sectors should participate fully in the cap from day 1 , and that their farmers should get all the benefits , including income support payments .
it is not clear that this opening position is wise , in economic terms .
one social justi@@ fication for the cap is to prevent too large a gap between rural and industrial incomes in the existing eu .
but all incomes in the candidate countries are much lower than those in the eu , and if eu mem@@ ber@@ ship were to give a sudden upward sho@@ ve to rural incomes in central europe , it could be quite dest@@ abili@@ sing for social relations there .
moreover , it might also seriously dist@@ ort economic development , by attra@@ cting exc@@ essive investment into agriculture .
nor is it clear that this opening position is p@@ ru@@ dent in negotiating terms .
if all the benefits of the cap were paid in full in all the six front run@@ ners , the cost to the eu budget could be an extra e@@ 6@@ b@@ n a year , and virtually all of that would have to be paid by existing member states , because they are so much richer .
but they have made no pro@@ vision for this kind of spending , and are unlikely to agree to it .
one solution mo@@ oted by the commission as a way of fin@@ essing the problem is to have a long transition period between mem@@ ber@@ ship of the eu , and full participation in the cap .
but the position papers of the candidate countries explicitly rule out this del@@ a@@ ying tac@@ tic .
the farm policy puzzle will be followed by a similar predi@@ cam@@ ent over eu regional and social policies .
by definition these funds now go mainly to the poorer parts of the eu .
candidate countries , however , are poorer still , so the full application of these regional policies would call for large extra bud@@ ge@@ tary transfers to central and eastern europe .
at issue here is not mainly justice and morality .
of course , justice and morality come into it , and these emo@@ tive ban@@ ners will no doubt be wa@@ ved by candidate countries during the negotiations .
but these are not likely to be the decisi@@ ve consider@@ ations .
the first decisi@@ ve consideration will be the operational feasi@@ bility of the negotiation process , which means striking a politically acceptable balance between winners and los@@ ers throughout the en@@ lar@@ ged union .
it is difficult to over-@@ state what a difficult task that may turn out to be . remember , it only needs the voters of one member state to say no , and the whole process fails .
the second consideration is the future architecture of the en@@ lar@@ ged eu .
post@@ po@@ ning access to the cap may seem a partial solution to this problem ; but it is also a partial step towards creating a two-@@ tier union .
given the immense dispar@@ ities in economic and other development , between the eu and the candidate countries , it may be debat@@ able whether it will be possible to create a un@@ it@@ ary or one-@@ tier union with 2@@ 7-@@ plus countries .
but if not , what will be the architecture of this en@@ lar@@ ged eu ?
unfortunately , this is a question which the member states have not thought about , and apparently do not wish to think about .
who will run the world ?
singapore – barack obama ’ s election comes at a moment when a new bit of conventional wisdom is con@@ ge@@ aling .
it concerns the end of america ’ s global dominance .
and america ’ s military super@@ i@@ ority has not proved all that useful in accompli@@ shing american ends .
but who may pick up the sl@@ ack in providing global leadership ?
the uncomfortable answer that obama is likely to confront is this : nobody .
america may be damaged , but no replacement is on offer .
europe is self-@@ absorbed , focused on creating whatever kind of entity it ends up deciding to be .
china ’ s standard response to any suggestion that it exercise global leadership is to hide beneath its vast internal agenda and ple@@ ad poverty .
no other country comes close to having either the capacity or the ambition .
in the face of the familiar lit@@ any of desperate global problems – not just financial inst@@ ability , but also climate change , energy inse@@ curity , potential pande@@ mics , terrorism , and the spread of weapons of mass destruction – the prospect of a ru@@ d@@ der@@ less world is more than alarming .
what is to be done ?
and by whom ?
given that the united states has not been playing much of a leadership role on many of these issues recently , it is worth taking a look at what happens when no one country exercis@@ es effective leadership .
one set of answers might seem apparent from the collapse of international trade negotiations and the un@@ ra@@ veling international system to control the spread of nuclear weapons . things can certainly get grim .
but that is not the whole story .
to see why , consider climate change .
it is now clear that avoiding catastrophic climate change requires dramatic and rapid reduc@@ tions in green@@ house@@ -@@ gas emissions , cuts that would lower annual emissions to 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050 .
yet emissions are not just rising , but accelerating .
the coming recession may stem their growth tempor@@ arily , but only slightly .
the necessary reduc@@ tions imp@@ ly a rapid and radical transformation of industrial , energy , and land@@ -@@ use systems around the world .
what are governments doing about this ?
supposedly , by december 2009 they will agree on a new treaty to set limits on emissions .
but the pro@@ spe@@ cts that an agreement will be reached in copenhagen in december 2009 are close to ni@@ l .
the new obama administration will have only a few months to develop meaningful pro@@ pos@@ als that can win domestic support , and will be pre@@ occupied with the after@@ math of the current financial de@@ bac@@ le and the iraq war .
europe is pushing for ambitious targets but is having trouble with its own vest@@ ed interests .
the large emerging countries , although they will suffer dis@@ proportion@@ ately from wil@@ der weather and rising sea levels , show little interest in picking up the sl@@ ack .
in short , the process is a mess .
this is hardly surprising .
an inter-@@ governmental system that falls apart under the challenges of trade negotiations and proliferation threats is unlikely to master the deep complexity and multi@@ tu@@ din@@ ous vest@@ ed interests that the issue of climate change ent@@ a@@ ils .
traditional diplomacy will at best dev@@ ise a face-@@ saving but meaningless accor@@ d next year .
in many areas , frustration with inter-@@ governmental in@@ transi@@ gence and in@@ compe@@ tence has spar@@ ked extraordinary innovation by non-@@ governmental organizations , corporations , and ordinary people .
private organizations such as the forest stewardship council and the marine stewardship council provide and , increasingly , implement environmental standards where inter-@@ governmental action has failed .
private actors from foundations to pharmaceutical corporations to ngos are actively experimenting with alternative ways to tackle transnational health challenges .
often governments are part of these experiments – but they are not necessarily the drivers , and progress does not depend on signing treaties .
indeed , there are many ways to put matters on the global agenda , as shown by bono ’ s campaigns on african development and al gore ’ s on climate change .
agre@@ ements about how to make things better already frequently include ngos and corporations in various capacities – and sometimes exclu@@ de governments altogether .
private groups using everything from satellite imagery ( as in fore@@ stry ) to the un@@ official equivalent of on-@@ site in@@ spe@@ ctions ( as in human rights ) monitor who is ab@@ i@@ ding by – or viol@@ ating – what standard of behavior .
while en@@ for@@ cement in the co@@ er@@ ci@@ ve sense remains the domain of states , co@@ er@@ ci@@ ve en@@ for@@ cement is rare even when it comes to inter-@@ governmental agre@@ ements .
whether countries ab@@ ide by agre@@ ements has far more to do with international processes of persu@@ asion , soci@@ alization , and capac@@ ity-@@ building – and those can be done by anyone with a good argument .
the big question today is whether all these alternative approaches can add up to more than a bit of desperate tinkering around the edges .
standard internation@@ al-@@ relations thinking does not even enter@@ tain the question , and those conventional ways of seeing the world have blin@@ ded us to looking at this crucial question .
as a result , we do not yet know the answer .
data remain scarce .
there are hundreds of global publi@@ c-@@ private partnerships working on various global ills – but few have been examined to see what good they do .
the mis@@ h@@ mash of initi@@ atives , actors , campaigns , and appe@@ als creates opportunities for major progress – and mass con@@ fusion .
if there is to be real progress toward more effective and efficient global governance that can address the unprecedented challenges posed by climate change and the rest of the global agenda , we must do much more than look for an easy replacement for american he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y .
we must figure out how to make sense of this enormous diversity of ways of saving the world .
who will speak for the larger europe ?
the top priority for the european union at the beginning of the twenty first century must be the historic project conce@@ aled beneath the rather boring label of ‘ en@@ lar@@ gement ’ .
the prize is something that has never been achieved in european history : the building of a liberal order that embra@@ ces the whole continent .
to press on with this is now more vital than ever - and more difficult .
it is more difficult because public opinion in core countries of the union , especially germany and france , and in leading applic@@ ant countries , such as poland and the c@@ ze@@ ch republic , is increasingly sc@@ ep@@ tical about the process .
the elec@@ toral success of j@@ ör@@ g hai@@ der in austria has shown how effectively popu@@ list politicians can exploit fears of opening to the east .
en@@ lar@@ gement now seems likely to be a con@@ ten@@ tious issue in the german parli@@ am@@ entary elections , and perhaps also the french presidential election , both due in 2002 .
and what plac@@ ates german and french voters may en@@ rage polish and c@@ ze@@ ch ones .
making the case for en@@ lar@@ gement is a challenge to democratic leadership in the whole of europe .
with his recent suggestion that germany should have a refer@@ end@@ um on en@@ lar@@ gement , gün@@ ter ver@@ heu@@ gen , the responsible european commission@@ er , has posed the right question and given the wrong answer .
the question is : why , over more than a decade since the fall of the berlin wall , have the political leaders of western europe made so little serious effect to convince their peoples that extending the european union to the newly liber@@ ated states of central , sou@@ th-@@ eastern and eastern europe is in those peoples ’ own vital , long-term interest ?
and how , bel@@ at@@ edly , can that now be done ?
however , refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms are not the answer .
we say this not because we don ’ t trust the people , but because refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms in representative democracies are instruments to be used very spar@@ ingly , on issues that directly affect the very core of national interests , institutions and identity .
that is why france had a refer@@ end@@ um on the ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht treaty , and denmark ( on 28 september ) and britain ( who knows when ? ) will have one on joining the euro@@ -@@ zone .
but en@@ lar@@ gement is not such an issue .
yes , it is vi@@ tally important for all our fu@@ tures .
but it does not directly imp@@ inge upon the vital interests of any eu nation .
contrary to what the scar@@ em@@ on@@ gers suggest , it will not result in a vast flood of immigr@@ ants , or the loss of tens of thousands of jobs , let alone any significant further loss of national sovereig@@ n@@ ty .
popu@@ lists dramati@@ se the short-term costs of en@@ lar@@ gement , while ignor@@ ing the long-term benefits .
the task for democratic leaders is to dramati@@ se the long-term benefits , while placing the short-term costs in an honest but accurate perspective .
we have nothing to fear from the facts .
public opinion on either side of the eu ’ s current eastern frontier - europe ’ s vel@@ vet cur@@ tain - has different concerns , but the two public opinions are also communicating vessels .
to the west , people fear immigration , job losses , and having to pay for en@@ lar@@ gement - either directly , in increased contributions to the eu budget , or indi@@ rectly , through subsidies that go , for example , to polish gali@@ cia rather than to spanish gali@@ cia .
ironically , the fear of ‘ inst@@ ability ’ to germany ’ s east - which nour@@ ished german support for eu en@@ lar@@ gement - has been reduced by poland , the c@@ ze@@ ch republic and hung@@ ary joining nato .
meanwhile , east central european markets are so open for west european expor@@ ters and investors that the western business@@ man can sel@@ fis@@ h@@ ly say ‘ why do i need en@@ lar@@ gement ? ’
to the east , there is dis@@ illusion@@ ment with what people see as the broken promises of west european leaders .
there is dis@@ may at the bureau@@ cratic rigi@@ dity and gigan@@ tism of the 80,000 pages of the ac@@ qu@@ is commun@@ au@@ ta@@ ire , which they have to adopt before being let in to the club .
they rightly consider many of these rules and regulations to be un@@ du@@ ly protective of special interests inside the eu and harmful to a dynamic free market economy .
there are , of course , the special worries of groups such as the polish farmers .
and there are broader concerns about giving up some of the sovereig@@ n@@ ty these countries have only recently re@@ gained .
there is also a real fear that the price for entering the paradise of schen@@ gen@@ land will be that they must make their own eastern frontiers for@@ ti@@ fied and im@@ penetr@@ able .
this is the last thing poland wants to do with ukra@@ ine , let alone the c@@ ze@@ ch republic with its former si@@ am@@ ese twin , slo@@ v@@ ak@@ ia , or hung@@ ary against its own hungarian minority in roman@@ ia .
one of the difficulties of making the case for en@@ lar@@ gement is that to sell it in germany or austria requires the as@@ sur@@ ance of closed , water@@ tight eastern borders , while to sell it in poland , hung@@ ary or the c@@ ze@@ ch republic needs the promise of soft , open ones .
if not a refer@@ end@@ um , then what is to be done ?
first and foremost , the eu must , at the latest during the swedish pres@@ iden@@ cy in the first half of 2001 , set a defini@@ te ti@@ me@@ table for the first round of en@@ lar@@ gement .
the fact that there was a bin@@ ding ti@@ me@@ table was one of the main reasons why economic and mon@@ etary union happened in january 1999 .
inspired by the re@@ collection of em@@ u ’ s two target dates , we suggest that eu leaders should say : ‘ the first round of en@@ lar@@ gement will happen , if all the conditions can be met in time , on 1 january 2003 .
it &#91; start it@@ al@@ ics &#93; must &#91; stop it@@ al@@ ics &#93; happen by 1 january 2005 . ’ and , incidentally , that first round must include poland , which is the most difficult but also the most important country in the leading group of appli@@ can@@ ts .
second , the european council in nice , this december , must , at long last , set a clear course for making those institutional reforms without which an eu of 20 and more member states will simply no longer function .
beside reforms of council and commission , there is a leap of principle to be made here .
the nice council should end@@ or@@ se the principle of ‘ enhanced cooperation ’ , so long as such cooperation is flexible , transparent and genuinely , at all stages , open to all member states who wish to join .
this op@@ pen@@ ness is a concern for the applic@@ ant countries too , who fear that otherwise they may be ‘ in ’ and yet still ‘ out ’ .
third , the eu should consider , in discussion with all european countries who wish to join it , whether there are not parts of its now complex structures of cooperation that some of them could join before becoming full members of the eu .
one example would be areas of the common foreign and security policy .
( after all , polish and c@@ ze@@ ch troops are already working beside british and italian ones to rebuild kosovo . )
another could be early acc@@ ession to the planned european charter of fundamental rights .
and it would surely be fitting if the pre@@ am@@ ble to that charter made explicit reference to the ideals of the central european revolutions of 1989 .
fourth , we have to consider how a european perspective can be made real to the politicians and publi@@ cs in the remot@@ er parts of sou@@ th-@@ eastern and eastern europe .
it is one of the iron@@ ies of the last decade that at the end of it west european troops and civil ser@@ van@@ ts are actually more present in bosnia and kosovo than they are in bo@@ he@@ mia or sil@@ es@@ ia .
the stepping stones from military prote@@ c@@ tor@@ ate to political integration have to be thought out - and then sp@@ elled out .
the eu ’ s recent message to the people of ser@@ bia and the other states of former yu@@ gosla@@ via is a good beginning , but more needs to be done .
and what have we to offer ukra@@ ine , and other countries to the east ?
finally , and more important than any of these individual steps , the leaders of europe have to take up the challenge and really start making the case for the larger europe to their publi@@ cs , east and west of the vel@@ vet cur@@ tain .
they need to be as serious about this as they have always been about the euro .
a weak euro may be a blessing in disgu@@ ise .
a weak europe is an un@@ mi@@ tig@@ ated cur@@ se .
but who among our leaders will step forward to take up this challenge ?
why america isn ’ t working
cambridge – as the us economy li@@ mps toward the second anniversary of the le@@ hman brothers bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy , ane@@ mic growth has left unemployment mi@@ red near 10 % , with little prospect of significant improvement anytime soon .
little wonder that , with mid-@@ term con@@ gressi@@ onal elections coming in november , americans are angri@@ ly asking why the government ’ s hyper-@@ aggressive stimulus policies have not turned things around .
what more , if anything , can be done ?
the honest answer – but one that few voters want to hear – is that there is no magic bullet .
it took more than a decade to dig today ’ s hole , and climbing out of it will take a while , too .
as carmen rein@@ hart and i war@@ ned in our 2009 book on the 80@@ 0-@@ year history of financial crises ( with the ironic title “ this time is different ” ) , slow , pro@@ tra@@ cted recovery with sustained high unemployment is the norm in the after@@ math of a deep financial crisis .
why is it so tough to boost employment rapidly after a financial crisis ?
one reason , of course , is that the financial system takes time to heal – and thus for credit to begin flowing properly again .
pump@@ ing vast taxpa@@ yer funds into financial be@@ he@@ mo@@ ths does not solve the deeper problem of de@@ fl@@ ating an over@@ lever@@ aged society .
americans bor@@ rowed and sh@@ opped until they were blue in the face , thinking that an ever-@@ rising housing price market would wash away all financial sins .
the rest of the world poured money into the us , making it seem as if life was one big free lunch .
even now , many americans believe that the simple solution to the nation ’ s problem is just to cut taxes and goo@@ se up private consumption .
cutting taxes is certainly not bad in principle , especially for supporting long-term investment and growth .
but there are several problems with the go@@ sp@@ el of lower taxes .
first , total publi@@ c-@@ sector debt ( including state and local debt ) is already ne@@ aring the 1@@ 19 % -@@ of-@@ gdp peak reached after world war ii .
some argue passionately that now is no time to worry about future debt problems , but , in my view , any realistic assessment of the medi@@ um-@@ term risks does not per@@ mit us simply to dis@@ miss such concerns .
a second problem with tax cuts is that they might well have only a limited impact on demand in the short run , with the private sector ho@@ ar@@ ding a significant share of the funds to repair badly over-@@ lever@@ aged balance sheets .
last but not least , there is a fairness issue .
by some measures , nearly half of all americans do not pay any income tax already , so cutting taxes ske@@ ws an already very unequal income distribution .
de@@ fer@@ red maintenance on income equality is one of many im@@ balances that built up in the us economy during the pre-@@ crisis boom .
if allowed to fester , the political consequences could be severe , including trade prote@@ c@@ tion@@ ism and perhaps even social un@@ rest .
those who think that the government should take up the sl@@ ack in private spending point out that there is an abundance of grow@@ th-@@ enhan@@ cing projects – a point that should be obvious to anyone familiar with america ’ s fra@@ ying infrastructure .
likewise , transfers to state and local governments , which have limited constitu@@ tional scope to borrow , would help slow down wr@@ en@@ ching la@@ yo@@ ffs of teachers , fire@@ fighters , and police .
lastly , extending unemployment insurance in the wake of a on@@ ce-@@ in-@@ a-@@ half-@@ century crisis should be a no-@@ brain@@ er .
but , unfortunately , ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian demand management is no pan@@ ac@@ e@@ a , either .
nor can the government always be the emplo@@ yer of last resort .
while tax cuts enhance long-term productivity , expanding the government sector is hardly a recipe for economic vi@@ tality .
there are surely many useful activities for the government to under@@ take in a market economy , but a fren@@ zi@@ ed or@@ gy of stimulus spending is not condu@@ ci@@ ve to rational discussion of what they should be .
and of course , there again is the matter of the so@@ aring national debt .
all in all , the g-@@ 20 ’ s policy of a@@ iming for gradu@@ al stabili@@ zation of growth in government debt , bringing it into line with nation@@ al-@@ income growth by 20@@ 16 , seems a reasonable approach to balancing short-term stimulus against lon@@ ger-@@ term financial risks , even at the cost of ling@@ ering unemployment .
while america is facing the limits of fiscal policy , mon@@ etary policy can do more , as federal reserve chair@@ man ben ber@@ nan@@ ke detailed in a recent speech in jackson hole , wy@@ oming .
with credit markets impaired , the fed could buy more government bonds or privat@@ e-@@ sector debt .
ber@@ nan@@ ke also not@@ ed the possibility of tempor@@ arily raising the fed ’ s medi@@ um-@@ term inflation target ( a policy that i suggested in this column in december 2008 ) .
given the massive dele@@ ver@@ aging of public@@ - and privat@@ e-@@ sector debt that lies ahead , and my continuing cy@@ nic@@ ism about the us political and legal system ’ s capacity to facili@@ tate work@@ outs , two or three years of slightly elevated inflation strikes me as the best of many very bad options , and far prefer@@ able to def@@ lation .
while the fed is still reluctant to compromise its long-term independence , i suspect that before this is over it will use most , if not all , of the tools out@@ lined by ber@@ nan@@ ke .
the bottom line is that americans will have to be patient for many years as the financial sector re@@ gains its health and the economy clim@@ bs slowly out of its hole .
the government can certainly help , but be@@ ware of pi@@ ed pi@@ pers tou@@ ting quick fix@@ es .
why america must not re-@@ ele@@ ct president bush
i have never been heavily involved in partisan politics , but these are not normal times .
president george w. bush is endanger@@ ing the united states and the world &apos;s safety while under@@ mining american values .
for op@@ posing him , i have been demon@@ ized by the bush campaign .
president bush ran in 2000 on a platform promising a &quot; humble &quot; foreign policy .
if re-@@ elected , the bush doctrine of pre@@ emp@@ tive action - and the invasion of iraq - will be end@@ or@@ sed , and the world will have to live with the consequences .
by repu@@ di@@ ating bush &apos;s policies at the polls , america will have a chance to regain the respect and support of the world .
the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , required a strong response .
but they also led to suspension of the critical process so essential to a democracy - a full and fair discussion of the issues .
for 18 months after 9 / 11 , he managed to suppress all dis@@ sent .
that is how he led america in the wrong direction .
in fact , bush played right into the hands of osama bin laden .
afghanistan &apos;s invasion was justi@@ fied : that was where bin laden lived and al qaeda had its training camps .
it was bush &apos;s unintended gift to bin laden .
immediately after 9 / 11 , there was a spontaneous out@@ pouring of sympathy for america worldwide .
it has given way to widespread res@@ ent@@ ment .
there are many more people willing to risk their lives to kill americans than there were on september 11 .
bush likes to insist that terrorists hate americans for what they are - a freedom loving people - not what they do .
but war and occupation create innocent victims .
we count the body bags of american soldiers - over 1,000 in iraq .
the wider world also counts the ira@@ q@@ is who get killed daily , perhaps 20 times more .
nor was the torture of deta@@ ine@@ es at abu ghraib prison the work of a few bad apples .
it was part of a system of dealing with prisoners put in place by defense secretary don@@ ald rum@@ s@@ feld .
public opinion con@@ dem@@ ns america worldwide , and our troops in iraq are paying the price .
bush convinced people that he is good for american security by playing on the fears generated by the 9 / 11 attacks .
at a time of per@@ il , people r@@ ally around the flag , and bush explo@@ ited this by fo@@ stering a sense of danger .
his campaign assumes that people do not really care about the truth and will believe almost anything if it is repeated often enough .
there must be something wrong with americans if we fall for it .
for instance , some 40 % of americans still believe that saddam hussein was connected with 9 / 11 , although the 9 / 11 commission - set up by bush and cha@@ ired by a republican - defini@@ tively established that no such connection existed .
i want to shout : &quot; wake up america .
don &apos;t you realize we are being mis@@ led ? &quot;
the war in iraq was mis@@ conceived from start to finish - if it has a finish .
it is a war of choice , not necessi@@ ty .
moreover , america went to war on false preten@@ ses . weapons of mass destruction could not be found , and the connection with al qaeda could not be established .
bush then cla@@ imed that america went to war to liber@@ ate iraq .
but democracy cannot be imposed by force .
saddam hussein was a ty@@ rant , and ira@@ q@@ is - and the world - can re@@ jo@@ ice in being rid of him .
but america had an obligation to maintain law and order ; instead , we stood i@@ dly by while bag@@ h@@ dad and other cities were r@@ ans@@ ac@@ ked .
if we had cared about the ira@@ qi people , we should have had more troops available for the occupation .
we should have provided protection not only for the oil ministry , but also other mini@@ stries , museums , and hospitals .
worse still , when american soldiers encountered resistance , they employed methods - inv@@ ading homes and mi@@ stre@@ ating prisoners - that ali@@ en@@ ated and humili@@ ated the population , generating res@@ ent@@ ment and rage .
the bush administration &apos;s fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ ps and mis@@ steps are legi@@ on .
first the ira@@ qi army was dis@@ solved , then america tried to re@@ constit@@ ute it .
first the us tried to eliminate the ba@@ ath@@ ists , then america turned to them for help .
when the insur@@ gency became intra@@ ctable , america installed an ira@@ qi government .
the man chosen to lead it was a prot@@ é@@ g@@ é of the cia with a reputation for being a stron@@ gman - a far cry from democracy .
despite the bush campaign &apos;s efforts at spin control , the situation in iraq is di@@ re .
much of the western part of the country has been ce@@ ded to insur@@ g@@ ents , the prospect of holding free and fair elections in january is fast re@@ ce@@ ding , civil war lo@@ oms .
bush &apos;s war in iraq has done un@@ told damage to america as well , im@@ pair@@ ing its military power and under@@ mining the mor@@ ale of the armed forces .
before the war , america could project overwhelming force .
not anymore .
afghanistan is sli@@ pping from control .
north korea , iran , pakistan , and other countries pursue nuclear programs with rene@@ wed vi@@ g@@ or .
the bush administration can be criticized for many other policies , but none are as important as iraq .
the war has cost nearly $ 200 billion , and costs will continue to mount , because getting into iraq was much easier than getting out will be .
bush has been ta@@ unting john kerry to explain how he would do things differently .
kerry has responded that he would have done everything differently , and that he would be in a better position to ex@@ tri@@ cate us .
but it won &apos;t be easy for him , either , because america is caught in a qu@@ ag@@ mi@@ re .
top military and diplo@@ matic experts desperately war@@ ned bush not to invade iraq .
he ignored them .
he supp@@ ressed the critical process , arguing that any criticism of the comman@@ der-@@ in-@@ chief puts us troops at risk .
but this is bush &apos;s war , and he ought to be held responsible for it .
americans should step back for a moment and ask : who got them into this mess ?
a moment &apos;s reflection should raise another question : does bush &apos;s texas swa@@ gger quali@@ fy him to remain america &apos;s comman@@ der-@@ in-@@ chief ?
why america must re@@ join the world
the terrorist attacks on new york and washington of september 11 , 2001 , profoundly changed the us , spa@@ wning a new focus on foreign policy .
the bush administration &apos;s new national security strategy , issued in september 2002 , identifi@@ es the combination of terrorism , ro@@ gue states , and weapons of mass destruction as the primary threat confron@@ ting america .
most people agree with the new focus of american foreign policy , but debate the means by which it is carried out .
is the threat so great that america must act alone , or should the us act only with the support of international institutions , even if that holds the country back ?
events in iraq illustrate this debate , but it has deeper roots .
in his 2000 election campaign , george w. bush said about america , &quot; if we are an arrogant nation , they &apos;ll view us that way , but if we &apos;re a humble nation , they &apos;ll respect us . &quot;
he was right , but unfortunately many of america &apos;s friends saw the first eight months of his administration as arrogan@@ tly concerned with narrow american interests , focused on military power , and dis@@ mis@@ sive of treaties , norms , and multi@@ lat@@ er@@ alism .
the administration &apos;s per@@ emp@@ tory announcement that the kyoto protocol on global climate change was &quot; dead &quot; contributed to a reaction from other countries that cost the us its seat on the un human rights commission .
september 11 th supposedly changed all that .
congress finally paid america &apos;s un du@@ es , and the president turned his efforts to building a coalition against terrorism .
but the rapid success of the war in afghanistan led some in the administration and some comm@@ ent@@ ators to conclude that un@@ il@@ ater@@ alism works .
the colum@@ n@@ ist charles kr@@ auth@@ am@@ mer , for example , urges a &quot; new un@@ il@@ ater@@ alism &quot; where america ref@@ uses to play the role of &quot; do@@ ci@@ le international citizen &quot; and un@@ ash@@ am@@ edly pursu@@ es its own ends .
the new un@@ il@@ ater@@ alists make a mistake in focusing too heavily on military power alone .
true , america &apos;s military power-@@ -@@ backed up by a budget equivalent to the next eight countries combined -@@ is essential to global stability , and an essential part of the response to terrorism .
but the metaphor of war should not blind us to the fact that supp@@ ressing terrorism will take years of patient , un@@ spectacular civilian cooperation with other countries in areas such as intelligence sharing , police work , tra@@ cing financial flows , and cooperation among cust@@ oms officials .
military success in afghanistan addressed the easiest part of the problem .
al qaeda re@@ tains cells in some fifty countries .
rather than proving the un@@ il@@ ater@@ alists &apos; point , the partial nature of the success in afghanistan illustrates the continuing need for cooperation .
similarly , it was much easier to win the war in iraq than to win the peace .
the problem for americans in the 21 st century is that more issues and forces than ever before are outside the control of even the most powerful state .
what the attacks of september 11 th demonstrated is that the information revolution and globalization , have changed world politics in a way that means americans cannot achieve all their international goals acting alone .
the us lac@@ ks both the international and domestic pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ites to resolve conflicts internal to other societies , and to monitor and control transnational trans@@ actions that threaten americans at home .
on many of today &apos;s key issues , such as international financial stability , drug smug@@ gling , the spread of diseases , or global climate change , military power is in@@ effective .
indeed , its use can be counter@@ productive .
america must instead mobili@@ ze international co@@ ali@@ tions to address these shared threats and challenges .
the willingness of others to cooperate depends in part on their own self-interest , but also on the attra@@ c@@ tiveness of american positions .
that power to attract is what i call &quot; soft power . &quot;
it means that others want what you want , and there is less need to use car@@ ro@@ ts and sticks to make others do what you want .
hard power grows out of a country &apos;s military and economic might .
soft power arises from the attra@@ c@@ tiveness of a country &apos;s culture , ideals , and policies .
hard power will always remain vital , but soft power will become increasingly important in dealing with transnational issues whose resolution requires multi@@ lat@@ eral cooperation .
to be sure , no large country can afford to be purely multi@@ lat@@ er@@ alist , and sometimes the us must take the lead , as it did in afghanistan .
but in iraq , president bush should have followed his father &apos;s example and built a broad international coalition .
now , as his administration returns to the un to seek a new resolution that will enable other countries to contribute troops and resources for peace@@ keeping and reconstruction in iraq , he is paying the price for the way he went to war .
granted , multi@@ lat@@ er@@ alism can be used by smaller states to restri@@ ct american freedom of action , but this does not mean that it is not generally in american interests .
by embed@@ ding us policies in multi@@ lat@@ eral frame@@ works , america can make its dis@@ proportion@@ ate power more legitimate and acceptable .
even well inten@@ tioned americans are not immune to lord ac@@ ton &apos;s famous warning that power tends to corrupt .
learning to listen to others and to define us interests broadly to include global interests will be crucial to american soft power and whether others see the american pre@@ pon@@ der@@ ance as benign or not .
the paradox of american power is that the largest power since rome cannot achieve many of its obje@@ ctives un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally in a global information age .
america needs to pay more attention to soft power and to multi@@ lat@@ eral cooperation .
that is the real lesson of september 11 th .
calling off america ’ s bombs
new york – as the us congress consi@@ ders whether to auth@@ ori@@ ze american military intervention in syria , its members should bear in mind a basic truth : while sy@@ rian president bas@@ har al-@@ as@@ sad has repeatedly used extreme violence to retain power , the united states – and other governments in the middle east and europe – share responsibility for turning syria into a killing field .
these governments , led by the us , have explicitly sought the violent over@@ throw of as@@ sad .
without their involvement , as@@ sad ’ s regime would most likely have remained repres@@ sive ; with their involvement , syria has become a site of mass death and destruction .
more than 100,000 people have died , and many of the world ’ s cultural and archae@@ ological treas@@ ures have been demo@@ li@@ shed .
syria ’ s civil war has occurred in two phases .
the first phase , roughly from january 2011 until march 2012 , was largely an internal aff@@ air .
when the arab spring erup@@ ted in tunisia and egypt in january 2011 , prote@@ sts erup@@ ted in syria as well .
in addition to the usual gri@@ ev@@ ances under a brutal regime , sy@@ ri@@ ans were re@@ eling from a massive drought and so@@ aring food prices .
the prote@@ sts became a military rebellion when parts of the sy@@ rian army broke with the regime and established the free sy@@ rian army .
neighbor@@ ing turkey was probably the first outside country to support the rebellion on the ground , giving sanctu@@ ary to rebel forces along its border with syria .
although the violence was escal@@ ating , the death toll was still in the thousands , not tens of thousands .
the second phase began when the us helped to organize a large group of countries to back the rebellion .
at a meeting of foreign ministers in istanbul on april 1 , 2012 , the us and other countries ple@@ dged active financial and logi@@ stical support for the free sy@@ rian army .
most important , th@@ en-@@ secretary of state hillary clinton declared : “ we think as@@ sad must go . ”
that open-@@ ended statement , without any clear means to achieve the goal that it announced , has done much to fuel military escal@@ ation and the rising death toll in syria , while pushing the us repeatedly to defend its “ credi@@ bility ” against a line in the sand that it should not have drawn .
then and now , the us has cla@@ imed to speak in the interest of the sy@@ rian people .
this is very doub@@ t@@ ful .
the us views syria mainly through the lens of iran , seeking to de@@ pose as@@ sad in order to depri@@ ve iran ’ s leaders of an important ally in the region , one that borders israel .
the us-@@ led effort in syria is thus best understood as a pro@@ xy war with iran – a cy@@ ni@@ cal strategy that has contributed to the massive rise in violence .
the us government ’ s mis@@ guided move from potential medi@@ ator and problem sol@@ ver to active bac@@ ker of the sy@@ rian insur@@ rec@@ tion was , predic@@ tably , a terrible mistake .
it put the us in effective opposition to the united nations peace initiative then being led by former un secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general kofi annan , whose approach was to call for a ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire followed by a negoti@@ ated political transition .
the us pre@@ emp@@ ted this process by bac@@ king the military rebellion and insi@@ sting on as@@ sad ’ s immediate de@@ par@@ ture .
it is hard to understand this bl@@ under .
even if the us ultimately sought to force as@@ sad from office , its bl@@ unt action har@@ den@@ ed as@@ sad ’ s resistance , as well as that of his two allies in the un security council , russia and china .
aside from seeking to defend their own interests in the region , both countries understand@@ ably rejected the idea of us-@@ led regime change in syria .
russia argued that america ’ s insi@@ stence on as@@ sad ’ s immediate de@@ par@@ ture was an im@@ pedi@@ ment to peace .
in this , russia was right .
indeed , russia was playing a plau@@ si@@ bly construc@@ tive role at the time , alb@@ eit one pre@@ mis@@ ed on as@@ sad remaining in power for at least a transi@@ tional period , if not in@@ definitely .
russia sought a pragmatic approach that would protect its commercial interests in syria and its na@@ val base at the port of tar@@ tus , while bringing an end to the blood@@ letting .
the russians open@@ ly backed annan ’ s peace initiative .
yet , with the us and others finan@@ cing the rebel@@ s , russia ( and iran ) supp@@ lied more – and more sophisticated – weapons to the regime .
now , with the use of chemical weapons , probably by the sy@@ rian government ( and possibly by both sides ) , the us has again rat@@ ch@@ eted up the stakes .
by@@ passing the un once again , the us is declar@@ ing its intention to intervene directly by bom@@ bing syria , o@@ sten@@ si@@ bly to deter the future use of chemical weapons .
america ’ s moti@@ vations are not entirely clear .
perhaps there is no underlying foreig@@ n-@@ policy logic , but only car@@ eless@@ ness .
if there is a kind of logic , however weak , it seems to revol@@ ve around iran and israel , rather than syria per se .
there are many dictator@@ ships in the world that the us does not try to over@@ throw .
on the contrary , many of them are o@@ sten@@ si@@ bly america ’ s close allies .
so why does the us continue to back a deadly rebellion in a civil war that is continuing to escal@@ ate danger@@ ously , now to the point of chemi@@ cal@@ -@@ weapons attacks ?
to put it simply , president barack obama ’ s administration has inherited the neo@@ conservative philosophy of regime change in the middle east .
the over@@ riding idea is that the us and its close allies get to choose who gover@@ ns in the region .
as@@ sad must go not because he is authoritarian , but because he is al@@ lied with iran , which , from the perspective of the us , israel , turkey , and several gulf countries , makes him a regional threat .
in fact , the us has probably been lu@@ red into serving these countries ’ own nar@@ ro@@ wer interests , whether it be israel ’ s un@@ convincing vision of its own security or the sun@@ ni countries ’ opposition to shi@@ a iran .
but , in the long term , us foreign policy divor@@ ced from international law cannot produce anything other than more war .
the us should reverse course .
a direct us attack on syria without un bac@@ king is far more likely to in@@ fl@@ ame the region than it is to resolve the crisis there – a point well appreciated in the united kingdom , where parliament bu@@ cked the government by reje@@ cting british participation in a military strike .
instead , the us should provide evidence of the chemical attacks to the un ; call on the security council to con@@ dem@@ n the perpetr@@ ators ; and refer such viol@@ ations to the international criminal court .
moreover , the obama administration should try to work with russia and china to en@@ force the chemical weapons convention .
if the us fails in this , while acting diplo@@ matically and transpar@@ ently ( without a un@@ il@@ ateral attack ) , russia and china would find themselves globally isolated on this important issue .
more broadly , the us should stop using countries like syria as prox@@ ies against iran .
with@@ dra@@ wal of us financial and logi@@ stical support for the rebellion , and calling on others to do the same , would not address syria ’ s author@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism or resolve america ’ s issues with iran , but it would stop or greatly reduce the large-scale killing and destruction in syria itself .
it would also enable the un peace process to res@@ u@@ me , this time with the us and russia working together to restra@@ in violence , keep al qaeda at bay ( a shared interest ) , and find a lon@@ ger-@@ term pragmatic solution to syria ’ s deep domestic di@@ visions .
and the search for a us modus vi@@ ven@@ di with iran – where a new president suggests a change of course on foreign policy – could be revi@@ ved .
it is time for the us to help stop the killing in syria .
that means aband@@ oning the fantasy that it can or should determine who rules in the middle east .
why america will lead the “ asian century ”
true , american power will inevitably decline in relative terms as asian giants such as china and india rise .
but , at least as far as asia is concerned , arguments about the end of american he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y ring hol@@ low .
for one thing , the united states was never a he@@ gem@@ on in asia .
only some american post-@@ cold war trium@@ p@@ hal@@ ists thought it was .
the nature of us power and the exercise of its influence was always much more clever and subtle than most assume .
in fact , as india and china rise , the us could actually find itself in a stronger position .
how can this be ?
after all , power and influence are built on the back of economic success .
the chinese economy has been doubling in size every ten years since 1978 .
the indian economy has been doing the same since 1991 .
in contrast , it takes about two decades for the us economy to double in size .
doesn ’ t this surely mean that asia is rus@@ hing toward a state of multi-@@ polar@@ ity – a configuration of roughly equal great powers balancing against each other – while american influence is on the wan@@ e ?
the seemingly obvious conclusion would be true but for the fact that asia has a unique kind of hierarch@@ ical security system that came about partly by accident and partly by design .
no power can be pre@@ em@@ in@@ ent if it cannot maintain its military advantage over ri@@ vals .
yet , despite the fact that america spends more on defense than the next ten powers combined , it has never been a regional he@@ gem@@ on because it actually reli@@ es on the cooperation of other states to remain pre@@ dominant .
without cooperation from allies such as japan , south korea , singapore , and the philippines , the us could not retain its forward military positions in the west pacific .
likewise , the us needs the cooperation of indonesia , malaysia , and thailand to host its critical radar infrastructure .
moreover , in remaining pre@@ em@@ in@@ ent , america requires other key states and regional grou@@ p@@ ings , such as as@@ ean , to acqui@@ es@@ ce in its security relationships .
thus , there is broad@@ -based regional approval of us alli@@ ances with japan , south korea , and australia , as well as with partners such as the philippines , singapore , thailand , and india .
the key to the effectiveness of these bil@@ ateral relationships is that they enjoy widespread support ( and thus legiti@@ macy ) in the region as stabili@@ zing arrangements .
the whole is greater than the sum of its parts .
combined with the raw military capacity that the us brings to the table , this means that america is powerful enough to en@@ force the peace and provide stability for commerce to thrive .
america ’ s presence and bil@@ ateral partnerships are comple@@ mentary to asian states ’ obsession with counter-@@ dominance and non-@@ interference in the region .
this dynamic “ liberal order ” – largely fair , flexible , and open enough to welcome new ent@@ rants as they rise – will continue to serve asia well .
for example , even china has been a major bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ ary of the public goods provided by the us-@@ led hierarch@@ ical system .
this inter@@ dependent relationship means that the us is not so powerful , that it can readily ignore the wishes of key states , and it is here that its apparent weakness is actually strength .
america is not a hob@@ bes@@ ian leviathan with absolute authority and power .
indeed , china ’ s strategi@@ sts are frequently puzz@@ led by the lack of “ balancing ” that takes place against the us in the region .
but it is puzz@@ ling only if we characteri@@ ze asia as being multi-@@ polar rather than hierarch@@ ical .
in fact , any balancing tends to take place in order to preserve the hierarchy , not to replace or super@@ se@@ de it .
other states tend to resist bi@@ ds by any asian power – be it japan , china or india – to rise to the top of the pyramid .
as a foreig@@ n-@@ based power , the us needs the cooperation of asian partners .
this keeps the top dog in check .
were an asian country like china to rise to the top , it would not need the same level of regional cooperation and acqui@@ es@@ cence to maintain its position and military fo@@ oth@@ olds .
as china and india rise , and japan becomes more “ normal , ” they will balance each other within the us-@@ led hierarchy to ensure that the us remains on top and one or the other doesn ’ t dominate .
if china makes a bid for regional he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y , it will find it difficult to resist the structural constraints placed on it within this hierarchy .
us power is in relative decline , but that is no bad thing .
false trium@@ p@@ hal@@ ism bre@@ eds poor discipline .
but a sense of strategic vulnerability bre@@ eds inter@@ dependen@@ cy , which has always been the key to successful us leadership in asia .
why an american recovery matters
mil@@ an – it is hard to be optimistic about america at present .
with the help of crucial government support in the crisis , the us financial sector ( or at least parts of it ) has boun@@ ced back , while america ’ s real economy strug@@ gles with high unemployment , dis@@ coura@@ ged labor@@ -@@ force dro@@ pou@@ ts , and damaged balance sheets .
so it is no surprise that the american public and the us congress are angry .
the focus of that anger has been the massive and un@@ wise finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ sector bon@@ uses .
as a result , regul@@ atory reforms have thus far consi@@ sted of , first , a threat to the federal reserve ’ s autonomy , and , second , a tax on bon@@ uses .
the first idea is a bad one .
the lat@@ ter may be politically mand@@ atory and margin@@ ally beneficial in fiscal terms . its effects on ris@@ k-@@ taking are debat@@ able .
but the mu@@ ch-@@ needed structural reforms to limit leverage and contain the risks that the financial system perio@@ di@@ cally im@@ poses on the real economy – and the public purse – have only bel@@ at@@ edly gotten off the to-@@ do list , and the pro@@ spe@@ cts of en@@ acting them are difficult to estimate .
in fairness , the new rule proposed by former us federal reserve chair@@ man paul vol@@ cker to separate financial inter@@ medi@@ ation from propri@@ etary trading is not a bad idea .
combined with elevated capital requirements for banks , it would reduce the chance of another simul@@ taneous failure of all credit channels .
but it is not sufficient .
he@@ dge funds can also dest@@ abili@@ ze the system , as the collapse of long term capital management in 1998 demonstrated .
so they also need clear , alb@@ eit different , limits on leverage .
heal@@ th-@@ care reform has deeply divided the american public and us politicians alike .
whatever the mer@@ its and short@@ com@@ ings of various pro@@ pos@@ als , these di@@ visions supp@@ ressed the bi@@ partisan aspects of the political process and emphasi@@ zed its zero-sum dimension .
one might expect that after a dangerous crisis rooted in growing structural im@@ balances and an unsustainable growth pattern on the demand side , there would be serious , ongoing debate about what is needed to restore long-term growth and productive job creation in the context of a rapidly evolving global economy .
but there is not , which is both puzz@@ ling and wor@@ ris@@ ome .
this is not to say that the us economy has lost its dynam@@ ism .
far from it .
but in the long term , sustaining it will require far-@@ sighted public policies and investments in hard and soft infrastructure to support the private sector ’ s high capacity for innovation .
there are those who disagree and believe that an economy ’ s dynam@@ ism is found almost entirely in the private sector , while the task of government is mainly to stay out of the way .
still others accept that government could in principal do something useful , but believe that it normally does not , and that the risks out@@ weigh the benefits .
a policy agenda in the us that is over@@ loaded , overwhel@@ m@@ ingly domest@@ ically focused , and partially paralyzed will mean a lack of attention to global issues that require cooperation and compromise , including the international dimensions of financial reform .
ab@@ sent coordination , there is also a risk that mon@@ etary policies designed to promote growth ( or at least not im@@ pe@@ de it ) will lead to a return of finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ sector distor@@ tions and im@@ balances .
the re@@ balancing and restor@@ ation of global demand in the medium term is discussed within the g-@@ 20 , but has not really gotten underway .
from the perspectives of both policy and investment , the short and medium term is once again risky .
many countries , including developing ones , will adopt defen@@ sive post@@ ures , some of which , such as making better use of the domestic market as a driver of growth , will have broadly positive impacts , even if growth pro@@ spe@@ cts are somewhat dimin@@ ished in the aggregate .
more importantly , the crisis high@@ ligh@@ ted the risks associated with high dependence on foreign capital .
that , combined with slow progress on finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ sector reform , makes it likely that ris@@ k-@@ aversion will pre@@ va@@ il , which could slow , if not reverse , financial globalization , and probably lead to slower growth in many countries .
re@@ starting the doha round of trade negotiations with a more manage@@ able agenda – and one focused on the poorer and more vulnerable developing countries – would be a good way to revi@@ ve progress on trade .
but , in an environment of slow growth and high unemployment , senti@@ ment in the advanced countries regar@@ ding efforts to liber@@ alize trade is distin@@ ctly negative .
the restor@@ ation of growth and balance in the us economy is cru@@ cially important , not only for its effect on global growth , but also as a foundation for tackling a broad array of international problems and challenges .
right now , it looks as though creating that foundation is on hold .
outside the advanced countries , there is a view that the world will return to pre-@@ crisis conditions , with a stable us that functions as bor@@ ro@@ wer , len@@ der , and consumer of last resort .
what this perspective ignor@@ es is that pre-@@ crisis growth in the us and the global economy was based in part on an unsustainable configuration .
returning to that model is neither likely nor wise .
while a relatively high and sustainable growth pattern can be achieved , it will take time .
and it will occur ( if it does ) in a global economy with fundamentally different structural and regul@@ atory characteristics .
waiting around for the advanced countries to right their ships so that we can all go back to the old normal is neither good policy nor a good bet .
what is needed is coordinated re@@ struc@@ turing and policy setting .
that is hard to do when the us , the largest fis@@ cally unified economy , is focused elsewhere .
why are good policies bad politics ?
berkeley – from the day after the collapse of le@@ hman brothers last year , the policies followed by the united states treas@@ ury , the us federal reserve , and the admini@@ strations of presidents george w. bush and barack obama have been sound and helpful .
the alternative – standing back and letting the markets handle things – would have brought america and the world higher unemployment than now exists .
credit e@@ asing and support of the banking system helped significantly by preventing much worse .
the fact that investment bankers did not go bank@@ rupt last december and are prof@@ iting immensely this year is a side issue .
every extra percentage point of unemployment lasting for two years costs $ 400 billion .
a recession twice as deep as the one we have had would have cost the us roughly $ 2 trillion – and cost the world as a whole four times as much .
in comparison , the bon@@ uses at goldman sachs are a ro@@ unding error .
and any attempt to make investment bankers suffer more last fall and winter would have put the entire support operation at risk .
as fed vice chair@@ man don ko@@ hn said , en@@ suring that a few thousand investment bankers receive their just financial punishment is a non-@@ starter when attempts to do so put the jobs of millions of americans – and tens of millions outside the us – at risk .
the obama administration ’ s fiscal stimulus has also significantly helped the economy .
though the jury is still out on the effect of the tax cuts in the stimulus , aid to states has been a job@@ -@@ saving success , and the flow of government spending on a whole variety of relatively useful projects is set to boost production and employment in the same way that consumer spending boo@@ sts production and employment .
and the cost of carrying the extra debt in@@ cur@@ red is extraordinarily low : $ 12 billion a year of extra taxes would be enough to finance the fis@@ cal@@ -@@ stimulus program at current interest rates .
for that price , american taxpa@@ yers will get an extra $ 1 trillion of goods and services , and employment will be higher by about ten million job@@ -@@ years .
the valid compla@@ ints about fiscal policy over the past 14 months are not that it has run up the national debt and rewar@@ ded the prin@@ ces of wall street , but rather that it has been too limited – that we ought to have done more .
yet these policies are political los@@ ers now : nobody is proposing more stimulus .
this is strange , because usually when something works the natural impulse is to do it again .
good policies that are boo@@ sting production and employment without causing inflation ought to be politically popular , right ?
with respect to obama ’ s stimulus package , it seems to me that there has been extraordinary intellectual and political dis@@ honesty on the american right , which the press ref@@ uses to see .
for two and a half centuries , economists have believed that the flow of spending in an economy goes up whenever groups of people decide to spend more .
sometimes spending rises because there is more dis@@ pos@@ able cash in the economy , and sometimes because changes in opportunity costs – the cost of for@@ going some other action , such as saving – make people want to spend the cash they have more rapidly .
sometimes and to some degree these increases show up as increases in prices , and sometimes and to some degree as increases in production and employment .
but , whatever the cause or effect , spending always goes up whenever groups decide to spend more – and government decisions to spend more are as good as anybody else ’ s .
they are as good as the decisions of mortgage companies and new home@@ bu@@ yers to spend more on new houses during the housing bubble of the mid-@@ 2000 ’ s , or of the prin@@ ces of silicon valley to spend more building new companies during the dot@@ -@@ com bubble of the late 1990 ’ s .
obama ’ s republican oppon@@ ents , who claim that fiscal stimulus cannot work , rely on arguments that are in@@ coherent at best , and usually simply wrong , if not mend@@ acious .
remember that back in 1993 , when the clinton administration ’ s analy@@ ses led it to seek to spend less and reduce the deficit , the republicans said that that would destroy the economy , too .
such claims were as wrong then as they are now .
but how many media reports make even a cur@@ sor@@ y effort to evaluate them ?
a stronger argument , though not by much , is that the fiscal stimulus is boo@@ sting employment and production , but at too great a long-@@ run cost because it has produced too large a boost in america &apos;s national debt .
if interest rates on us treas@@ ury se@@ curi@@ ties were high and rising rapidly as the debt grew , i would agree with this argument .
but interest rates on us treas@@ ury se@@ curi@@ ties are very low and are not rising .
every single treas@@ ury au@@ ction , at which the market go@@ b@@ bles up huge new tran@@ ches of us treas@@ ury debt at high prices , be@@ lies the argument that the economy has too much debt .
those who claim that america has a debt problem , and that a debt problem cannot be cu@@ red with more debt , ignore ( sometimes deliberately ) that private debt and us treas@@ ury debt have been very different animals – moving in different directions and behaving in different ways – since the start of the financial crisis .
what the market is saying is not that the economy has too much debt , but that it has too much private debt , which is why prices of corporate bonds are low and firms find finan@@ cing expensive .
the market is also saying – clearly and repeatedly – that the economy has too little public us government debt , which is why everyone wants to hold it .
why are governments paralyzed ?
mil@@ an – it is no secret that the global economy is struggling .
europe is in the midst of a crisis whose root cause is a struc@@ turally fla@@ wed mon@@ etary and economic union .
the united states , emerging slowly from a financial crisis and widespread dele@@ ver@@ aging , is experiencing a growth slow@@ down , a persistent employment problem , an ad@@ verse shift in income distribution , and structural challenges , with little effective or decisi@@ ve policy action .
meanwhile , among the major emerging economies , china ’ s reform process is on hold , pen@@ ding a leadership transition this fall that will clari@@ fy various internal interests ’ goals and power relationships .
india , which has lost reform momentum , is experiencing an economic slow@@ down and a potential loss of investor confidence .
the negative effects of these problems are now interacting , feeding back on themselves , and spreading to the rest of the global economy .
and yet , despite a pal@@ pable sense of concern that something is very wrong , the progno@@ sis for significant change is b@@ leak – and de@@ terior@@ ating .
what accounts for the apparent lack of effective policy action across a broad range of countries and regions ?
one line of thinking bl@@ ames a “ leadership vacuum ” – a common diagnosis in europe .
elsewhere – especially in the us – polari@@ zation and ugly zero-sum politics are thought to dis@@ courage potentially capable political leadership .
but , ab@@ sent further analysis , the leadership vacuum becomes a cat@@ ch@@ all explanation .
what we need to know is why new political leadership in democracies like france , britain , japan , and the us has produced so little change .
a second explanation add@@ resses that question : while bold action is required , the complexity of economic conditions , and disagreement about the right policy responses , impli@@ es a risk of serious error .
on this view , risk aversion both reflects and rein@@ forces a divergence between individual incentives ( the desire to be re@@ elected , re@@ ap@@ pointed , or promot@@ ed ) and collective needs ( fixing problems ) .
a third answer is that policy instruments are simply in@@ effective in today ’ s conditions .
there is some mer@@ it to this claim .
economic dele@@ ver@@ aging takes time .
the restor@@ ation of sustainable patterns of growth requires years , not months .
expectations may be out of line with the underlying reality .
but the absence of a quick solution does not mean that nothing can be done to improve the speed and quality of recovery .
vest@@ ed interests may also play a role .
technological innovation and global market forces have produced a decisi@@ ve shift in income toward capital and the upper 20 % of the income distribution , often at the expense of middle-@@ income groups , the unemployed , and the young .
the bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ aries of these trends may have accum@@ ulated enough political influence to maintain the status quo , high@@ lighting distribu@@ tional issues that have generally received too little attention in understanding policy responses or their absence .
there are structural explanations for policy in@@ action as well .
governance systems and constitu@@ tional structures differ in the extent to which they require broad consensus for official action , or to change policy direction in response to sho@@ cks or shifting conditions .
some argue that the more constra@@ ining political systems work well in stable times , but perform poorly under vola@@ tile conditions like those prevail@@ ing today .
others support constrained government on the grounds that it protects everyone from waste , r@@ ent-@@ seeking , and interference with freedom of choice , and that , when needed , inspired leadership can build the required consensus to address changing circumstances .
high hur@@ d@@ les to major shifts in policy direction force officials to make a convincing case .
that is an inherently difficult task at a time when rapid change in the global economy has left many still trying to understand what is happening and what it all means for growth , stability , the distribution of income , and employment .
in the face of such complexity , it is not surprising that genuine policy dis@@ agre@@ ements lead to extended debate and relatively little action .
moreover , the techno@@ cratic elements of government must often be balanced against democratic accountability .
in every society , individuals with special training and expertise are ap@@ pointed to perform technically complex functions .
their freedom of action is constrained by time limits and re@@ appointment procedures that determine the nature and degree of their accountability to elected officials and the public .
there can be too little freedom of action ( popu@@ li@@ sm ) or too little accountability ( auto@@ cracy ) .
the necessary balance may vary according to local conditions .
for example , many china obser@@ vers believe that accountability there needs to increase at this stage of the country ’ s economic , social , and political evolution .
others argue that western democracies have the opposite problem : a sur@@ f@@ eit of narrow , politically asser@@ tive interests leads to under@@ investment and poor trade@@ offs between present and future opportunities and performance .
this brings us to a crucial obstacle : government , business , financial , and academic elites are not trusted .
lack of trust in elites is probably healthy at some level , but numerous polls indicate that it is in rapid decline , which surely increases citizens ’ rel@@ uc@@ tance to dele@@ gate authority to navigate an un@@ certain global economic environment .
loss of trust probably has multiple causes , including analytical failure : central banks , regul@@ ators , market participants , rating agencies , and economists almost all failed to detect rising systemic risk in the years prece@@ ding the current crisis , much less to take appropriate correc@@ tive action .
but a more important cause is a suspi@@ cion that elites are placing their own interests above shared social values .
claims that our leadership , institutions , analy@@ ses , or policy instruments are inadequate to the task at hand surely contain a ker@@ nel of truth .
but the deeper problem is a breakdown in precisely such values and goals – that is , a weak@@ ening of social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on .
restor@@ ing it will require analy@@ sts , policymakers , business leaders , and ci@@ vil@@ -@@ society groups to clari@@ fy causes , share blame for mistakes , pursue flexible solutions in which costs are shared equ@@ it@@ ably , and , most important , explain that hard problems cannot be solved overnight .
cambridge – as policymakers and investors continue to fre@@ t over the risks posed by today ’ s ultra-@@ low global interest rates , academic economists continue to debate the underlying causes . by now , everyone accep@@ ts some version of us federal reserve chair@@ man ben ber@@ nan@@ ke ’ s statement in 2005 that a “ global savings gl@@ ut ” is at the root of the problem .
but economists disagree on why we have the gl@@ ut , how long it will last , and , most fundamentally , on whether it is a good thing .
ber@@ nan@@ ke ’ s original speech emphasi@@ zed several factors – some that decreased the demand for global savings , and some that increased supply .
either way , interest rates would have to fall in order for world bond markets to clear .
he pointed to how the asian financial crisis in the late 1990 ’ s caused the region ’ s vor@@ acious investment demand to collapse , while simultaneously in@@ ducing asian governments to stock@@ pile liquid assets as a he@@ dge against another crisis . ber@@ nan@@ ke also pointed to increased retirement saving by aging populations in germany and japan , as well as to saving by o@@ il-@@ expor@@ ting countries , with their rapidly growing populations and concerns about oil revenues in the long term .
mon@@ etary policy , incidentally , did not feature promin@@ ently in ber@@ nan@@ ke ’ s diagnosis .
like most economists , he believes that if policymakers try to keep interest rates at artifi@@ cially low levels for too long , eventually demand will so@@ ar and inflation will jump .
so , if inflation is low and stable , central banks cannot be bl@@ amed for low long-term rates .
in fact , i strongly suspect that if one poll@@ ed investors , mon@@ etary policy would be at the top of the list , not ab@@ sent from it , as an explanation of low global long-term interest rates .
the fact that so many investors hold this view ought to make one think twice before absol@@ ving mon@@ etary policy of all responsibility .
nevertheless , i share ber@@ nan@@ ke ’ s instinct that , while central banks do set very short-term interest rates , they have virtually no influence over long-term real ( infla@@ tion-@@ adju@@ sted ) rates , other than a modest effect through portfolio management policies ( for example , “ quantitative e@@ asing ” ) .
a lot has changed since 2005 .
we had the financial crisis , and some of the factors c@@ ited by ber@@ nan@@ ke have substan@@ tially rever@@ sed .
for example , asian investment is boom@@ ing again , led by china .
and yet global interest rates are even lower now than they were then .
why ?
there are several competing theories , most of them quite elegant , but none of them entirely satis@@ factory .
one view holds that long-term growth risks have been on the rise , raising the premi@@ um on assets that are perceived to be relatively safe , and raising pre@@ cau@@ tionary saving in general .
( of course , no one should think that any government bonds are completely safe , particularly from inflation and financial repres@@ sion . )
certainly , the 2008 financial crisis should have been a wa@@ ke@@ up call to pro@@ pon@@ ents of the “ great moder@@ ation ” view that long-term vola@@ tili@@ ty has fallen .
many studies suggest that it is becoming more difficult than ever to an@@ chor expectations about long-term growth trends .
witness , for example , the active debate about whether technological progress is accelerating or dec@@ eler@@ ating .
shifting geo@@ political power also bre@@ eds uncertainty .
another class of academic theories follows ber@@ nan@@ ke ( and , even earlier , michael do@@ o@@ ley , david fol@@ ker@@ ts@@ -@@ lan@@ da@@ u , and peter gar@@ ber ) in attribu@@ ting low long-term interest rates to the growing importance of emerging economies , but with the major emphasis on private savings rather than public savings .
because emerging economies have relatively weak asset markets , their citizens seek safe haven in advan@@ ce@@ d-@@ country government bonds .
a related theory is that emerging economies ’ citizens find it difficult to diversi@@ fy the huge risk inherent in their fast-@@ growing but vola@@ tile environments , and feel particularly vulnerable as a result of weak social safety nets .
so they save massively .
these explanations have some mer@@ it , but one should recognize that central banks and sovereig@@ n wealth funds , not private citizens , are the players most directly responsible for the big savings sur@@ pl@@ uses .
it is a strain to think that governments have the same moti@@ vations as private citizens .
besides , on closer in@@ spe@@ ction , the emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market explanation , though convenient , is not quite as compelling as it might seem .
emerging economies are growing much faster than the advanced countries , which ne@@ oc@@ lassi@@ cal growth models suggest should push global interest rates up , not down .
similarly , the integration of emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market countries into the global economy has brought with it a flood of labor .
according to standard trade theory , a global labor gl@@ ut ought to imp@@ ly an increased rate of return on capital , which again pushes interest rates up , not down .
surely , any explanation must include the global con@@ stri@@ ction of credit , especially for small and medi@@ um-@@ size businesses .
ti@@ ghter regulation of len@@ ding standards has shut out an important source of global investment demand , putting down@@ ward pressure on interest rates .
my best guess is that when global uncertainty fa@@ des and global growth picks up , global interest rates will start to rise , too .
but predicting the timing of this transition is difficult .
the puzzle of the global savings gl@@ ut may live on for several years to come .
au@@ ster@@ ity and demor@@ alization
new haven – the high unemployment that we have today in europe , the united states , and elsewhere is a tragedy , not just because of the aggregate output loss that it ent@@ a@@ ils , but also because of the personal and emotional cost to the unemployed of not being a part of working society .
british prime minister david cameron , an au@@ ster@@ ity advocate , says he believes that his program reduces “ welfare dependen@@ cy , ” re@@ stores “ ri@@ g@@ or , ” and encoura@@ ges the “ the do@@ ers , the creators , the life-@@ affir@@ mers . ”
likewise , us con@@ gress@@ man paul ryan says that his program is part of a plan to promote “ creativity and entrepreneurial spirit . ”
some kinds of au@@ ster@@ ity programs may indeed boost mor@@ ale .
mon@@ ks find their life ’ s meaning in a most aust@@ ere environment , and military boot camps are thought to build character .
but the kind of fiscal au@@ ster@@ ity that is being practiced now has the immediate effect of rendering people job@@ less and filling their lives with nothing but a sense of reje@@ ction and exclu@@ sion .
one could imagine that a spell of unemployment might be a time of reflection , re@@ establishment of personal connections , and getting back to fundamental values .
some economists even thought long ago that we would be enjoying much more leisure by this point .
john may@@ n@@ ard key@@ nes , in his 19@@ 30 essay “ economic possibilities for our grandchildren , ” spe@@ cul@@ ated that , within a hundred years , that is , by 2030 , higher incomes would reduce the average work@@ day to a mere three hours , for a total work@@ week of only 15 hours .
while there are still 17 years to go , it appears that key@@ nes was way off the mark .
so was robert the@@ ob@@ ald , who , in his 196@@ 3 book free men and free markets questioned the public ’ s repu@@ gn@@ ance toward high unemployment .
he asser@@ ted that “ we can have meaningful leisure rather than destructive unemployment , ” and that we do not need “ a whirl@@ ing-@@ der@@ vis@@ h economy dependent on compul@@ sive consumption . ”
but finding something satisfying to do with our time seems inevitably to ent@@ a@@ il doing some sort of work : “ meaningful leisure ” we@@ ars thin after a while .
people seem to want to work more than three hours a day , even if it is assem@@ bl@@ y-@@ line work .
and the opportunity to work should be a basic freedom .
unemployment is a product of capitalism : people who are no longer needed are simply made redund@@ ant .
on the traditional family farm , there was no unemployment .
au@@ ster@@ ity ex@@ poses the modern economy ’ s lack of inter@@ personal connectedness and the mor@@ ale costs that this impli@@ es .
wor@@ k-@@ sharing might keep more people margin@@ ally attached to their jobs in an economic sl@@ um@@ p , thereby preserving their self-esteem .
instead of laying off 25 % of its workforce in a recession , a company could tempor@@ arily reduce workers ’ hours from , say , eight per day to six .
everyone would remain employed , and all would come a little closer to key@@ nes ’ s ideal .
some countries , not@@ ably germany , have encouraged this approach .
but wor@@ k-@@ sharing raises technical problems if increased suddenly to deal with an economic crisis like the one we are now experiencing .
these problems pre@@ clu@@ de the sudden movement toward the ideal of greater leisure that thinkers like key@@ nes and the@@ ob@@ ald pro@@ cla@@ imed .
one problem is that workers have fixed costs , such as transportation to work or a health plan , that do not decline when hours ( and thus pay ) are cut .
their deb@@ ts and obli@@ ga@@ tions are similarly fixed .
they could have bought a smaller house had they known that their hours would be reduced , but now it is difficult to down@@ size the one that they did buy .
another problem is that it may be difficult to reduce everyone ’ s job by the same amount , because some jobs scale up and down with production , while others do not .
in his book why wages don ’ t fall during a recession , tru@@ man be@@ w@@ ley of yale university reported on an extensive set of interviews with business managers involved with wa@@ ge-@@ setting and la@@ yo@@ ffs .
he found that they believed that a serious mor@@ ale problem would result from reducing everyone ’ s hours and pay during a recession .
then all employees would begin to feel as if they did not have a real job .
in his interviews with managers , he was told that it is best ( at least from a manager ’ s point of view ) if the pain of reduced employment is concentrated on a few people , whose gr@@ um@@ bling is not heard by the remaining employees .
emplo@@ yers worry about workplace mor@@ ale , not about the mor@@ ale of the employees they lay off .
their damaged mor@@ ale certainly affects others as a sort of extern@@ ality , which matters very much ; but it does not matter to the firm that has laid them off .
we could perhaps all be happy working fewer hours if the decline reflected gradu@@ al social progress .
but we are not happy with unemployment that results from a sudden fiscal crisis .
that is why sudden au@@ ster@@ ity cannot be a mor@@ ale buil@@ der .
for mor@@ ale , we need a social compact that finds a purpose for everyone , a way to show ones@@ elf to be part of society by being a worker of some sort .
and for that we need fiscal stimulus – ide@@ ally , the deb@@ t-@@ friendly stimulus that raises taxes and expen@@ di@@ tures equally .
the increased tax burden for all who are employed is analog@@ ous to the reduced hours in wor@@ k-@@ sharing .
but , if tax increases are not politically expe@@ dient , policymakers should proceed with old-fashioned deficit spending .
the important thing is to achieve any fiscal stimulus that boo@@ sts job creation and puts the unemployed back to work .
end au@@ ster@@ ity now
edinburgh – in recent weeks , talk about a bud@@ ding recovery in the euro@@ zone has gained tra@@ ction , with key indi@@ ces pointing to expansion in the core countries – data that many are c@@ iting as evidence that au@@ ster@@ ity is finally working .
mon@@ e@@ y-@@ market funds from the united states are returning , alb@@ eit cau@@ ti@@ ously , to res@@ u@@ me funding of european bank debt .
even goldman sachs is now bu@@ lli@@ sh@@ ly pil@@ ing into european equi@@ ties .
but is a recovery really underway ?
cy@@ ni@@ cs recall that a european recovery was supposed to take hold as early as the fourth quarter of 2010 , and that every international mon@@ etary fund projection since then has predicted recovery “ by the end of the year . ”
instead , gdp has collapsed , with the spanish and italian economies expected to contract by close to 2 % this year .
portugal ’ s economy is set to shrink by more than 2 % , and greece ’ s output will fall by more than 4 % .
moreover , unemployment in the euro@@ zone has sky@@ rock@@ eted to an average rate of roughly 12 % , with more than 50 % youth unemployment in the peripher@@ y countries im@@ plying a long-term loss of talent and erosion of the tax base .
and , despite the spike in unemployment , productivity growth in the euro@@ zone is deci@@ de@@ dly negative .
more significant , over the last year , the public debt / gdp ratio rose by seven percentage points in italy , 11 in ireland , and 15 in portugal and spain .
if the sine qu@@ a non of recovery via au@@ ster@@ ity is the stabili@@ zation and reduction of debt , the cy@@ ni@@ cs ’ case appears to have been made .
against this background , the return of us investors to provide short-term dollar funding for european bank debt sma@@ cks of a desperate hunt for yield that reli@@ es on european central bank president mari@@ o dra@@ gh@@ i ’ s promise to do “ whatever it takes ” to save the euro .
as for goldman ’ s equity play , as bon@@ d-@@ market guru bill bla@@ in put it , “ the words ‘ buy cheap , sell a bit de@@ ar@@ er on the up , and then dump and run ’ spring to mind . ”
in fact , any talk of recovery is premature until the losses in@@ cur@@ red by au@@ ster@@ ity are rec@@ ou@@ ped .
as it stands , every country that has implemented an au@@ ster@@ ity program without im@@ posing losses on private credi@@ tors has more debt now than when it started .
for example , according to official estimates , spain ’ s public debt , which amo@@ unted to only about 36 % of gdp when the crisis began , has almost tri@@ pled – and the actual figure may be much higher .
more telling , the countries that cut expen@@ di@@ ture the most experienced the largest bon@@ d-@@ yield spikes and the most significant debt growth .
the explanation for this is simple . when a country gives up its mon@@ etary sovereig@@ n@@ ty , its banks are effectively borrowing in a foreign currency , making them excep@@ tionally vulnerable to liqui@@ dity sho@@ cks , like that which spar@@ ked tur@@ mo@@ il in europe ’ s banking system in 20@@ 10-@@ 2011 .
the government , unable to print money to ba@@ il out the banks or increase export competi@@ tiveness through currency de@@ valu@@ ation , is left with only two options : default or def@@ lation ( au@@ ster@@ ity ) .
au@@ ster@@ ity ’ s underlying logic is that budget cuts , by reducing the debt burden and restor@@ ing confidence , ultimately enhance stability and support growth .
but , when countries pursue au@@ ster@@ ity simultaneously with their main trading partners , overall demand plum@@ me@@ ts , causing all of their economies to contract and , in turn , increasing their debt / gdp rati@@ os .
but the problem with au@@ ster@@ ity in the euro@@ zone is more fundamental : policymakers are attemp@@ ting to address a sovereig@@ n-@@ debt crisis , though the real problem is a banking crisis .
with europe ’ s banking system triple the size and twice as lever@@ aged as its us counter@@ part , and the ec@@ b lac@@ king genuine len@@ der-@@ of-@@ la@@ st-@@ resort authority , the sudden halt in capital flows to peripher@@ al countries in 2009 created a liqui@@ di@@ ty-@@ star@@ ved system that was too big to ba@@ il out .
as holders of euro@@ -@@ denomin@@ ated assets recognized this situation , they turned to the ec@@ b for insurance ( which the ec@@ b could not deliver under its previous president , jean-@@ c@@ lau@@ de tri@@ ch@@ et , whose leadership was defined by his commitment to maintaining price stability ) .
investors ’ subsequ@@ ent efforts to price in the risk of a euro@@ zone break@@ up – not the volume of sovereig@@ n debt – caused bond yields to spike .
but the finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ market tur@@ mo@@ il fu@@ eled a panic among euro@@ zone leaders , leading them to mis@@ diagnose the mal@@ ady and prescribe the wrong medicine , which has served only to generate new symptoms .
while dra@@ gh@@ i ’ s promise , embodied by the ec@@ b ’ s “ ou@@ tri@@ ght mon@@ etary trans@@ actions ” program – as well as its long-term re@@ finan@@ cing operation and emergency liqui@@ dity assistance program – has bought time and lower@@ ed yields , the euro@@ zone ’ s banking crisis persi@@ sts .
euro@@ zone leaders must recognize that spending cuts will do nothing to stabilize the balance sheets of cor@@ e-@@ country banks that are over-@@ exposed to peripher@@ al countries ’ sovereig@@ n debt .
until europe reje@@ cts au@@ ster@@ ity in favor of a grow@@ th-@@ oriented approach , all signs of recovery will prove ill@@ us@@ ory .
why ban@@ non had to go
washington , dc – in many , if not most , us admini@@ strations , some figure emerges who convin@@ ces the press that the president couldn ’ t function without him ( it ’ s yet to be a her ) .
the in@@ dispen@@ s@@ able ai@@ de is , indeed , one of the most well-@@ wor@@ n tro@@ pes of the modern pres@@ iden@@ cy .
karl ro@@ ve was “ bush ’ s brain ” ; harry hopkins held franklin del@@ ano roosevelt ’ s proli@@ fic white house team together ; bill mo@@ yers appeared on a magazine cover as “ johnson ’ s good angel . ”
without such a figure , the story inevitably goes , the administration would be a mess , if not a disaster .
as often as not , the tro@@ pe is invented or encouraged by the particular in@@ dispen@@ s@@ able figure .
journalists usually fall for the story , regardless of how well-@@ founded it is : it clari@@ fies everything , and it gives them something to write about .
the in@@ dispen@@ s@@ able ai@@ de is only too happy to reveal some dramatic story about how he saved the day , de@@ vised some particularly ingenious idea , or prevented some terrible mistake .
but , as often as not , the so@@ i-@@ dis@@ ant crucial figure over@@ steps .
in the reagan white house , don reg@@ an , who succeeded james baker as chief of staff , fan@@ ci@@ ed himself the prime minister : he inser@@ ted himself into photos of reagan with soviet leader mik@@ ha@@ il gor@@ bach@@ e@@ v , was ru@@ de to lesser beings ( including reporters ) , and made the fatal mistake of hanging up on nancy reagan , who was dedicated to looking after her ron@@ ny .
reg@@ an was soon out .
presidents themselves aren ’ t particularly fond of reading how some super-@@ smart ai@@ de saved their bac@@ on .
all presidents have healthy egos – if others are so smart , why aren ’ t they president ?
the wise presi@@ dent@@ -@@ ele@@ ct identifi@@ es a peac@@ o@@ ck and avo@@ ids the species from the start , or knows how to keep its feathers in check .
barack obama was plenty pleased with himself , with reason , but such was his dignity that no super-@@ ai@@ de emerged during his pres@@ iden@@ cy .
it didn ’ t occur to his advis@@ ers to try to out@@ shine him .
stephen ban@@ non wasn ’ t particularly wise as a white house ai@@ de – he couldn ’ t contain his inner peac@@ o@@ ck – and don@@ ald trum@@ p ’ s ego is particularly fragile .
both are or were mis@@ fits in their roles .
trum@@ p had spent his business life surrounded by family and fl@@ un@@ kies : no stock@@ holders or vice chair@@ men with their own ambi@@ tions .
the two men were a mis@@ match made in white house hell .
as a candidate , trum@@ p went with his instincts , and his instinct in the 20@@ 16 presidential race was that blu@@ e-@@ collar workers and others who fe@@ ared for their economic future needed their own victims , be they mexican immigr@@ ants or billion@@ aire bankers .
a wall – phantas@@ mag@@ or@@ ical or not – would keep out the “ bad people ” mexico was “ sending us . ” as it happened , of all the people around trum@@ p , ban@@ non most matched these views .
a person like ban@@ non – who presents himself as a learned figure and con@@ firms one ’ s own brilliance – is a person one wants to have close by .
once elected , he brought in billion@@ aires to popu@@ late his cabinet , and so far seems to have gotten away with telling his suppor@@ ters that really rich people are needed to run the country .
ban@@ non , on the other hand , wrapped himself in what might be loo@@ sely ter@@ med a philosophy , which consi@@ sted of a ni@@ hi@@ li@@ stic anger toward any “ establishment . ”
but his was fau@@ x popu@@ li@@ sm : while ban@@ non politically champi@@ oned blu@@ e-@@ collar workers , he lived on the millions he had atta@@ ined from a st@@ int at goldman sachs and through a fortunate investment in the tv comedy series “ sein@@ feld . ”
he also flour@@ ished with bac@@ king from the billion@@ aire mer@@ cer family .
the mer@@ cers , who made their fortune through the high-tech genius of patri@@ arch robert mer@@ cer and a he@@ dge fund he led , fund breit@@ bart news , a far-@@ right website for@@ mer@@ ly edited by ban@@ non that promotes ultra-@@ nation@@ alism and white supre@@ macy , with a whi@@ ff of anti-@@ semi@@ tism .
ban@@ non ’ s o@@ sten@@ si@@ bly radical views were dressed up in a fancy set of principles em@@ bro@@ i@@ dered with nam@@ e-@@ drops of far-@@ out thinkers .
in trade and immigration , for example , ban@@ non ’ s acquired philosophy alig@@ ned with trum@@ p ’ s political opport@@ un@@ ism ( trum@@ p ’ s more liberal , often demo@@ cr@@ at-@@ bac@@ king former self is another story ) .
it was a mistake to see ban@@ non as pyg@@ mali@@ on to trum@@ p ’ s gal@@ ate@@ a , or , as some did , as the trum@@ p white house ’ s ras@@ pu@@ tin .
ban@@ non rein@@ forced the nation@@ alist in@@ clin@@ ation that led trum@@ p to over@@ rule his daughter i@@ van@@ ka and his economic advis@@ ers by with@@ drawing from the paris climate agreement .
and ban@@ non in@@ tru@@ ded on foreign policy by getting himself put on the national security council for a while , until two of the gener@@ als in trum@@ p ’ s administration – national security advis@@ er h. r. mc@@ master and john kelly ( now the chief of staff ) – got him removed .
( ban@@ non was believed to be behind the recent push to force out mc@@ master , mainly by suggesting that he is “ anti-@@ israel . ” )
but ban@@ non ’ s role as geni@@ us-@@ wi@@ thou@@ t-@@ portfolio – in which trum@@ p indul@@ ged him , until kelly arrived and clari@@ fied chains of command – was his un@@ doing .
without any defined responsibilities , he in@@ tru@@ ded where he wished – and ended up with a lot of enemies .
he had plenty of time to fight internal bat@@ tles by feeding reporters stories about his white house ri@@ vals , though he would switch someone ( for example , former chief of staff rein@@ ce prie@@ bus ) from ri@@ val to friend , as convenient .
ban@@ non was a trou@@ ble@@ maker as much as a policy@@ maker – and the two roles didn ’ t mesh .
trum@@ p also began to see ban@@ non as a “ le@@ ak@@ er . ”
and trum@@ p ’ s white house is all too le@@ aky : many who work there let reporters know that they have , at best , mixed feelings about working for trum@@ p , but believe the better part of val@@ or is to stay and protect the country from his leadership .
ban@@ non ’ s bra@@ g@@ ga@@ do@@ ci@@ o took him to the most dangerous terrain on which to confront trum@@ p : the president ’ s obsession with his election victory .
the ambiguity of winning the elec@@ toral college vote ( not , as he has fal@@ sely cla@@ imed , by the greatest margin since reagan ) but losing the popular vote by nearly three million votes , dogs trum@@ p .
that ’ s why he invented millions of “ illegal ” voters and had maps printed showing the states he won in red – covering most of the territory of the united states – even suggesting to at least one reporter that his newspaper run the map on the paper ’ s front page .
suggestions by ban@@ non that he played a major role in trum@@ p ’ s election victory were pois@@ on@@ ous to the relationship between the two men .
and so this white house mis@@ fit finally had to go .
now that ban@@ non is gone , however , he will hur@@ l missi@@ ves from his new@@ -@@ old per@@ ch at breit@@ bart , to which he returned the same day as his announced de@@ par@@ ture .
and trum@@ p will still be trum@@ p .
why barack obama ?
new york – the winner of america ’ s presidential election will inher@@ it a perfect storm of problems , both economic and international .
he will face the most difficult open@@ ing-@@ day agenda of any president since – and i say this in all seriousness – the man who saved the union , abraham lincoln .
but a more instruc@@ tive prece@@ dent is 193@@ 3 , when franklin roosevelt offered inspiring rhetoric and “ bold experimentation ” to a nation facing economic mel@@ t@@ down and a breakdown in public confidence .
for me , the choice is simple – and not only because i am , by temper@@ ament and history , a demo@@ crat .
the long and intense political campaign has revealed huge differences in the two candidates ’ positions , style , and personal qualities .
and the conclusion seems clear .
judgment .
john mccain has shown throughout his career a pen@@ chant for ris@@ k-@@ taking ; in his memo@@ irs , he prou@@ dly calls himself a gam@@ bler .
his selection of sarah palin , a charis@@ matic but spectac@@ ularly un@@ qualified candidate , as his running mate , is just the most gl@@ aring of many examples of the real mccain .
his bra@@ very in combat at@@ tests to his patrio@@ tism , courage , and toug@@ hness , but his judgment has been found sor@@ ely lac@@ king time and time again over his career .
barack obama is tough , too , but in a different way .
no one should underestimate how difficult it was to travel his road , against incredible odds , to the cus@@ p of the pres@@ iden@@ cy .
but where mccain is impul@@ sive and emotional , obama is low-@@ key and un@@ emotional .
he makes his judgments in a calm and methodi@@ cal manner ; mccain ’ s impul@@ si@@ veness is ana@@ thema to obama , and rightly so – one cannot play cra@@ ps with history .
having seen so many political leaders fal@@ ter under pressure , i prize this ability above most others .
and barack obama has it .
the economy .
the first priority of the new president will be the economy and the financial crisis .
since the crisis hit , obama has been calm and , indeed , presidential .
he consul@@ ted the best advis@@ ory team in the nation , weighed each course of action carefully , and then issued a series of precise , calm statements .
meanwhile , mccain has ve@@ ered bizar@@ rely , issu@@ ing contradi@@ c@@ tory statements , “ suspen@@ ding ” his campaign ( while continuing to campaign ) , and ur@@ ging that the first debate be can@@ cel@@ ed ( when it was all the more needed ) .
advantage obama .
foreign policy .
the most explicit dis@@ agre@@ ements between the candidates are over iraq , iran , and russia .
but there are deeper differences .
mccain ’ s positions , with the not@@ able exception of climate change , suggest that he would simply try to carry out george w. bush ’ s policies more effectively .
obama offers a different approach to foreign policy .
by starting to draw down combat troops in iraq , obama would change the image and policies of america immediately .
by engaging iran in talks that would cover not only the nuclear issue but other aspects of iran ’ s dest@@ abili@@ zing role in the region , he would either reach agre@@ ements that lower@@ ed the dangers from iran , or he would mobili@@ ze a stronger international coalition to isol@@ ate iran .
either way , engaging iran is the right policy , and it is hard to understand why bush and mccain have continued to hold out against such an obvious change of course , which , if carried out with firm@@ ness , will not compromise american or israeli national security .
on russia since its invasion of georgia , obama and his running mate , joe bi@@ den ( who was the first member of congress to visit georgia after the invasion ) , emphasize helping georgia rebuild its economy and maintain its independence in the face of a continuing russian campaign against it .
mccain , on the other hand , wants to punish russia by such actions as exp@@ elling it from the g-@@ 8 .
such measures may ultimately be necessary , but they will not help georgia survive as an independent democracy .
moreover , even after the ou@@ trage in georgia , there are issues of common interest – such as energy , climate change , and iran – on which the west and the kre@@ m@@ lin must cooperate .
this was true even during the cold war , and remains true today , yet mccain seems not to recognize it .
leadership .
in the end , all presidential elections come down to the in@@ tan@@ gi@@ bles of leadership .
the vote for a president is a sort of private contract directly between each vot@@ er and his or her preferred choice .
who do you want to see on your television screen for the next four years ?
here again , the contra@@ sting styles of obama and mccain offer a clear choice between a calm and confident man and a highly emotional one , between a major change in the nation ’ s direction and a minor one , between a con@@ ci@@ li@@ atory style and a more com@@ ba@@ tive one .
effectiveness .
finally , in a year in which the democrats are certain to increase their majority in both houses of congress , an obama victory would offer the democrats control of both the leg@@ isla@@ tive and executive branches for the first time since 1994 , and with it the possibility of leg@@ isla@@ tive achievement after years of stal@@ e@@ mate .
after so many years of polari@@ zation at home and un@@ il@@ ater@@ alism abroad , the choice for president seems clear .
why bi@@ partis@@ ans@@ hip is good politics
london – bi@@ partis@@ ans@@ hip seems to have taken a dru@@ b@@ bing in washington since president barack obama got to the white house .
like most recent american presidents , obama campaig@@ ned on a promise to work with his political oppon@@ ents for the greater good of the country .
bill clinton said much the same thing before he was elected , and then spent his first term in a kno@@ ck@@ down fight with new@@ t g@@ in@@ gr@@ ich ’ s republican majority in congress , and his second term fighting off im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ment .
george w. bush also said that he would reach out to those who dis@@ agreed with him .
he then turned into the most partisan and ideological president of modern times , eg@@ ged on by his vi@@ ce-@@ president , dick chen@@ ey .
obama already appears to have gone further in the pursuit of bi@@ partis@@ ans@@ hip than his pre@@ de@@ cess@@ ors .
his selection of republicans for key posts – including re@@ taining robert gates as secretary of defense – has raised a few eyebro@@ ws among his suppor@@ ters .
but , above all , he has tried hard to secure republican support for his efforts to prevent the economy from disappearing into a deep rec@@ essi@@ on@@ ary hole .
only three ma@@ ver@@ ick republican sen@@ ators went along with obama ’ s pro@@ pos@@ als to get the plan accepted .
and in the house of representatives , the republicans un@@ anim@@ ously rejected every am@@ end@@ ment , every compromise , and every cour@@ tes@@ y that he offered .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators suggest that obama made a bad mistake .
first , he promised bi@@ partis@@ ans@@ hip , but got heavily re@@ buff@@ ed .
second , he and his administration were so busy trying to build consensus that they wat@@ ered down some of the vital ingredients of the stimulus package , and failed to defend it robu@@ stly from republican attack .
there may sometimes be a down@@ side in trying to woo your oppon@@ ents .
when they are pla@@ in@@ ly wrong , why let them off the hook ?
here we have had republicans critici@@ zing an increase in america ’ s budget deficit after doubling america ’ s national debt in the bush pres@@ iden@@ cy ’ s eight years .
moreover , republicans ’ belief that only tax cuts , not public spending , will delivery recovery is a sad example of blin@@ ker@@ ed ideology .
but there are more positive reasons for obama effort at bi@@ partis@@ ans@@ hip .
in any democratic system of checks and balances , leaders usually require co@@ ali@@ tions in order to get what they want done .
moreover , a con@@ sensu@@ al style is good politics .
most voters – certainly swing voters , who usually decide elections – do not like partisan bat@@ tles as much as some politicians and their suppor@@ ters do .
after all , the wise , the moder@@ ate , and the floating vot@@ er do not switch on the radio to listen to arch@@ conservatives like the american broad@@ ca@@ ster rush lim@@ baugh .
when things get tough in politics , as will happen in most of the world as we struggle with the impact of the global recession , every sensible government will try to hang on to the benefit of doubt .
it is the most important attribute in politics .
citizens know that running a country , especially in a time like this , is tough .
they are prepared to spare governments from too much criticism , if they think they are trying to do what is right for everyone .
they brid@@ le at a government that must do un@@ popular things and that also looks narrow and mean@@ -@@ spiri@@ ted .
there is also a lot to be said for making political argument more civil .
ronald reagan had a strong ideological bent .
he res@@ ha@@ ped american politics , pulling the center firmly to the right .
but he did so without ever seem@@ ing to des@@ p@@ ise his oppon@@ ents or dispar@@ age their intentions .
obama ’ s ai@@ des have conf@@ essed that he modeled his own election program on the sunny and optimistic dec@@ ency of the republican actor .
civili@@ ty in politics is not simply political con@@ fe@@ c@@ tion@@ ery .
a leader who respects his or her oppon@@ ents is more likely to earn respect himself than one who doub@@ ts their patrio@@ tism and res@@ ents their criticism .
one reason for the widespread respect felt for nelson mandela is that years of im@@ prison@@ ment did not em@@ bitter him .
ja@@ wa@@ har@@ l@@ al ne@@ hr@@ u was hugely popular because he was known to cher@@ ish free speech , take seriously the views of his cri@@ tics , and defend their right to disagree with him .
his role in establi@@ shing enduring democracy in india , despite the ten@@ sions of ca@@ ste , ethni@@ city , religion , and regional loy@@ alties , made him one of the to@@ wering figures of the twen@@ tieth century .
so my own hope is that obama will not be dis@@ su@@ aded from trying to work with his oppon@@ ents , to build consensus , and to deal cour@@ te@@ ously even with those whose views he may thorough@@ ly dis@@ like .
personally , i do not think that those whose philosophy de@@ pl@@ ores the whole idea of government , except when it is required to ba@@ il out businesses or banks , and who pur@@ port to offer a better future by stit@@ ching together the sh@@ re@@ ds and tat@@ ters of policies that helped produce today ’ s economic disaster , will have much respect or support from voters .
even in washington , there is not much to be said for being partisan , un@@ popular , and wrong .
new york – the finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ services industry has been under@@ going a revolution .
but the driving force is not over@@ hyp@@ ed block@@ chain applications such as bit@@ coin .
it is a revolution built on artificial intelligence , big data , and the internet of things .
already , thousands of real businesses are using these technologies to dis@@ rupt every aspect of financial inter@@ medi@@ ation .
dozens of online-@@ payment services – pa@@ ypal , ali@@ pay , wech@@ at pay , ven@@ mo , and so forth – have hundreds of millions of daily users .
and financial institutions are making precise len@@ ding decisions in seconds rather than weeks , thanks to a wealth of online data on individuals and firms .
with time , such dat@@ a-@@ driven improvements in credit allo@@ cation could even eliminate cycli@@ cal credi@@ t-@@ driven booms and bu@@ sts .
similarly , insurance under@@ writing , claims assessment and management , and frau@@ d monitoring have all become faster and more precise .
and actively managed portfoli@@ os are increasingly being replaced by passive robo@@ -@@ advis@@ ers , which can perform just as well or better than confli@@ cted , high-@@ fe@@ e financial advis@@ ers .
now , compare this real and ongoing fin@@ tech revolution with the record of block@@ chain , which has existed for almost a decade , and still has only one application : cryp@@ to@@ curren@@ cies .
block@@ chain ’ s boo@@ sters would argue that its early days resemble the early days of the internet , before it had commercial applications .
but that comparison is simply false .
whereas the internet quickly gave rise to email , the world wide web , and millions of viable commercial vent@@ ures used by billions of people , cryp@@ to@@ curren@@ cies such as bit@@ coin do not even fulfill their own stated purpose .
it is none of those things .
no one prices anything in bit@@ coin .
few re@@ tail@@ ers accept it .
and it is a poor store of value , because its price can fluctu@@ ate by 20-@@ 30 % in a single day .
worse , cryp@@ to@@ curren@@ cies in general are based on a false premise .
according to its promot@@ ers , bit@@ coin has a ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state supply of 21 million units , so it cannot be de@@ based like fi@@ at curren@@ cies .
but that claim is clearly frau@@ dul@@ ent , considering that it has already for@@ ked off into three branches : bit@@ coin cash , li@@ te@@ coin , and bit@@ coin gold .
besides , hundreds of other cryp@@ to@@ curren@@ cies are invented every day , alongside sc@@ ams known as “ initial coin off@@ er@@ ings , ” which are mostly designed to skir@@ t se@@ curi@@ ties laws .
so “ stable ” cryp@@ tos are creating money supply and de@@ bas@@ ing it at a much faster pace than any major central bank ever has .
as is typical of a financial bubble , investors are buying cryp@@ to@@ curren@@ cies not to use in trans@@ actions , but because they expect them to increase in value .
indeed , if someone actually wanted to use bit@@ coin , they would have a hard time doing so .
it is so energy-@@ intensive ( and thus environmentally toxic ) to produce , and carries such high trans@@ action costs , that even bit@@ coin conferences do not accept it as a valid form of payment .
until now , bit@@ coin ’ s only real use has been to facili@@ tate illegal activities such as drug trans@@ actions , tax ev@@ asion , avoi@@ dance of capital controls , or money la@@ under@@ ing .
not surprisingly , g@@ 20 member states are now working together to regulate cryp@@ to@@ curren@@ cies and eliminate the anony@@ mity they supposedly afford , by requ@@ ir@@ ing that all in@@ come@@ - or capit@@ al-@@ ga@@ in@@ s-@@ generating trans@@ actions be reported .
after a cra@@ ck@@ down by asian regul@@ ators this month , cryp@@ to@@ currency values fell by 50 % from their december peak .
they would have collapsed much more had a vast scheme to pro@@ p up their price via ou@@ tri@@ ght manipulation not been rapidly implemented .
but , like in the case of the sub-@@ prime bubble , most us regul@@ ators are still asleep at the wheel .
since the invention of money thousands of years ago , there has never been a mon@@ etary system with hundreds of different curren@@ cies operating alongside one another .
the entire point of money is that it allows parties to trans@@ act without having to bar@@ ter .
but for money to have value , and to generate economies of scale , only so many curren@@ cies can operate at the same time .
in the us , the reason we do not use euros or yen in addition to dollars is obvious : doing so would be poin@@ tless , and it would make the economy far less efficient .
the idea that hundreds of cryp@@ to@@ curren@@ cies could vi@@ ably operate together not only contradi@@ cts the very concept of money ; it is utterly i@@ dio@@ tic .
but so , too , is the idea that even a single cryp@@ to@@ currency could substitute for fi@@ at money .
cryp@@ to@@ curren@@ cies have no intrinsic value , whereas fi@@ at curren@@ cies certainly do , because they can be used to pay taxes .
fi@@ at curren@@ cies are also protected from value de@@ basement by central banks committed to price stability ; and if a fi@@ at currency loses credi@@ bility , as in some weak mon@@ etary systems with high inflation , it will be swa@@ pped out for more stable foreign fi@@ at curren@@ cies or real assets .
as it happens , bit@@ coin ’ s supposed advantage is also its achilles ’ s heel , because even if it actually did have a ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state supply of 21 million units , that would dis@@ quali@@ fy it as a viable currency .
unless the supply of a currency tracks potential nomin@@ al gdp , prices will under@@ go def@@ lation .
that means if a ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state supply of bit@@ coin really did gradually replace a fi@@ at currency , the price index of all goods and services would continuously fall .
by extension , any nomin@@ al debt contract denomin@@ ated in bit@@ coin would rise in real value over time , leading to the kind of debt def@@ lation that economist ir@@ ving fisher believed precipit@@ ated the great depression .
at the same time , nomin@@ al wages in bit@@ coin would increase forever in real terms , regardless of productivity growth , adding further to the likelihood of an economic disaster .
clearly , bit@@ coin and other cryp@@ to@@ curren@@ cies represent the mother of all bubbles , which explains why every human being i met between thanksgiving and christmas of 20@@ 17 asked me if they should buy them .
sc@@ am@@ mers , s@@ wind@@ lers , char@@ lat@@ ans , and carni@@ val bar@@ kers ( all confli@@ cted insi@@ ders ) have tapped into clu@@ eless retail investors ’ f@@ om@@ o ( “ fear of missing out ” ) , and taken them for a ride .
as for the underlying block@@ chain technology , there are still massive obstacles standing in its way , even if it has more potential than cryp@@ to@@ curren@@ cies .
chief among them is that it lac@@ ks the kind of basic common and universal proto@@ col@@ s that made the internet univers@@ ally accessible ( t@@ c@@ p-@@ ip , ht@@ ml , and so forth ) .
more fundamentally , its promise of decentralized trans@@ actions with no inter@@ medi@@ ary authority amounts to an un@@ tested , utop@@ ian pi@@ pe@@ dream .
no wonder block@@ chain is ran@@ ked close to the peak of the hype cycle of technologies with in@@ fl@@ ated expectations .
so , forget about block@@ chain , bit@@ coin , and other cryp@@ to@@ curren@@ cies , and start investing in fin@@ tech firms with actual business models , which are slo@@ gging away to revolution@@ ize the finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ services industry .
you won ’ t get rich overnight ; but you ’ ll have made the smarter investment .
did the bankers do it ?
new delhi – few areas of economic activity in the united states are more politi@@ ci@@ zed than housing finance .
yet the intellectual left has gone to great l@@ engths to ab@@ solve regul@@ ators , government len@@ ding mand@@ ates , and agencies like fan@@ nie ma@@ e and fre@@ d@@ die mac of any responsibility for the housing boom and the subsequ@@ ent bust .
the rationale is clear : if these officials , institutions , and policies were held accountable , the reform agenda would necessarily shift from regul@@ ating gree@@ dy bankers and their bon@@ uses to asking broader questions .
might government mand@@ ates contribute to bad behavior by private players ?
can regul@@ ators be trusted to make appropriate trade-offs between financial stability and mand@@ ates that have wide political support ?
indeed , can central bankers be truly independent ?
un@@ questioning acceptance of a greater government role in tam@@ ing markets would , in short , give way to asking whether that role can sometimes be part of the problem .
the left has had an easy task in domin@@ ating the debate , partly because the intellectual right ’ s attempt to place all the blame for the crisis on government is thorough@@ ly im@@ plau@@ sible .
it is far more defen@@ sible and correct to argue that everyone – bankers , households , regul@@ ators , and politicians – contributed to ( and took credit for ) the boom while it lasted , only to point fingers at one another when it collapsed .
but bankers ’ political tin ear in the after@@ math of the crisis – first taking public bail@@ outs and then paying themselves huge bon@@ uses as if nothing had changed – en@@ su@@ red that they got the lion ’ s share of the blame , with everyone else willing to pose as their un@@ wi@@ tting victims .
as a result , the publi@@ c-@@ policy response has been dominated by “ the bankers did it ” narrative .
the risk is that this approach is incomplete – and thus unlikely to be effective .
it is therefore re@@ fres@@ hing to see a careful econom@@ et@@ ric study take on an asser@@ tion by paul kru@@ gman , perhaps the most influential left-@@ lean@@ ing us economist , that “ the community rein@@ vest@@ ment act of 1977 was irrelevant to the sub@@ prime boom . ”
the cr@@ a instru@@ cts federal financial super@@ vis@@ ory agencies to encourage the institutions that they regulate to help the communities in which they are char@@ tered to meet their credit needs , while also con@@ forming to “ safe and sound ” standards .
in practice , regul@@ ators measure the volume of len@@ ding to cr@@ a target tra@@ cts – poor areas with medi@@ an income less than 80 % of the medi@@ an income of the local community – as well as to low-income and minority bor@@ ro@@ wers in non-@@ cr@@ a tra@@ cts to veri@@ fy compli@@ ance with the act .
the left has dis@@ missed any claim that the cr@@ a played a role in the housing boom by pointing out that it was en@@ acted in 1977 , while the sub@@ prime boom played out in the early 2000 ’ s .
but this ignor@@ es the possibility that regul@@ ators may have started to en@@ force the cr@@ a rigor@@ ously only later .
to en@@ force the stat@@ ute , regul@@ ators perio@@ di@@ cally examine banks for cr@@ a compli@@ ance .
to h@@ one in on the “ regul@@ atory en@@ for@@ cement ” effect , the recent study compar@@ es the behavior of banks that are under@@ going exam@@ ination ( which takes place over several quarters ) to that of banks that are not under@@ going exam@@ ination in a particular tra@@ ct in a particular month .
the findings are clear .
compared to banks that are not under@@ going exam@@ ination , the volume of loans by banks in the six quarters surrounding a cr@@ a exam@@ ination is 5 % higher , and these loans are 15 % more likely to be del@@ in@@ qu@@ ent one year after origin@@ ation .
in other words , banks under@@ going exam@@ ination l@@ end more and make riski@@ er loans – and these findings are even more pronoun@@ ced in cra@@ -@@ eli@@ gible tra@@ cts .
good econom@@ et@@ ric studies examine secondary effects to persuade readers that the main effect is what it is .
regul@@ ators ’ primary tool to en@@ force compli@@ ance was their authority to reject non-@@ cra@@ -@@ compli@@ ant banks ’ requests for new branches or mer@@ gers .
during the sub@@ prime boom , large banks were more likely to want to expand , and thus had greater incentive to comp@@ ly .
the study finds that cr@@ a len@@ ding by larger banks does indeed respond more to a cr@@ a exam@@ ination .
at the height of the len@@ ding fren@@ zy ( 200@@ 4-@@ 2006 ) , the study finds that banks lo@@ an@@ ed even more in response to an exam@@ ination , and that the outcomes were even worse .
the authors specu@@ late that easier loan se@@ curi@@ tization may have made risky cra@@ -@@ compli@@ ant loans seem less costly .
finally , like all good studies , this one explains why the authors more careful analysis produces results that differ from those in previous studies .
because of the way it is structured , the study only suggests a lower bound on the effects of cr@@ a compli@@ ance .
it focuses on the differential impact of the cr@@ a on banks under@@ going exam@@ ination and those not under@@ going exam@@ ination .
in fact , all banks are likely to have upp@@ ed their cra@@ -@@ compli@@ ant len@@ ding .
the study cannot measure this increase .
there is room in economics for grand specu@@ lation – some part intuition , some part common sense , and some part ideology .
if economists were to wait for careful studies before offering opinions about policy , we would never have anything tim@@ ely to say .
and it is certainly better to have some economic intuition gui@@ ding policy than none at all .
but there is a danger that the public mistakes specu@@ lation for truth , only because of the spe@@ cul@@ ator ’ s cre@@ denti@@ als and asser@@ tiveness .
studies like this one are useful in setting the record straight .
we must recognize that in the desire to bro@@ aden home ownership , essential checks and balances broke down .
households , politicians , and regul@@ ators were also complic@@ it .
as we go about the process of reform , we should bear in mind that the only thing worse than fighting the last war is fighting the wrong last war .
why border walls fail
hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u – call this the year of border walls .
in 2015 , est@@ onia , hung@@ ary , kenya , saudi arabia , and tunisia all announced or began the construction of barriers on their frontiers .
we may live in an era of globalization , but much of the world is increasingly focused on limit@@ ing the free movement of people .
at the end of world war ii , there were only five border walls around the world .
today , according to elisabeth val@@ let of the university of que@@ be@@ c at mon@@ tre@@ al , there are 65 , three-@@ quarters of them built in the past 20 years .
and in the united states , republican presidential candidates are promising more .
the republican fron@@ trun@@ ner , don@@ ald trum@@ p , has repeatedly proposed building a wall along the entire border with mexico .
and on a sunday morning talk show , another republican candidate , wisconsin governor scott walker , described building a wall on the us-@@ canada border as “ a legitimate issue for us to look at . ”
and yet existing border walls are neither cheap nor effective .
israel ’ s wall in the west bank cost more than $ 1 million per mile to construct .
according to us cust@@ oms and border protection , building and maintaining the existing 6@@ 70 miles of border fen@@ cing on the us-@@ mexico border would cost $ 6.@@ 5 billion over the barrier ’ s expected 20-@@ year life cycle .
at this price , for@@ ti@@ fying the remaining 1,@@ 300 miles of the mexico border would cost more than $ 12@@ .@@ 6 billion .
erec@@ ting a wall along the 5,@@ 5@@ 25-@@ mile border with canada would cost almost $ 50 billion and would cut through an airport run@@ way , an opera house , homes , and businesses that currently stra@@ ddle the border .
nor is there much evidence that border walls work as intended .
to be sure , prisons demonstrate that short , well-@@ guar@@ ded walls can be extremely effective at preventing movement .
but even prison walls are only as effective as the guards who ensure that they are not bre@@ ached , and guards can be susceptible to bribes .
the recent escape of the drug car@@ tel leader jo@@ aqu@@ in “ el chap@@ o ” gu@@ z@@ man from a mexican prison high@@ lights another vulnerability of border walls : tunnels .
since 1990 , the us border pat@@ ro@@ l has found 150 tunnels beneath the us-@@ mexico border .
those with money will always be able to cross borders using fake documents , bribes , or innovative infrastructure .
indeed , for@@ ti@@ fied frontiers are most effective at stopping poor migr@@ ants and refugees .
and even then , rather than preventing migr@@ ants from entering , for@@ tifi@@ cations all too often fun@@ nel them toward more dangerous crossing points .
the result is a moun@@ ting toll of predictable deaths .
the international organization for migration estimates that from 2005 to 20@@ 14 , some 40,000 people died attemp@@ ting to cross a border .
unlike prison peri@@ meters , borders can be thousands of miles long , which makes them difficult to monitor properly .
the us emplo@@ ys more than 20,000 border pat@@ ro@@ l agents ; but even if they were all on duty at the same time , each would need to guard a 1,@@ 70@@ 0-@@ foot section of the border .
of course , equipment like cameras , motion sensors , dr@@ ones , helicop@@ ters , and vehicles allow agents to watch long sections of the border .
but the necessi@@ ty of monitoring border walls points to one of the fundamental truths about them : historically , most have proved to be pretty useless .
the most famous sections of the great wall of china were over@@ run within a few decades of their construction .
when germany invaded france in w@@ wi@@ i , it simply went around the magin@@ ot line .
the berlin wall fell within 30 years of its construction .
indeed , border guards and their equipment can be equally effective without a physical barrier .
at best , walls and f@@ ences only slow people down , making them a poor investment from a security standpoint .
they are similarly in@@ effective from a military perspective .
missi@@ les and airplanes can fly over them and tanks can s@@ mash through them .
and yet , despite their high cost and low efficacy , walls remain popular among policymakers and politicians .
they provide im@@ pos@@ ingly tangible evidence that something is being done about migration .
high-tech surveillance and boots on the ground may be more effective at preventing people from crossing a border , but a wall can be used as a political pro@@ p .
if trum@@ p ever builds his wall , he should build a really nice one , like the great wall of china .
then one day it might become a popular tourist attraction – and finally serve a useful purpose .
paris – who would have thought it ?
there they were , brazi@@ li@@ ans , prote@@ sting outside football stadi@@ ums against their country ho@@ sting the world cup in 20@@ 14 – and this even as their national team was thr@@ ash@@ ing spain in the final of the con@@ feder@@ ations cup .
it was as if catho@@ lic@@ s were to protest outside the va@@ ti@@ can against picking a new pope .
what cu@@ is@@ ine is to the french , soccer is to brazi@@ li@@ ans : a matter of the highest national pride .
regardless of their economic , racial , or political differences , all brazi@@ li@@ ans are upli@@ fted by having the best team in the world , winning the world cup many times , and inventing and reinventing “ the beautiful game . ”
st@@ aging the next world cup in brazil , as well as the olympic games in 20@@ 16 , even though the football tour@@ nam@@ ent alone will cost up to $ 13 billion , seems a logical move .
so what poss@@ essed the 19@@ -year-old brazilian male who told reporters : “ we don ’ t need the world cup .
we need education , better health services , more humane police . ” many people feel the same way .
have millions of brazi@@ li@@ ans suddenly lost their passion for the game ?
if so , it is not the game itself that they have for@@ sa@@ ken , but rather the kind of game that football has become : a billion-@@ dollar business , a prestige object for lou@@ che pluto@@ crats , and an extra@@ va@@ gan@@ t show@@ piece for corrupt governments and international sporting organizations .
football was once a popular sport , rooted in local communities .
local work@@ ing-@@ class boys played for local clubs that inspired fier@@ ce loyalty among fans .
some clubs were finan@@ ced by industrial corporations in order to promote loyalty among their workers : philips sponsored the dutch club ps@@ v ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , for example , while fi@@ at played the same role for italy ’ s ju@@ vent@@ us .
but , regardless of the sponsor@@ ship or the location , fans felt close to most of the clubs , as well as to their national teams .
they were part of people ’ s “ identity . ”
this is still true to some extent , but something crucial has changed : football , like other types of commerce , has gone global .
thanks to new ownership rules , cable television , product end@@ or@@ se@@ ments , and other business-@@ related factors , there are probably more suppor@@ ters of manchester united in china than there are in the united kingdom , let alone in the city of manchester .
football teams are now like multinational franch@@ ises , with co@@ aches and players from all over the world .
but this alone does not account for the kind of ali@@ en@@ ation from the game expressed by the brazilian prote@@ sters .
the worldwide reach of football was prece@@ ded by that of the olympic games , and it is here where we should turn to understand the corruption of globalized sports .
unlike football , the olympics were always closely associated with elites : amateur athletes recru@@ ited from universities , and so on . the father of the modern olympic games , bar@@ on de cour@@ ber@@ tin , was a french ari@@ sto@@ crat who promot@@ ed sports to rein@@ vi@@ gor@@ ate the men of france after their defeat in the fran@@ co-@@ pr@@ us@@ si@@ an war of 18@@ 71 .
his aim for the olympic games was to em@@ body a noble ideal of world peace and bro@@ ther@@ hood through athle@@ tic competition .
how easily this ideal could be corrup@@ ted by distin@@ ctly ung@@ entle@@ man@@ ly politics was already clear in 193@@ 6 , when cou@@ ber@@ tin ’ s dod@@ dering speech about peace and fair play was played over the lou@@ d@@ speakers of the olympic stadium in berlin , while hitler and his hen@@ ch@@ men raised their arms to sal@@ ute the nazi flag .
but even without no@@ is@@ ome politics , the sheer amount of money required to stage the olympic games – the building contracts for stadi@@ ums , transport infrastructure , and hotels , together with all the other commercial ra@@ zz@@ ma@@ ta@@ zz – was bound to produce a culture of bri@@ bery and kick@@ backs .
an international elite of olympic officials arose , living in a self-@@ contained bubble of wealth and privilege .
i once had occasion to watch these men as they tro@@ oped in and out of first-@@ class hotels in an asian capital , sle@@ ek figures in gol@@ d-@@ butt@@ oned bla@@ zers .
it was striking to see how often the most prosper@@ ous@@ -@@ looking representatives came from the world ’ s poorest countries .
football is now like the olympics ( or formula 1 racing ) , except that even more money is involved .
football clubs have become the status symbols of newly rich ty@@ co@@ ons from russia or the middle east , and international competi@@ tions , especially the world cup , have become occasi@@ ons to bol@@ ster the prestige , and sometimes even the legiti@@ macy , of national governments .
such events rein@@ force the tendency of modern political regimes , dictator@@ ships as well as democracies , to measure themselves in monum@@ ental building projects – giant new stadi@@ ums , gar@@ gan@@ tu@@ an shopping m@@ alls , huge conference halls – which are sometimes needed , but often are not .
as a result , developers , architects , politicians , ty@@ co@@ ons , and international sporting officials are now in charge of the beautiful game .
this adds to their power , wealth , and prestige .
but once they have sta@@ ged their spectac@@ les , at vast expense to the host country , they move on .
this is especially gall@@ ing in countries where much of the population is poor and depri@@ ved of decent schools or proper medical services .
millions of brazi@@ li@@ ans have made clear where their priorities lie .
they haven ’ t fallen out of love with football .
on the contrary , by prote@@ sting against the gro@@ tes@@ que manipulation of the modern game , they are trying to take it back .
cambridge – last month , china ’ s new president , x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping , chose moscow for his first foreign visit .
he and russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin announced a number of agre@@ ements and then traveled to dur@@ ban , south africa , for the fifth “ bri@@ cs ” summit , where they joined with the leaders of india , brazil , and south africa to announce the creation of a new development bank that could challenge the dominance of the world bank and the international mon@@ etary fund .
the five leaders ’ speeches referred to a shifting world order , and x@@ i said “ the potential of bri@@ cs development is infinite . ”
it looked as if the bri@@ cs had finally come of age .
three years ago , i was skeptical about the bri@@ cs .
and , despite the recent summit ’ s apparent success , i still am .
nearly 12 years ago , jim o ’ nei@@ ll , then the chief economist for goldman sachs , coined the term “ bri@@ c ” to describe the “ emerging markets ” of brazil , russia , india , and china .
from 2000 to 2008 , these four countries ’ share of global output rose rapidly , from 16 % to 22 % ( in purchasing power par@@ ity terms ) , and their economies performed better than average in the subsequ@@ ent global recession .
for investors , that outcome justi@@ fied the creation of the cat@@ chy acronym .
but then a strange thing happened : the investors ’ creature came to life .
in 2009 , the four countries met for the first time in russia in an effort to for@@ ge an international political organization .
south africa joined the blo@@ c in late 2010 primarily for political reasons .
as o ’ nei@@ ll recently told china daily , “ south africa is quite fortunate enough to be in the group , as , economically , it is rather small compared to the others . ” moreover , its economic performance has been relatively slu@@ g@@ g@@ ish , with a growth rate of just 2.@@ 3 % last year .
indeed , while the bri@@ cs may be helpful in coordin@@ ating certain diplo@@ matic tactics , the term lum@@ ps together highly disparate countries .
not only is south africa min@@ is@@ cule compared to the others , but china ’ s economy is larger than those of all of the other members combined .
likewise , india , brazil , and south africa are democracies , and occasionally meet in an alternative forum that they call “ i@@ bs@@ a . ”
and , while the large auto@@ cra@@ cies , russia and china , find it diplo@@ matically advanta@@ geous to t@@ weak the americans , both have different but crucial relationships with the united states .
and both have worked to th@@ wart efforts by india , brazil , and south africa to become permanent members of the united nations security council .
as i wrote three years ago , in analytical terms , it makes little sense to include russia , a former superpower , with the developing economies .
russia lac@@ ks diversi@@ fied exports , faces severe demographic and health problems , and , in former president d@@ mit@@ ri med@@ ve@@ de@@ v ’ s words , “ greatly needs moderni@@ zation . ”
little has changed since pu@@ tin returned to the pres@@ iden@@ cy last year .
while economic growth benef@@ ited from the dramatic growth in oil and gas prices during the last decade , other competitive industries have yet to emerge , and the country now faces the prospect of declining energy prices .
while it aims to maintain 5 % annual growth , its economy was relatively flat last year .
if russia ’ s power resources seem to be declining , brazil ’ s appear to be more impressive , given it has a territory nearly three times the size of india ’ s , a 90 % literacy rate , and triple the per capita income of india ( and nearly twice that of china ) .
but , in the three years since my earlier assessment , brazil ’ s performance has sli@@ pped : annual economic growth has slowed from 7.@@ 5 % in 2010 to 1 % last year , with a 3.5 % rate expected in 2013 .
unless it improves its infrastructure and literacy rate ( particularly for women ) , india is unlikely to catch up with china .
so , should we take today ’ s bri@@ cs more seriously than the bri@@ cs of three years ago ?
that lack of unity is symp@@ to@@ matic of the bri@@ cs members ’ underlying in@@ compati@@ bilities .
in political terms , china , india , and russia are v@@ ying with each other for power in asia .
and , in economic terms , brazil , india , and south africa are concerned about the effects of china ’ s under@@ valued currency on their economies .
three years ago , i wrote that , “ bri@@ c is not likely to become a serious political organization of like@@ -@@ minded states . ”
the bri@@ cs ’ most recent meeting has given me no reason to re@@ v@@ ise that assessment .
why capital flows uph@@ ill
london – at first , it seems difficult to grasp : global capital is flowing from poor to rich countries .
emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market countries run curr@@ ent-@@ account sur@@ pl@@ uses , while advanced economies have defic@@ its .
one would expect fast-@@ growing , capit@@ al-@@ scarce ( and young ) developing countries to be impor@@ ting capital from the rest of world to finance consumption and investment .
so , why are they sending capital to richer countries , instead ?
china is a case in point .
with its curr@@ ent-@@ account surplus aver@@ aging 5.@@ 5 % of gdp in 200@@ 0-@@ 2008 , china has become one of the world ’ s largest len@@ ders .
despite its rapid growth and promising investment opportunities , the country has persi@@ stently been sending a significant portion of its savings overseas .
and china is not alone .
other emerging markets – including brazil , russia , india , mexico , argentina , thailand , indonesia , malaysia , and the middle eastern oil expor@@ ters – have all increased their curr@@ ent-@@ account sur@@ pl@@ uses significantly since the early 1990 ’ s .
collectively , capit@@ al-@@ scarce developing countries are len@@ ding to capit@@ al-@@ abundant advanced economies .
many obser@@ vers believe that these global im@@ balances reflect developing economies ’ financial integration , coupled with under@@ development of domestic financial markets .
according to this view , these countries ’ demand for assets cannot be met – in terms of both quantity and quality – at home , so they deploy part of their savings to countries like the us , which can offer a more diverse array of quality assets .
while plau@@ sible , this argument suggests that , as financial markets improve over time in developing countries , the global im@@ balances are bound to shrink .
but such a rever@@ sal is nowhere in sight .
why ?
a crucial dimension of globalization has been trade liber@@ alization .
for china , foreign trade as a percentage of gdp so@@ ared from 25 % in 1989 to 66 % in 2006 , largely o@@ wing to its ad@@ mission to the world trade organization in 2001 .
most of what china and other developing countries produce and export are labor@@ -@@ intensive goods such as tex@@ tiles and appar@@ el .
this has allowed advanced economies , in turn , to produce and export more capit@@ al-@@ intensive , hig@@ her@@ -@@ valu@@ e-@@ added products .
globalization of trade enabled countries to tap the efficiency gains that specialization in their sectors of compar@@ ative advantage has brought about .
with a slight mental stretch , one can imagine that what a country produces and tra@@ des may affect its savings and investment decisions .
an economy in which the main productive activity is berry picking , for example , has little need for investment and capital accumulation .
its labor@@ ers earn wages , consume , and save part of that income .
since the production process requires little capital , there is no demand for domestic investment – and thus no savings vehicles .
instead , the only way to save is by purchasing capital abroad – in economies with capit@@ al-@@ intensive production and demand for investment .
this economy will always export its savings .
that may be an extreme example , but it illustrates a more general point about how mer@@ chand@@ ise trade can influence financial flows .
countries that produce and export more labor@@ -@@ intensive goods – perhaps o@@ wing to increased trade openness , or faster labor@@ -@@ force and productivity growth , all of which are true of china – may experience a rise in saving , but a less@@ -@@ than@@ -@@ equivalent increase in demand for capital .
rich countries , by contrast , are able to export more capit@@ al-@@ intensive goods , and thus have a greater need for investment .
so they may be impor@@ ting more capital – resul@@ ting in a greater curr@@ ent-@@ account deficit – simply because they are producing more capit@@ al-@@ intensive goods .
with developing countries – in particular , china , india , and the ex-@@ soviet blo@@ c – bringing almost 1.5 billion workers into the world economy since the early 1990 ’ s , it is not difficult to understand the potential impact of this effect .
after all , much of this labor force was absorbed by labor@@ -@@ intensive industries that eventually chur@@ ned out products expor@@ ted to the rest of the world .
indeed , that massive addition of labor helped to drive down the relative price of labor@@ -@@ intensive goods , which fell by roughly 15 % between 1989 and 2008 .
as developing countries increased their labor@@ -@@ intensive production and exports , their curr@@ ent-@@ account sur@@ pl@@ uses rose – by almost 3.@@ 6 percentage points , on average , between 198@@ 9@@ -@@ 1993 and 200@@ 2-@@ 2006 .
china ’ s curr@@ ent-@@ account surplus increased by almost 11 percentage points over the same period , india ’ s by 2.5 percentage points , and russia ’ s by seven percentage points .
these countries , as well as other large surplus economies , such as brazil , saudi arabia , and iran , all experienced a simul@@ taneous increase in the labor content of exports .
this pattern contra@@ sts with that of the united states and many other advanced countries , which have experienced a de@@ terior@@ ation of their curr@@ ent-@@ account balances as their production and exports have become more capit@@ al-@@ intensive .
many might doubt the view that china is expor@@ ting more labor@@ -@@ intensive goods , rather than up@@ gra@@ ding its exports on the capit@@ al@@ - and sk@@ ill-@@ intensity ladder .
but trade data suggest the opposite , perhaps because china ’ s acc@@ ession to the w@@ to led to tari@@ ff reduc@@ tions that released more labor@@ -@@ intensive production .
in fact , trade data may underestimate the true extent of china ’ s labor intensity an@@ do@@ ver@@ state the capital and skill intensity of china ’ s exports .
china has witnessed rapid growth in the processing trade : assembling inter@@ mediate inputs – impor@@ ted from countries like the us and japan – that have high capital and skill content .
so , while the exports of these final goods may count towards china ’ s own capital and skill content , the country ’ s real role was only in the labor@@ -@@ intensive process of assembly .
a country ’ s production structure may very well determine how much capital it supplies and how much it needs .
so the fact that capital may flow towards rich countries that produce and export more capit@@ al-@@ intensive goods should not be so puzz@@ ling , after all .

in a rehear@@ sal studio , a young cu@@ ban ballet dancer turns through the air , pi@@ voting as though some invisible power has un@@ fur@@ led him in an arc .

welcome to cuba , a country that dazz@@ les and disap@@ points , where one finds miracles and monsters , but no easy answers .
cu@@ b@@ ans recognize the contradi@@ ctions as readily as any outsi@@ der .
yet even as inflation rises and the 7@@ 7@@ -year-old dictator ti@@ gh@@ tens internet access and clo@@ ses the economic open@@ ings that encouraged self-@@ employment in the mid-@@ 1990 &apos;s , it is unlikely that cu@@ b@@ ans will turn ca@@ stro out before he dies .
the rab@@ i@@ dly anti-@@ ca@@ stro cu@@ ban ex@@ iles clu@@ stered in miami argue that it is fear that holds cu@@ b@@ ans back , but that &apos;s not true .
a visit@@ or in cuba finds many ready to complain , but the pal@@ pable fear and visceral hatred ramp@@ ant in el sal@@ v@@ ad@@ or and chile in the 1980 &apos;s is ab@@ sent in today &apos;s cuba .
instead there is a kind of paralysis - born of a mix of loyalty , fear , and in@@ doc@@ trin@@ ation - as they gru@@ d@@ g@@ ingly wait for ca@@ stro to ex@@ pi@@ re .
so , unlike the east europeans who over@@ threw their corrupt political leaders in 1989 , and some latin americans who did so more recently in boli@@ via , argentina , and ecuador , cu@@ b@@ ans have failed to r@@ ally against ca@@ stro .
yes , ca@@ stro ja@@ iled 75 independent journalists and others in an april swe@@ ep - that is the monster in him .
but other dissi@@ dents remain free .
that is the contradiction .
moreover , unlike other lux@@ ur@@ y-@@ loving latin american leaders , cu@@ ban officials do not fla@@ unt la@@ vis@@ h lifest@@ y@@ les .
among latin american countries , only chile and uruguay rate better than cuba in transparency international &apos;s corruption index .
but this could change as dollars become hard to resist and cu@@ b@@ ans use them to cut through ridiculous bureau@@ cratic hur@@ d@@ les .
already , the dollar has created a divide in living standards between those who have green@@ backs and those who don &apos;t .
despite a mor@@ ib@@ und economy , ca@@ stro still delivers what the majority of latin american residents fail to get - free health care and education and a relatively dru@@ g@@ - and cri@@ me-@@ free environment .
with more than 40 % of latin america &apos;s population living in poverty , cuba stands out as an example of a country where being poor does not mean a life of squ@@ al@@ or .
even world bank president james wol@@ fen@@ sohn acknowled@@ ged in 2001 that cuba had done a &quot; great job &quot; on education and health care .
more recently , in discussing the bank &apos;s 2004 report making services work for poor people , officials put cuba among countries like sri lanka , costa rica , and china that &quot; managed to achieve a level of outcomes in health and education that are extremely favor@@ able . &quot;
this winter , the cu@@ ban government rein@@ vest@@ ed some of its income from tourism in up@@ gra@@ ding schools that de@@ terior@@ ated in the years following the loss of soviet aid . &quot; cu@@ b@@ ans are still ende@@ ared by that , &quot; said one western diplomat .
amazingly , many latin america leaders fail to make the connection between reducing poverty and their own popul@@ arity .
compare ca@@ stro &apos;s campaign to improve schools to a poverty reduction program wa@@ ged by mexico &apos;s institutional revolutionary party during a six-@@ year period in the 1990 &apos;s .
mexico spent 1.2 % of gdp per year to provide basic services to communities in mexico .
according to santa de@@ ver@@ a@@ jan , the director of the world bank &apos;s world development report 2004 , some studies showed that the program could have reduced poverty by as much as 64 % .
instead , the money was dol@@ ed out to munici@@ p@@ alities based on political loyalty , so poverty fell by only 3 % . &quot; if they had just given it out equally to the entire mexican population , &quot; de@@ ver@@ a@@ jan says , &quot; it would have reduced poverty by 13 % . &quot;
examples like this abo@@ und in latin america , but it is a mistake for ca@@ stro to think that latin america is the competition .
cu@@ b@@ ans don &apos;t think it is .
their touch@@ stones are ma@@ dri@@ d , paris , and new york .
an educated professional with a wife and two children takes a breath when he rec@@ alls a trip to spain . &quot; it &apos;s hard to explain how i felt when i went there .

with family in spain , he could im@@ migrate , but he doesn &apos;t consider that option seriously . &quot; this is where i want to live , but 5 % of the way things are run has got to change .
they blame everything on the embar@@ go .
we have a self-@@ imposed embar@@ go .
we limit ourselves . &quot;
more precisely , ca@@ stro limits cu@@ b@@ ans .
they want to breathe , but life with a patri@@ arch@@ al ty@@ rant can be suff@@ oc@@ ating .
younger cu@@ b@@ ans often sound like well-@@ educated teenagers with parents who are too strict .
they want to travel , publish what they want , dance when and where they want , and experience the world as ca@@ stro experienced it .
&quot; it &apos;s not my fight , &quot; says one 2@@ 8@@ -year-old cu@@ ban , refer@@ ring to the political battle of communism versus capitalism that keeps him trapped on the island . &quot; i &apos;m a new generation .

why china can ’ t adjust
clar@@ em@@ on@@ t , california – china ’ s current economic slow@@ down has no shortage of causes : europe ’ s financial tur@@ mo@@ il , spu@@ tter@@ ing recovery in the united states , and weak domestic investment growth , to name the most commonly c@@ ited factors .
since exports and investment account , respe@@ ctively , for 30 % and 40 % of china ’ s gdp growth , its economy is particularly vulnerable to weak@@ ening external demand and accumulation of non-@@ performing loans caused by exc@@ essive and waste@@ ful spending on fixed assets .
but china ’ s vulnerability to these factors , as serious as they are , is symp@@ to@@ matic of deeper institutional problems .
until these underlying constraints are addressed , talk of a new consu@@ mp@@ tion-@@ based growth model for china , reflected in the government ’ s recently approved 12th five-@@ year plan , can be no more than lip service .
after all , china ’ s major trading partners , international financial institutions such as the world bank and the international mon@@ etary fund , and senior chinese officials themselves have long recognized the structural vulner@@ abilities caused by exc@@ essive investment and low household consumption .
and , for nearly a decade , china has been ur@@ ged to under@@ take reforms to red@@ ress these economic patterns , which have under@@ min@@ ed the welfare of ordinary chinese and stra@@ ined the global trading system .
the best-@@ known feature of china ’ s macro@@ economic im@@ balances is heavy dependence on exports for growth , which is typically attribu@@ ted to weak domestic demand : as a middle-@@ income country , china lac@@ ks the purchasing power to consume the goods that it produces .
with nearly unlimited access to advan@@ ce@@ d-@@ country markets , china can tap into global external demand and raise its gdp growth potential , as it has done for the past two decades .
if this view is right , the solution is straightforward : china can correct its im@@ balances by increasing its citizens ’ incomes ( by cutting taxes , raising wages , or increasing social spending ) , so that they can consume more , thereby reducing the economy ’ s dependence on exports .
indeed , nearly all mainstream economists prescribe this approach for china .
but there is another explanation for china ’ s exc@@ essive export dependence , one that has more to do with the country ’ s poor political and economic institutions .
specifically , export dependence partly reflects the high degree of difficulty of doing business in china .
official corruption , insecure property rights , sti@@ fl@@ ing regul@@ atory restra@@ ints , weak payment discipline , poor logi@@ stics and distribution , widespread counter@@ fei@@ ting , and vulnerability to other forms of intellec@@ tu@@ al-@@ property theft : all of these obstacles increase trans@@ action costs and make it difficult for entrepreneurs to thrive in domestic markets .
by contrast , if china ’ s private firms sell to western multination@@ als , such as wal-mart , target , or home de@@ pot , they do not have to worry about getting paid .
they can avoid all of the headaches that they would have encountered at home , because well-@@ established economic institutions and business practices in their export markets protect their interests and greatly reduce trans@@ action costs .
the chinese economy ’ s institutional weakness is reflected in international survey data .
in its june 2011 survey , china was ran@@ ked 9@@ 1@@ st , behind mon@@ goli@@ a , alb@@ ania , and bel@@ ar@@ us .
faced with such a hostile environment , chinese private entrepreneurs have been forced to engage in “ institutional arbit@@ rage ” – taking advantage of efficient western economic institutions to expand their business ( most ex@@ port-@@ oriented businesses are owned by private entrepreneurs and foreign firms ) .
unfortunately , as china has already cla@@ imed a large share of the world ’ s mer@@ chand@@ ise exports ( 10@@ .@@ 4 % in 2010 ) and economic stag@@ nation in the west is constra@@ ining external demand , this strategy can no longer work .
but re@@ ori@@ enting their businesses toward the chinese domestic market requires far more than government policies that put more money in consumers &apos; pockets .
in order to enjoy the same low trans@@ action costs that they have in expor@@ ting , china ’ s entrepreneurs need a much better business environment : an effective legal system , a sound regul@@ atory framework , a government that protects their brands by fighting intellec@@ tu@@ al-@@ property theft , depen@@ dable logi@@ stics and distribution networks , and a gra@@ ft-@@ resistant bureaucracy .
china cannot create such an environment quickly .
in essence , the chinese government must transform a predat@@ ory state into a nurturing one , and treat private entrepreneurs as creators of wealth rather than targets of extra@@ ction .
in nearly all other countries , such a transformation was accomplished by establi@@ shing the rule of law and / or moving from auto@@ cracy to democracy .
the im@@ possibility of sustaining growth in the absence of the rule of law and political accountability presents the chinese communist party with an existential dilemma .
ever since it crushed the pro-@@ democracy movement in ti@@ an@@ an@@ men square in 1989 , the party has vo@@ wed not to sur@@ render its political monopoly .
the investment boom and the globalization divi@@ dend of the last two decades allowed the party to have its cake and eat it – maintaining its rule on the basis of economic prosperity , while failing to establish the institutions critical to sustaining such prosperity .
today , this is no longer possible .
so in a sense , the chinese bubble – as much an intellectual and political bubble as an economic one – has burst .
as china ’ s economic dec@@ eler@@ ation ex@@ poses its structural vulner@@ abilities and fla@@ wed policies , the mu@@ ch-@@ hyp@@ ed notion of “ chinese excep@@ tion@@ alism ” – that china can continue to grow without the rule of law and the other essential institutions that a modern market economy pres@@ up@@ poses – is proving to be nothing but a delusion .
china is not collap@@ sing
london – one question has dominated the international mon@@ etary fund ’ s annual meeting this year in peru : will china ’ s economic down@@ turn trigger a new financial crisis just as the world is putting the last one to bed ?
but the assumption underlying that question – that china is now the global economy ’ s weak@@ est link – is highly suspect .
china certainly experienced a turbul@@ ent summer , o@@ wing to three factors : economic weakness , financial panic , and the policy response to these problems .
while none on its own would have threatened the world economy , the danger ste@@ mmed from a self-@@ rein@@ forcing interaction among them : weak economic data leads to financial tur@@ mo@@ il , which indu@@ ces policy bl@@ unders that in turn fuel more financial panic , economic weakness , and policy mistakes .
such self-@@ rein@@ forcing financial feedback is much more powerful in transmit@@ ting global economic contagi@@ on than ordinary commercial or trade expos@@ ures , as the world learned in 200@@ 8-@@ 2009 .
the question now is whether the vicious circle that began in china over the summer will continue .
a sensible answer must distinguish between financial perceptions and economic reality .
china ’ s growth slow@@ down is not in itself surprising or alarming .
as the imf not@@ ed , china ’ s growth rate has been declining ste@@ adily for five years – from 10@@ .@@ 6 % in 2010 to a projected rate of 6.@@ 8 % this year and 6.@@ 3 % in 20@@ 16 .
this dec@@ eler@@ ation was inevitable as china advanced from extreme poverty and technological back@@ war@@ dness to become a middle-@@ income economy powered by external trade and consumer spending .
it was also des@@ ir@@ able , because rapid growth was hitting environmental limits .
even as the pace of growth slo@@ ws , china is contributing more to the world economy than ever before , because its gdp today is $ 10@@ .@@ 3 trillion , up from just $ 2.@@ 3 trillion in 2005 .
simple arithmetic shows that $ 10@@ .@@ 3 trillion growing at 6 % or 7 % produces much bigger numbers than 10 % growth starting from a base that is almost five times smaller .
this base effect also means that china will continue to absorb more natural resources than ever before , despite its dimin@@ ishing growth pro@@ spe@@ cts .
yet china is causing high anxiety , especially in emerging countries , largely because financial markets have convinced themselves that its economy is not only slowing , but falling off a cliff .
many western analy@@ sts , especially in financial institutions , treat china ’ s official gdp growth of around 7 % as a political fabri@@ cation – and the imf ’ s latest confir@@ mation of its 6.@@ 8 % estimate is unlikely to convince them .
they point to steel , coal , and construction statistics , which really are collap@@ sing in several chinese regions , and to exports , which are growing much less than in the past .
but why do the skep@@ tics accept the truth of dis@@ mal government figures for construction and steel output – down 15 % and 4 % , respe@@ ctively , in the year to august – and then dis@@ miss official data showing 10@@ .@@ 8 % re@@ tail-@@ sales growth ?
one reason can be found in the finan@@ ci@@ er george sor@@ os ’ s concept of “ reflexi@@ vity . ”
sor@@ os has argued for years that financial markets can create in@@ accurate expectations and then change reality to accor@@ d with them .
this is the opposite of the process described in textbooks and built into economic models , which always assume that financial expectations adapt to reality , not the other way round .
in a classic example of reflexi@@ vity , when china ’ s stock@@ -@@ market boom turned into july ’ s bust , the government responded with a $ 200 billion attempt to support prices , closely followed by a small de@@ valu@@ ation of the previously stable ren@@ min@@ bi .
financial analy@@ sts almost univers@@ ally ridicul@@ ed these policies and ca@@ stig@@ ated chinese leaders for aband@@ oning their earlier preten@@ ses of market@@ -@@ oriented reforms .
the government ’ s apparent desperation was seen as evidence that china was in far greater trouble than previously revealed .
this belief quickly shaped reality , as market analy@@ sts blur@@ red the distinction between a growth slow@@ down and economic collapse .
in mid-@@ september , for example , when the privat@@ e-@@ sector purchasing managers ’ index ( p@@ mi ) came out at 4@@ 7.@@ 0 , the result was generally reported along these lines : “ the index has now indicated contra@@ ction in the &#91; manufacturing &#93; sector for seven con@@ secu@@ tive months . ”
in fact , chinese manufacturing was growing by 5-@@ 7 % throughout that period .
the supposed evidence was wrong because 50 is the p@@ mi ’ s dividing line not between growth and recession , but between accelerating and slowing growth .
indeed , for 19 out of the p@@ mi ’ s 36 months of existence , the value has been below 50 , while chinese manufacturing growth has aver@@ aged 7.@@ 5 % .
exagger@@ ations of this kind have under@@ min@@ ed confidence in chinese policy at a particularly dangerous time .
china is now navi@@ gating a complex economic transition that involves three some@@ times@@ -@@ confli@@ cting obje@@ ctives : creating a market@@ -based consumer economy ; re@@ forming the financial system ; and en@@ suring an or@@ derly slow@@ down that avo@@ ids the economic collapse often ac@@ compan@@ ying industrial re@@ struc@@ turing and financial liber@@ alization .
managing this tri@@ fe@@ c@@ ta successfully will require sk@@ ill@@ ful juggling of priorities – and that will become much more difficult if chinese policymakers lose international investors ’ trust or , more important , that of china ’ s own citizens and businesses .
vicious circles of economic inst@@ ability , de@@ valu@@ ation , and capital flight have brought down seemingly un@@ break@@ able regimes throughout history .
this probably explains the whi@@ ff of panic that followed china ’ s tiny , but totally unexpected , de@@ valu@@ ation of the ren@@ min@@ bi .
the ren@@ min@@ bi , however , has recently stabili@@ zed , and capital flight has d@@ wind@@ led , as eviden@@ ced by the bet@@ ter-@@ than@@ -@@ expected reserve figures released by the people ’ s bank of china on october 7 .
this suggests that the government ’ s policy of shifting gradually to a market@@ -based exchange rate may have been better executed than generally believed ; even the measures to support the stock market now look less fu@@ tile than they did in july .
in short , chinese economic management seems less in@@ competent than it did a few months ago .
indeed , china can probably avoid the financial mel@@ t@@ down widely fe@@ ared in the summer .
if so , other emerging economies tied to perceptions about china ’ s economic health should also stabilize .
the world has learned since 2008 how danger@@ ously financial expectations can interact with policy bl@@ unders , turning modest economic problems into major cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es , first in the us and then in the euro@@ zone .
it would be ironic if china ’ s communist leaders turned out to have a better understanding of capitalism ’ s reflexi@@ ve interactions among finance , the real economy , and government than western de@@ vot@@ e@@ es of free markets .
why china &apos;s fal@@ un g@@ ong movement is important
beijing : continuing supp@@ ression of members of fal@@ ong g@@ ong , a movement whose suppor@@ ters continue to “ step forward ” to respond to their leader ’ s call to “ achieve consum@@ mation by facing im@@ prison@@ ment or death , ” provides clear evidence that something new , if in@@ explic@@ able , is happening in china .
but there is a paradox here , for this “ something new ” is also something very old .
it is precisely because this mass cul@@ t-@@ tur@@ ne@@ d-@@ prote@@ st-@@ movement has a traditional resonance that it poses such a threat to the party establishment .
when , in april 1999 , ten thousand members of the fal@@ un g@@ ong sect appeared mysteri@@ ously in front of z@@ hon@@ g@@ nan@@ hai , the compound of the chinese communist party ’ s leadership , to be arrested en masse , obser@@ vers found it hard to explain what was going on .
the overseas press corps in beijing was used to explaining political dissi@@ dents , student prote@@ sters , dis@@ grun@@ tled workers and dis@@ en@@ franch@@ ised members of the “ floating population . ”
this my@@ stical , cryp@@ to buddhist / ta@@ o@@ ist sect of middle class medi@@ tators , however , seemed to arise out of nowhere so that its origins and seriousness as a threat to china ’ s party establishment were difficult to ass@@ ess .
the group , it turned out , was led by an ex@@ iled patri@@ arch , li hon@@ g@@ z@@ hi , who had con@@ ju@@ red his cult out of traditional chinese breathing exercis@@ es ( q@@ ig@@ ong ) , a belief in miracle cur@@ es , no@@ stru@@ ms about clean living , and a mis@@ h-@@ mash of buddhist and ta@@ o@@ ist my@@ stic@@ ism .
as wave after wave of fal@@ un g@@ ong suppor@@ ters arrived in ti@@ an@@ an@@ men square to be arrested , however , what began as an aber@@ rant event became the most widespread movement of organized protest in china since 1989 .
what makes fal@@ un g@@ ong so threatening is that not only is it led by a very tradition@@ alistic leader , but that its my@@ stical doctrine and charis@@ matic rebel@@ li@@ ousness evo@@ ke for chinese an ing@@ ra@@ ined sense of historical memory of past rul@@ ing dy@@ na@@ sti@@ es that fell after being challenged by a similar internal millen@@ arian movement .
for chinese , such cul@@ tic movements have deep symbolic significance because of their association with the idea of dy@@ na@@ stic deca@@ y and collapse .
few chinese do not know legen@@ ds and stories from history , which are passed down through the generations in novels , oper@@ as , plays and now films , comic books and even tv series .
these stories tell of how the han dy@@ nasty ’ s ( 20@@ 6 b.@@ c-@@ 4@@ 22 a.@@ d ) end was pres@@ aged by the my@@ stical yellow tur@@ ban rebellion or of how the q@@ ing dy@@ nasty ( 16@@ 4@@ 4-@@ 19@@ 11 ) , china ’ s last , ran af@@ oul of the equally my@@ stical white lot@@ us and then the box@@ er rebel@@ lions .
cul@@ t-@@ animated u@@ pris@@ ings against un@@ just authority , with which fal@@ un g@@ ong is now identified , have always been viewed by chinese as port@@ ents that political legiti@@ macy -- sanc@@ tioned by the so-called “ mandate of heaven ” ( ti@@ an@@ ming ) that is said to exist when “ heaven ” conf@@ ers its favor on a rul@@ ing dy@@ nasty -- has been with@@ drawn .
for a government such as that now rul@@ ing china , one which does not deri@@ ve legiti@@ macy from the will of the people , the deeply rooted cultural presum@@ ption of ordinary people that the cosmic forces of heaven no longer shine on it , could deal a devastating psychological blow .
so , fal@@ ung g@@ ong is viewed as an omin@@ ous threat to party he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y , perhaps even more omin@@ ous than any previous protest movement .
there are four reasons for this :
 because it has deep traditional and na@@ tiv@@ ist chinese roots , fal@@ ung g@@ ong ’ s message cannot be branded as an impor@@ ted and in@@ appropriate foreign ideology in the way that notions of democracy and christi@@ an@@ ity are dis@@ missed by chinese nation@@ alists and xen@@ opho@@ bes ;
 because the destruction of traditional con@@ fu@@ cian values during mao ’ s revolution and then the im@@ plo@@ sion of mar@@ x@@ ist ideology during deng xia@@ oping ’ s economic reform era left china bere@@ ft of a coherent belief system , many chinese are susceptible to any group that offers basic answers to questions about the meaning of life ;
 unlike student prote@@ sters who were basically ration@@ alists and usually had clear demands to which the party could respond ( if it wished ) , li hon@@ g@@ z@@ hi ’ s cri@@ ti@@ que that contemporary chinese life has fallen into a mor@@ ass of im@@ morality and ven@@ ality broo@@ ks no easy response ;
 because this diffuse but mass-@@ based sect communic@@ ates with its members by word of mouth and over the internet rather than by conventional means , it is difficult for the party to dis@@ rupt its nerve centers .
in this sense fal@@ un g@@ ong is a double paradox : a tradition@@ alistic movement frei@@ ghted with deep historical symboli@@ sm , it is also a cyber-@@ sav@@ vy , modern chinese protest movement .
nothing in china ever seems to happen quite in the way china experts predict .
virtually no expert fores@@ a@@ w the events of 1989 ; no expert whom i know imagined that china ’ s next wave of dest@@ abili@@ zing protest might come from a mass movement of super@@ sti@@ tious middle-aged , middle-class citizens dedicated to recycled notions of buddhist and ta@@ o@@ ist clean living , health through meditation , breathing exercis@@ es and my@@ stic@@ ism spread via the internet .
by deta@@ ining thousands of sect followers the party may un@@ wi@@ tt@@ ingly transform an er@@ rant spiritual movement into a dangerous political force .
is state capitalism winning ?
cambridge – in the age-@@ old contest of econom@@ ic@@ -@@ growth models , state capitalism has seemed to be gaining the upper hand in recent years .
avat@@ ars of liberal capitalism like the united states and the united kingdom continued to perform an@@ emi@@ cally in 2012 , while many asian countries , rel@@ ying on various versions of diri@@ g@@ is@@ me , have not only grown rapidly and ste@@ adily over the last several decades , but have also wea@@ thered recent economic storms with surprising grace .
so , is it time to update the economics textbooks ?
in fact , economics does not say that un@@ fe@@ ttered markets are better than state intervention or even state capitalism .
the problems with state capitalism are primarily political , not economic . any real-world economy is ri@@ ddled with market failures , so a ben@@ evol@@ ent and om@@ ni@@ potent government could sensi@@ bly intervene quite often .
but who has ever met a ben@@ evol@@ ent or om@@ ni@@ potent government ?
to understand the logic of state capitalism , it is useful to recall some early examples – not the soci@@ alist command economies or modern societies seeking to combat market failures , but ancient civilizations .
indeed , it seems that , like farming or democracy , state capitalism has been independently invented many times in world history .
consider the greek bronze age , during which many powerful states , organized around a city housing the political elite , formed throughout the mediterranean basin .
these states had no money and essentially no markets .
the state tax@@ ed agricultural output and controlled nearly all goods production .
it mono@@ poli@@ zed trade , and , in the absence of money , moved all of the goods around by fi@@ at .
it supp@@ lied food and inputs to wea@@ vers and then took their output . in essence , the greek bronze age societies had something that looked remarkably like state capitalism .
so did the in@@ cas as they built their huge an@@ dean empire in the century before the spanish arrived .
how is it that societies as disparate as the greek bronze age cities of kno@@ s@@ sos , my@@ cen@@ a@@ e , or py@@ los , the in@@ ca empire , soviet russia , south korea , and now china all ended up with state capitalism ?
the answer lies in recognizing that state capitalism is not about efficient allo@@ cation of economic resources , but about maxi@@ mi@@ zing political control over society and the economy .
if state managers can grab all productive resources and control access to them , this maxi@@ mi@@ zes control – even if it sacrifi@@ ces economic efficiency .
to be sure , in many parts of the world , state capitalism has helped to con@@ soli@@ date states and centr@@ alize authority – pre@@ conditions for the development of modern societies and economies .
but political control of the economy generally becomes problematic , because those running the state do not have social welfare or optimal resource allo@@ cation in mind .
the state capitalism of the greek bronze age or the in@@ ca empire was not motivated by economic in@@ efficiency ; nor did it necessarily create a more efficient economy .
what it did was help to con@@ soli@@ date political power .
at a deeper level , the real dich@@ ot@@ omy is not between state capitalism and un@@ fe@@ ttered markets ; it is between extra@@ ctive and inclusive economic institutions . extra@@ ctive institutions create a non-@@ level playing field , r@@ ents , and nar@@ row@@ ly concentrated benefits for those with political power and connections .
inclusive institutions create a level playing field and give incentives and opportunities to the great mass of people .
but herein lies the problem for state capitalism : inclusive institutions require a private sector powerful enough to counter@@ balance and check the state .
thus , state ownership tends naturally to remove one of the key pillars of an inclusive society .
it should be no surprise that state capitalism is almost always associated with authoritarian regimes and extra@@ ctive political institutions .
this is not an end@@ or@@ se@@ ment of un@@ fe@@ ttered markets .
the state plays a central role in modern society , and rightly so .
modern economic growth , even under inclusive institutions , often creates deep ine@@ qualities and til@@ ted playing fields , endanger@@ ing those institutions ’ very survival .
the modern regul@@ atory and re@@ distribu@@ tive state can , within certain bo@@ unds , help to red@@ ress these problems . but the success of such a project cru@@ cially depends on society having control over the state – not the other way around .
to argue that state capitalism ’ s success proves its super@@ i@@ ority is to put the cart before the horse .
yes , south korea grew rapidly under state capitalism , and china is doing likewise today .
but state capitalism emerged not because there was no other way to ensure economic growth in these countries , but because it enabled growth without dest@@ abili@@ zing the existing power structure .
the genius of china ’ s state capitalism is that it en@@ su@@ red the continued dominance of communist party elites while improving the allo@@ cation of resources , not that it alone could have provided price incentives to farmers and then managed liber@@ alization of urban markets .
state capitalism will persist so long as existing elites are able to maintain it and benefit from it – even if economic growth ultimately st@@ alls .
and there is a good reason why it eventually will .
sustained economic growth pres@@ up@@ poses inclusive institutions , because innovation – and the creative destruction and inst@@ ability that it w@@ rea@@ ks – depends on them . extra@@ ctive institutions in general , and state capitalism in particular , can support economic growth for a while , but only the sort of cat@@ ch@@ -up growth that south korea experienced from the 1960 ’ s to the 1980 ’ s , before starting to transform its society and economy more radically .
as the low hanging fruit from cat@@ ch@@ -up growth is consumed , china , too , will be forced to choose between the economic and social freedom , innovation , and inst@@ ability that only inclusive institutions can under@@ pin and continued economic , political , and social control in the service of the elites who control the state .
quit@@ ting the quot@@ a
hong kong – on march 1 , china ’ s state council announced a new bat@@ ch of restri@@ ctions aimed at rein@@ ing in property prices by cur@@ bing specu@@ lative demand .
the measures include ti@@ ghter limits on home purch@@ ases by non-@@ loc@@ als in cities with exc@@ essive price gains , a rein@@ forced 20 % capit@@ al-@@ gains tax , mand@@ atory 70 % down payments , and a 30 % bench@@ mark interest@@ -@@ rate premi@@ um for second mort@@ g@@ ages .
while the previous round of hous@@ ing-@@ sector restri@@ ctions , implemented less than two years ago , dam@@ pen@@ ed market senti@@ ment tempor@@ arily , it failed to cur@@ b rising property prices .
likewise , although the latest measures might have some impact , cooling china ’ s turbul@@ ent property market – which reli@@ es on cheap credit – in the long term will require addressing underlying mon@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ policy weak@@ nesses .
the policy is rooted in central planning , which , three decades ago , led to artifi@@ cially low prices and , in turn , to shor@@ tages of basic necessi@@ ties and key production inputs , such as grain and steel .
as the free market developed , a du@@ al-@@ price system emerged , in which those with access to quot@@ a-@@ allo@@ cated goods paid less .
as a result , the government was comp@@ elled to grant subsidies to the system ’ s “ los@@ ers ” – such as urban residents and state-@@ owned enter@@ pris@@ es ( so@@ es ) – until strong supply responses to rising market prices eliminated the need for quot@@ as on manufactured products .
a decade later , in response to the global financial crisis , china loo@@ sen@@ ed credit quot@@ as and planning controls on so@@ e-@@ run lo@@ cal@@ -@@ government infrastructure projects .
between november 2008 and june 2009 , china ’ s banks issued more than ¥ 8.@@ 6 trillion ( $ 1.3 trillion ) in new loans . as a result , the rate of credit growth increased from 14 % in september 2008 to 35 % a year later , and property prices more than doubled in many cities .
exc@@ essi@@ vely low interest rates have generated a mis@@ match between housing prices and the available supply , because they serve as hidden subsidies for those who can borrow – for example , the rich and so@@ es – and thus stimulate demand for luxury property .
in order to cur@@ b this trend , policymakers have rever@@ ted to the quot@@ a as a macro@@ economic tool , but this time for housing credit .
like quot@@ as on manufactured products , these new quot@@ as are generating a du@@ al-@@ price allo@@ cation system , in which so@@ es can borrow at significantly lower interest rates than small and medi@@ um-@@ size enter@@ pris@@ es ( s@@ mes ) , which must rely on the informal market at interest rates as high as 2 % monthly .
but eliminating quot@@ as in order to allow prices to reach market@@ -@@ clear@@ ing levels is not an option this time , o@@ wing to the complexity and competi@@ tiveness of the real-@@ estate and bank@@ -@@ credit markets .
first , the domestic interest groups that benefit from low borrowing costs have become a barrier to their liber@@ alization .
there is a “ common@@ -@@ sense consensus ” among bor@@ ro@@ wers – in china , as well as in highly inde@@ b@@ ted advanced economies – that raising interest rates would under@@ mine gdp growth , employment , and asset prices .
second , many argue that raising interest rates would trigger a flood of specu@@ lative capital from low-@@ yiel@@ ding advanced economies .
with the p@@ bo@@ c unable to sterili@@ ze the in@@ flows , upward pressure on the ren@@ min@@ bi ’ s exchange rate would threaten competi@@ tiveness .
finally , an inadequate understanding of structural inflation ( the growth in prices for non-@@ tra@@ dable assets ) has generated the false belief that china can maintain similar levels of inflation and ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate stability as the oecd economies .
as a result , over the last decade , the chinese authorities ’ implic@@ it target for annual inflation and currency appreciation has been only about 3 % .
but china has atta@@ ined much higher gdp growth than the oecd economies , driven largely by the rapid productivity gains that characteri@@ ze the initial “ catch up ” phase of emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market development .
as china continues to implement market@@ -@@ oriented reforms , the prices of non-@@ tra@@ dable assets – such as property , natural resources , utili@@ ties , services , and wages – will continue to rise much faster than in the oecd countries , until they eventually conver@@ ge .
this process will inevitably lead to higher structural inflation and currency appreciation in china .
if nomin@@ al interest rates are lower than the real return on investment – associated with gdp growth – the result is financial repres@@ sion and increased income and wealth inequality .
to avoid this outcome , as long as china ’ s gdp growth exce@@ eds that of oecd economies , its nomin@@ al interest rates must also be higher , its exchange rate must be more flexible , and it must tolerate higher structural inflation .
indeed , despite domestic resistance , the p@@ bo@@ c must raise nomin@@ al interest rates so that they are in line with structural inflation .
such a move would deter exc@@ essive investment in productive capacity , and ease the imple@@ mentation of a more flexible ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate regime .
at the same time , one need only recall the damage that un@@ regulated carry tra@@ des wr@@ ought on asian economies in the 1990 ’ s to understand why china must ere@@ ct barriers to protect its domestic markets from in@@ flows of hot money .
the alternative to this pri@@ ce-@@ oriented approach – continued dependence on the quot@@ a system – would incu@@ r consider@@ able administra@@ tive expen@@ ses , efficiency losses , and social costs ste@@ mming from r@@ ent-@@ seeking and corruption .
much like the quot@@ a system of 30 years ago , the current reli@@ ance on quot@@ as is unsustainable in the long term .
to manage ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ant demand for financial and physical assets , china ’ s leaders must address its root cause : the low cost of capital .
doing so will require maintaining some capit@@ al-@@ account control , while raising interest rates to market@@ -@@ clear@@ ing levels .
this , not the unsustainable im@@ position of quot@@ as , is the real mon@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ policy challenge facing china today .
controlling china ’ s currency
beijing – it is in@@ dispu@@ table that china is over-@@ issu@@ ing currency .
but the reasons behind china ’ s massive liqui@@ dity growth – and the most effective strategy for controlling it – are less obvious .
the last decade has been a “ golden age ” of high growth and low inflation in china .
from 2003 to 2012 , china ’ s annual gdp growth aver@@ aged 10@@ .@@ 5 % , while prices rose by only 3 % annu@@ ally .
but the unprecedented speed and scale of china ’ s mon@@ etary expansion remain a concern , given that it could still trigger high inflation and lead to asse@@ t-@@ price bubbles , debt growth , and capital out@@ flows .
data from the people ’ s bank of china ( p@@ bo@@ c ) show that , as of the end of last year , china ’ s m@@ 2 ( broad money supply ) stood at ¥ 9@@ 7.@@ 4 trillion ( $ 15@@ .@@ 6 trillion ) , or 18@@ 8 % of gdp .
to compare , m@@ 2 in the united states amounts to only roughly 63 % of gdp .
in fact , according to standard char@@ tered bank , china ran@@ ks first worldwide in terms of both overall m@@ 2 and newly issued currency .
in 2011 , china accoun@@ ted for an estimated 52 % of the world ’ s added liqui@@ dity .
but a horizontal comparison of absolute values is inadequate to ass@@ ess the true scale of china ’ s mon@@ etary emissions .
several other factors must be considered , including china ’ s financial structure , finan@@ cing model , savings rate , and stage of economic development , as well as the relationship between currency and finance in china .
china ’ s intensive economic mon@@ eti@@ zation is a key factor driving its mon@@ e@@ y-@@ supply growth .
but china ’ s shar@@ ply rising mon@@ eti@@ zation rate cannot be jud@@ ged against the high , steady rates of developed countries without bearing in mind that china ’ s mon@@ eti@@ zation process began much later , and has distinct structural and institutional foundations .
as china has opened up its economy , dee@@ pen@@ ed reforms , and become increasingly market@@ -@@ oriented , the government has facili@@ tated the continuous mon@@ eti@@ zation of resources – including natural resources , labor , capital , and technology – by en@@ suring their constant delivery to the market .
this has fu@@ eled rising demand for currency , leading to the expansion of the mon@@ etary base , with the money multipli@@ er – that is , the effect on len@@ ding by commercial banks – boo@@ sting the money supply further .
and , as gdp growth has become increasingly dependent on govern@@ ment-@@ led investment , currency demand has continued to rise .
indeed , the rapid expansion of bank credit needed to finance sky@@ rock@@ eting govern@@ ment-@@ led investment is increasing the amount of liqui@@ dity in china ’ s financial system .
as a result , in the last four years , china ’ s m@@ 2 , spur@@ red by a stimulus package tot@@ aling ¥ 4 trillion in 2008 and 2009 , has more than doubled .
this trend is exac@@ erb@@ ated by the declining efficiency of financial resources in the state sector , a product of the soft budget constra@@ int impli@@ ed by easily accessible , cheap capital .
con@@ sequ@@ ently , maintaining high gdp growth rates requires an ever-@@ increasing volume of credit and a continuously growing money supply .
so china is stuck in a curren@@ cy@@ -@@ creating cycle : gdp growth encoura@@ ges investment , which boo@@ sts demand for capital .
this generates liqui@@ dity , which then stimul@@ ates gdp growth .
the key to controlling china ’ s mon@@ etary expansion is to clari@@ fy the relationship between currency ( the central bank ) and finance ( the financial sector ) , thereby preventing the government from assuming the role of a second curren@@ cy@@ -@@ creating body .
according to pan gon@@ g@@ sh@@ eng , a de@@ pu@@ ty governor of the p@@ bo@@ c , the relationship between the central bank and the financial sector ent@@ a@@ ils both a division of labor and a system of checks and balances .
in theory , the financial sector serves as a kind of accoun@@ tant for the treas@@ ury and the government , while the p@@ bo@@ c acts as the government ’ s cas@@ hier .
in practice , however , the relationship between currency and finance is vague , with both assuming qu@@ asi@@ -@@ fiscal functions .
china ’ s low official government debt largely reflects the role of currency in assuming qu@@ asi@@ -@@ fiscal li@@ abilities – not only the wri@@ te-@@ off costs in@@ cur@@ red from re@@ forming state-@@ owned banks , but also the take@@ over of banks ’ bad deb@@ ts via note finan@@ cing and the purchase of asse@@ t-@@ management companies ’ bonds .
these activities both damage the p@@ bo@@ c ’ s balance sheet and constra@@ in mon@@ etary policy .
at the same time , finance takes on qu@@ asi@@ -@@ fiscal functions by exclu@@ ding government fiscal depos@@ its – government depos@@ its in the national treas@@ ury , commercial banks ’ fiscal savings , and central treas@@ ury cash managed through commerci@@ al-@@ bank depos@@ its – from the money supply .
given the large volume of fiscal depos@@ its – which tot@@ aled ¥ 2.@@ 4 trillion ( 3.@@ 3 % of m@@ 2 ) at the end of 2010 – their impact on the money supply cannot be ignored .
clari@@ fying the relationship between currency and finance is essential to en@@ suring that all newly issued currency is backed by assets .
only by exer@@ ting a harder budget constra@@ int on the state sector , limit@@ ing fiscal expansion , and reducing dependence on govern@@ ment-@@ led investment can china ’ s exc@@ essive currency issu@@ ance be addressed in the long term .
why china won ’ t rule
this question is increasingly asked as china ’ s economic growth sur@@ ges ahead at more than 8 % a year , while the developed world remains mi@@ red in recession or near-@@ recession .
china is already the world ’ s second largest economy , and will be the largest in 20@@ 17 .
and its military spending is racing ahead of its gdp growth .
the question is reasonable enough if we don ’ t give it an american twist .
to the american mind , there can be only one superpower , so china ’ s rise will automatically be at the expense of the united states .
indeed , for many in the us , china represents an existential challenge .
this is way over the top .
in fact , the existence of a single superpower is highly abnormal , and was brought about only by the unexpected collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the normal situation is one of co@@ existence , sometimes peaceful sometimes war@@ like , between several great powers .
for example , great britain , whose place the us is often said to have taken , was never a “ superpower ” in the american sense .
despite its far-@@ flung empire and na@@ val supre@@ macy , n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ century britain could never have won a war against france , germany , or russia without allies .
britain was , rather , a world power – one of many historical empires distingu@@ ished from lesser powers by the geographic scope of their influence and interests .
the sensible question , then , is not whether china will replace the us , but whether it will start to acquire some of the attributes of a world power , particularly a sense of responsibility for global order .
even posed in this more modest way , the question does not admit of a clear answer .
the first problem is china ’ s economy , so dynamic on the surface , but so rick@@ et@@ y underneath .
the analyst chi lo luci@@ dly presents a picture of ma@@ cro success alongside mi@@ cro failure .
the huge stimulus of r@@ m@@ b@@ 4 trillion ( $ 5@@ 86 billion ) in november 2008 , mostly poured into los@@ s-@@ making state-@@ owned enter@@ pris@@ es via directed bank len@@ ding , sustained china ’ s growth in the face of global recession .
but the price was an increasingly serious mis@@ allo@@ cation of capital , resul@@ ting in growing portfoli@@ os of bad loans , while exc@@ essive chinese household savings have in@@ fl@@ ated real-@@ estate bubbles .
moreover , chi argues that the crisis of 2008 shat@@ tered china ’ s ex@@ port-@@ led growth model , o@@ wing to pro@@ lon@@ ged im@@ pair@@ ment of demand in the advanced countries .
china now ur@@ gently needs to re@@ balance its economy by shifting from public investment and exports towards public and private consumption .
in the short run , some of its savings need to be invested in real assets abroad , and not just parked in us treas@@ u@@ ries .
but , in the longer term , chinese households ’ exc@@ essive pro@@ pen@@ sity to save must be reduced by developing a social safety net and consumer credit instruments .
moreover , to be a world economic power , china requires a currency in which foreig@@ ners want to invest .
that means introducing full conver@@ ti@@ bility and creating a deep and liquid financial system , a stock market for raising capital , and a market rate of interest for loans .
and , while china has talked of “ internation@@ alizing ” the ren@@ min@@ bi , it has done little so far .
“ meanwhile , ” writes chi , “ the dollar is still supported by the strong us political relations with most of the world ’ s largest foreig@@ n-@@ reser@@ ve-@@ holding countries . ”
japan , south korea , saudi arabia , kuwait , qatar , and the united arab e@@ mir@@ ates all shelter under the us military umbr@@ ella .
the second problem is one of political values .
china ’ s further “ as@@ cent ” will depend on dis@@ man@@ tling such classic communist policy icons as publi@@ c-@@ asset ownership , population control , and financial repres@@ sion .
the question remains how far these reforms will be allowed to go before they challenge the communist party ’ s political monopoly , guaranteed by the 1978 constitution .
two important cultural values under@@ pin china ’ s political system .
the first is the hierarch@@ ical and famili@@ al character of chinese political thought .
chinese philosophers acknowledge the value of spontan@@ ei@@ ty , but within a strictly ordered world in which people know their place .
as the anal@@ ec@@ ts of con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us puts it : “ let the rul@@ er be a rul@@ er , the subject a subject , a father a father , and a son a son . ”
there is also very little belief in the sanc@@ ti@@ ty of human life : buddh@@ ism holds that there is no difference between humans and animals and plants .
a ple@@ dge to protect human rights was written into the chinese constitution in 2004 ; but , as the recent case of the blind dissi@@ dent chen gu@@ ang@@ chen@@ g illustrates , this is mostly a dead letter .
similarly , private property ran@@ ks below collective property .
then there is the con@@ fu@@ cian doctrine of the “ mandate of heaven , ” by which political rule is legiti@@ mi@@ zed .
today , the mandate of mar@@ x@@ ism has taken its place , but neither has any room for a mandate of the people .
ambi@@ valence about the source of legitimate government is not only a major obstacle to democra@@ tization , but is also a potential source of political inst@@ ability .
these historical leg@@ ac@@ ies limit the extent to which china will be able to share in global leadership , which requires some degree of compati@@ bility between chinese and western values .
the west claims that its values are universal , and the us and europe will not ce@@ ase pressing those values on china .
it is hard to see this process going into reverse , with china starting to export its own values .
china has a choice : it can either accept western values , or it can try to car@@ ve out an east asian sphere to insu@@ late itself from them .
the lat@@ ter course would provo@@ ke conflict not only with the us , but also with other asian powers , particularly japan and india .
china ’ s best possible future thus probably lies in accepting western norms while trying to flavor them with “ chinese characteristics . ”
but neither choice is a scenario for china “ replacing ” the us .
nor , i think , is this what china wants .
its goal is respect , not dominance .
why chinese companies stay at home
why cutting carbon emissions is not enough
twenty years ago , governments adopted the mon@@ tre@@ al protocol , a treaty to protect the earth ’ s ozone layer from emissions of destructive chemicals .
few could have fores@@ een how far-@@ reaching that decision would prove to be .
the protocol explicitly aimed at phas@@ ing-@@ out sub@@ stances such as chlor@@ o@@ flu@@ or@@ o@@ carbons ( c@@ f@@ cs ) – found in products such as refriger@@ ators , fo@@ ams , and hair@@ spra@@ ys – in order to repair the thin gas@@ sy@@ -@@ shield that filters out the sun ’ s harmful , ultra-@@ vio@@ let rays .
by 2010 , close to 100 o@@ z@@ one-@@ deple@@ ting sub@@ stances , including c@@ f@@ cs , will have been phas@@ ed-@@ out globally .
without the decisions taken 20 years ago , atmospheric levels of o@@ z@@ one-@@ deple@@ ting sub@@ stances would have increased ten-@@ fold by 2050 .
this could have led to up to 20 million additional cases of skin cancer and 130 million more cases of eye cat@@ ar@@ acts , not to speak of damage to human immune systems , wildlife , and agriculture .
but this is only part of the story that we celebrate on the international day for the preservation of the ozone layer ( september 16 ) .
over the past two years , it has been established that the mon@@ tre@@ al protocol has also spar@@ ed humanity a significant level of climate change , because the gases that it prohi@@ bits also contribute to global warming .
indeed , a study in 2007 calculated the climate mi@@ ti@@ gation benefits of the ozone treaty as tot@@ alling the equivalent of 1@@ 35 billion tons of co2 since 1990 , or a delay in global warming of 7-@@ 12 years .
so the lessons learned from the mon@@ tre@@ al protocol may have wider significance .
scientists now estimate that somewhere close to 50 % of climate change is being caused by gases and pollutants other than co2 , including nitrogen compounds , low-@@ level ozone formed by pollution , and black carbon .
of course , a degree of scientific uncertainty about some of these pollutants ’ precise contribution to warming remains .
but they certainly play a significant role .
meanwhile , many of these gases need to be cur@@ bed because of their wider environmental impact on public health , agriculture , and the planet ’ s multi-@@ trillion dollar ecosystems , including forests .
consider black carbon , a component of the so@@ ot emissions from dies@@ el engines and the inefficient burning of biomass cooking sto@@ ves that is linked to 1.@@ 6 million to 1.@@ 8 million premature deaths annu@@ ally as a result of indoor exposure and 80@@ 0,000 as a result of outdoor exposure .
black carbon , which absor@@ bs heat from the sun , also accounts for anywhere from 10 % to more than 45 % of the contribution to global warming , and is also linked to accelerated losses of glaciers in asia , because the so@@ ot depos@@ its dar@@ ken , ice making it more vulnerable to melting .
one study estimates that 26 % of black carbon emissions are from sto@@ ves for heating and cooking , with more than 40 % of this amount from wood burning , roughly 20 % from coal , 19 % from crop resi@@ du@@ es , and 10 % from dung .
some companies have developed sto@@ ves that use passive air flows , better insu@@ lation , and 60 % less wood to reduce black carbon emissions by around 70 % .
mass introduction of such sto@@ ves could deliver multiple gre@@ en-@@ economy benefits .
while co2 can remain in the atmosphere for centuries , other pollutants , including black carbon and ozone , remain for relatively periods – days , weeks , months , or years – so that reducing or ending emissions promises almost immediate climate benefits .
the international community ’ s over-@@ arch@@ ing concern must be to seal a serious and significant deal at the united nations climate summit in copenhagen in december to cur@@ tail c@@ 0@@ 2 emissions and ass@@ ist vulnerable countries to adapt .
if the world also is to deploy all available means to combat climate change , emissions of all sub@@ stances that contribute to it must be scientifically evalu@@ ated and ur@@ gently addressed .
the centri@@ sts cannot hold
washington – in most advanced democracies , a large cen@@ ter-@@ right party compe@@ tes with a large cen@@ ter-@@ left party .
of course , the extent to which an elec@@ toral system favor@@ s large parties – by having high popul@@ ar-@@ vote thres@@ holds to enter parliament , or through w@@ inner@@ -@@ take-@@ all constitu@@ encies – affects the degree of political frag@@ mentation .
but , by and large , the developed democracies are characterized by competition between large parties on the center left and center right .
what , then , are true centri@@ sts like mari@@ o mon@@ ti , italy ’ s respected techno@@ cratic prime minister , to do ?
to be sure , regional and ethnic alle@@ gi@@ ances play a greater role in some places in europe – for example , scotland , bel@@ gi@@ um , and cat@@ al@@ onia – but far more so in emerging countries , where political c@@ lea@@ v@@ ages also reflect specific post-@@ coloni@@ al circumstances and often the legacy of single-@@ party rule .
nonetheless , even in “ emerging market ” democracies , such as chile , mexico , south korea , and india , a left-@@ right c@@ lea@@ vage plays an important role – while those who claim the political center generally remain weak .
the british liberal democrats , for example , have tried for decades to become a strong centr@@ ist third party , without success .
while the political vocabulary in the united states is different , the democratic party , since franklin roosevelt ’ s pres@@ iden@@ cy , is indeed a cen@@ ter-@@ left force , the republican party occupi@@ es the right , and no other significant party exists .
in france and germany , there is more frag@@ mentation .
politics is still dominated by a large cen@@ ter-@@ left party and a large cen@@ ter-@@ right party , but smaller groups – some cla@@ iming the center and others the right and left extremes – challenge them to various degrees .
in some countries , the “ gre@@ ens ” have their own identity , close to the left ; but , despite remarkable progress in germany , they remain unable to reach the elec@@ toral size of the large cen@@ ter-@@ right and cen@@ ter-@@ left parties .
variations of this basic structure exist in spain , portugal , greece , turkey , and the nor@@ dic countries .
the situation is particularly interesting in italy , where mon@@ ti , having decided to contest the up@@ coming general election , has had to position himself on the right ( which he sign@@ aled by atten@@ ding a gathering of the leaders of europe ’ s cen@@ ter-@@ right parties ) .
he and former prime minister sil@@ vi@@ o ber@@ lus@@ con@@ i are now fighting for space on the right , with the cen@@ ter-@@ left democrats leading in the polls .
there are at least four differences between cen@@ ter-@@ right and cen@@ ter-@@ left approaches to social and economic challenges .
the right has greater confidence in markets to allo@@ cate resources and provide appropriate incentives ; favor@@ s private consumption over public goods ; is minim@@ ally concerned with economic inequality ; and tends to be more nation@@ alistic and less optimistic about international cooperation .
when looking at actual economic policies as they have evolved over decades , we see that they always combine cen@@ ter-@@ right and cen@@ ter-@@ left elements .
repeated financial crises have temper@@ ed even the right ’ s faith in un@@ regulated markets , while the left has become more realistic and cau@@ tious about state planning and bureau@@ cratic processes .
likewise , the choice between priv@@ ately consumed and publicly consumed “ goods ” is often blur@@ red , as politicians tend to rein@@ force citizens ’ understandable tendency to demand public goods while reje@@ cting the taxes needed to pay for them .
as income inequality has increased – dramatically in some countries , such as the us – it is moving to the fore@@ front of the debate , rein@@ forcing the traditional political divide .
nonetheless , the center right and the center left are arguing about the degree of re@@ distribution , not about the need for some progressi@@ vity in taxes and transfers .
both also agree on the need for international cooperation in an increasingly inter@@ dependent world , with differences mainly concern@@ ing how much effort to spend on it .
so , given that differences in policies as they are implemented have become largely a matter of degree , why do centr@@ ist parties remain weak ?
why have they failed to unite moder@@ ates on both sides of the ideological divide ?
one reason is that only a minority of any population is active politically .
active party members hold more ide@@ ologically consistent views – and hold them more strongly – than most of those who are politically less engaged , giving activists dis@@ proportion@@ ate influence in the political process .
after all , more nuan@@ ced ideas and policy pro@@ pos@@ als are relatively difficult to propag@@ ate effectively enough to generate broad and enthusiastic popular support .
but there also really are fundamental differences in values and economic philosophi@@ es , as well as in economic interests , leading to a fairly consistent posi@@ tioning of voters on the right or left .
disagreement may lead to com@@ promises , but that does not change the underlying differences in starting positions .
it is probably a good thing that structured competition between large cen@@ ter-@@ right and cen@@ ter-@@ left parties persi@@ sts .
such parties can help to integrate the extremes into the political mainstream , while facili@@ tating alter@@ nation in power , which is essential to any democracy ’ s dynam@@ ism ; a system in which a large centr@@ ist party remained permanently in power would be far less des@@ ir@@ able .
those , like mon@@ ti , who want to mount a challenge from the center , however personally impressive they may be , have ste@@ ep obstacles to overcome , and for good reasons .
why democracy requires trusted experts
paris – last month , i wrote a commentary asking why voters in the united kingdom supported leaving the european union , de@@ fying the overwhelming weight of expert opinion warning of the major economic costs of bre@@ x@@ it .
i observed that many voters in the uk and elsewhere are angry at economic experts .
they say that the experts failed to fores@@ ee the financial crisis of 2008 , put efficiency first in their policy advice , and blin@@ dly assumed that the los@@ ers from their policy prescri@@ ptions could be comp@@ ens@@ ated in some un@@ speci@@ fied way .
i argued that experts should be hum@@ bler and more atten@@ tive to distribu@@ tional issues .
the piece e@@ lic@@ ited far more comments from readers than any of my others .
their reactions mostly confirm the anger i had not@@ ed .
remarkably , i also received comments from professionals in the natural sciences who said that citizens ’ growing di@@ str@@ ust of experts was pervasive in their disciplines , too .
scientific views in fields like energy , climate , genetics , and medicine face widespread popular reje@@ ction .
in the united states , for example , a pe@@ w research survey found that 67 % of adults think that scientists lack a clear understanding about the health effects of genetically modified organisms .
mi@@ str@@ ust of g@@ mos is even higher in europe .
whereas overall support for science remains strong , many citizens believe that it is manipulated by special interests , and on some issues , the common view de@@ parts from the established evidence .
this divide between experts and citizens is a cause for deep concern .
representative democracy is based not only on universal suff@@ rage , but also on reason .
ide@@ ally , deliber@@ ations and votes result in rational decisions that use the current state of knowledge to deliver policies that advance citizens ’ well@@ being .
this requires a process in which experts – whose compe@@ tence and honesty are trusted – inform decision-@@ makers of the available options for meeting voters ’ stated preferences .
citizens are unlikely to be satisfied if they believe that experts are im@@ posing their own agenda , or are captured by special interests .
di@@ str@@ ust of experts fuels di@@ str@@ ust of democra@@ tically elected governments , if not of democracy itself .
why is there such a divide between experts and society ?
every country has had its own series of high-@@ profile public health or safety sc@@ and@@ als .
experts have been guilty of slo@@ pp@@ iness and conflicts of interest .
hard-@@ won repu@@ tations have been quickly lost .
but cri@@ tics often fail to recognize that science involves more – and more string@@ ent – scru@@ tiny than , say , business or government .
it is actually the standard-@@ be@@ ar@@ er of good practices concern@@ ing the vali@@ dation of analy@@ ses and the discussion of policy pro@@ pos@@ als .
errors regularly occur in academia , but they are more swi@@ f@@ tly and systematically correc@@ ted than in other fields .
the collective nature of scientific vali@@ dation also provides guarante@@ es against capture by special interests .
the problem may , in fact , be deeper than the common gri@@ ev@@ ances against experts suggest .
a few decades ago , it was widely assumed that progress in mass education would gradually bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and popular belief , thereby contributing to a more ser@@ ene and more rational democracy .
the evidence is that it has not .
as ger@@ ald bron@@ ner , a french soci@@ ologist , has convin@@ c@@ ingly shown , education neither increases trust in science nor dimin@@ ishes the attraction of beliefs or theories that scientists regard as utter nonsense .
on the contrary , more educated citizens often res@@ ent being told by experts what science regar@@ ds as truth .
having had access to knowledge , they feel empowered enough to critici@@ ze the co@@ g@@ no@@ sc@@ ent@@ i and develop views of their own .
climate change – which the scientific community overwhel@@ m@@ ingly regar@@ ds it as a major threat – is a case in point .
according to a 2015 pe@@ w research survey , the three countries where concern is the weak@@ est are the us , australia , and canada , whereas the three in which it is the strongest are brazil , peru , and burkina faso .
yet average years of schooling are 12@@ .@@ 5 for the first group and six for the second .
evi@@ dently , education alone is not the reason for this difference in perception .
if the problem is here to stay , we had better do more to address it . first , we need more discipline on the part of the community of experts .
the intellectual discipline that characteri@@ zes research is often lac@@ king in policy discussions .
humility , rigorous procedures , the prevention of conflicts of interest , an ability to acknowledge mistakes and , yes , punishment of frau@@ dul@@ ent behavior are needed to regain citizens ’ trust .
second , there is a case for re@@ vis@@ ing curricul@@ a to equi@@ p future citizens with the intellectual tools they will need to distinguish between fact and fiction .
society has everything to gain from citizens whose minds are both less suspicious and more critical .
finally , we need better ven@@ ues for dialogue and informed debate .
serious magazines , gener@@ al-@@ interest journals , and newspapers traditionally filled the space between the e@@ ther of peer-@@ reviewed journals and the deep sea of ho@@ axes ; yet they all struggle to survive the digital revolution .
other ven@@ ues , perhaps new institutions , are needed to fill that space .
what is clear is that democracy cannot thrive if it is left empty .
new york – with most of the world focused on economic inst@@ ability and ane@@ mic growth in the advanced countries , developing countries , with the possible exception of china , have received relatively little attention .
but , as a group , emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market economies have been nega@@ tively affected by the recent down@@ turn in developed countries .
the major emerging economies were the world ’ s main growth engines following the erup@@ tion of the financial crisis in 2008 , and , to some extent , they still are .
but their resilience has always been a function of their ability to generate enough incremental aggregate demand to support their growth , without having to make up for a large loss of demand in developed countries .
china , in turn , is a major market for final products , inter@@ mediate goods ( including those used to produce finished exports ) , and commodities . the ri@@ pple effect from europe ’ s st@@ alling economy has thus spread rapidly to the rest of asia and beyond .
moreover , not only is the tra@@ dable sector of japan ’ s economy highly vulnerable to a slow@@ down in china , but the recent conflict over the sen@@ kak@@ u / dia@@ oy@@ u islands raises the prospect of economic de@@ cou@@ pling .
apart from that , japanese economic performance is set to remain weak , because the non-@@ tra@@ dable side is not a strong growth engine .
the key questions for the world economy today , then , are how significant the growth slow@@ down will be , and how long it will last .
with wise policy responses , the impact is likely to be relatively mild and short-@@ lived .
european banks , traditionally a major source of trade finance , have pulled back dramatically , o@@ wing to capit@@ al-@@ adequ@@ acy problems caused by sovereig@@ n-@@ debt capital losses and , in some cases , losses from real-@@ estate len@@ ding .
this vacuum could reduce trade flows even if demand were present .
in asia , especially , filling the vacuum with alternative finan@@ cing mechanisms has become a high priority .
in particular , although china ’ s tra@@ dable sector is highly exposed to developed economies , the government is likely to accept some short-@@ run slow@@ down , rather than adopting potentially distor@@ ting stimulus measures .
given the risk of re-@@ in@@ fl@@ ating asset bubbles , no one should expect a dramatic e@@ asing of credit of the type that followed the 2008 mel@@ t@@ down .
an accelerated publi@@ c-@@ investment program that avo@@ ids low-@@ return projects is not out of the question .
but the best and most likely responses are those that accelerate domestic consumption growth by increasing household income , effectively deploy income from state-@@ owned assets , and streng@@ then china ’ s soci@@ al-@@ security systems in order to reduce pre@@ cau@@ tionary saving . indeed , these are all key components of china ’ s recently adopted 12th five-@@ year plan .
admit@@ tedly , china ’ s major systemic reforms a@@ wait the country ’ s leadership transition , now expected in november .
by most accounts , the pace of reform directed at expanding the market side of the economy needs to pick up quickly to achieve the ambitious economic and social goals of the next five years .
some countries have bu@@ cked the global trend .
indonesia , for example , has experienced accelerating growth , with rising business and consumer confidence boo@@ sting investment to almost 33 % of gdp .
likewise , brazil ’ s growth has been dented , but now looks set to recover . moreover , overall economic performance in brazil masks an important fact : growth rates have been substan@@ tially higher among the country ’ s poorer citizens , and unemployment is declining .
the aggregate growth rate does not capture this inclu@@ si@@ veness , and thus under@@ states the pace of economic and social progress .
the main challenge for brazil is to increase its investment rate from 18 % of gdp currently to closer to 25 % , thereby sustaining rapid growth and economic diversi@@ fication .
commodity dependence , even with the creation of consider@@ able domestic value added , remains high .
econom@@ ic@@ -@@ growth rates in other syste@@ mi@@ cally large countries , including turkey and mexico , have ris@@ en as well , despite european and us head@@ winds .
many african countries , too , are showing a broad pattern of sound macro@@ economic fundament@@ als , durable growth acceleration , economic diversi@@ fication , and investor confidence .
the out@@ look for india ’ s economy remains more un@@ certain .
while growth slowed recently from very high rates – o@@ wing to a combination of exposure to develop@@ ed-@@ country weakness , internal loss of reform momentum , and declining investor confidence – that trend appears to be rever@@ sing after recent decisi@@ ve correc@@ tive moves by the government .
the main question is whether india ’ s parliament will pass crucial legislation or remain paralyzed by hyper-@@ partisan , sc@@ and@@ al-@@ fu@@ eled in@@ fighting .
combining this general picture with more general develop@@ ing-@@ country trends – rising incomes , rapid growth in middle classes , expanding trade and investment flows , bil@@ ateral and regional free-@@ trade agre@@ ements , and a growing share of global gdp ( roughly 50 % ) – these economies ’ growth momentum should return relatively rapidly , over the next 1-@@ 2 years .
most of the down@@ side risk to this scenario lies in the syste@@ mi@@ cally important economies of europe , the us , and china .
to der@@ a@@ il emerging economies ’ growth momentum at this stage probably would require either an additional major demand shock from the advanced economies , or some kind of failure in china ’ s leadership transition that im@@ pe@@ des systemic reform and affects the country ’ s growth .
not@@ with@@ standing low growth fore@@ ca@@ sts for the entire developed world , these systemic risks , taken individually and in combination , appear to be declining ( though certainly not to the point that they can be dis@@ missed ) .
on balance , then , the multi@@ speed growth patterns of the past decade are likely to continue .
even as the developed economies experience an extended period of belo@@ w-@@ trend growth , the emerging economies will remain an important growth engine .
why did economists not fores@@ ee the crisis ?
chicago – at the height of the financial crisis , the queen of england asked my friends at the london school of economics a simple question , but one for which there is no easy answer : why did academic economists fail to fores@@ ee the crisis ?
several responses to that qu@@ ery exist .
one is that economists lac@@ ked models that could account for the behavior that led to the crisis .
another is that economists were blin@@ ker@@ ed by an ideology according to which a free and un@@ fe@@ ttered market could do no wrong .
finally , an answer that is gaining ground is that the system bri@@ bed economists to stay silent .
in my view , the truth lies elsewhere .
it is not true that we academics did not have useful models to explain what happened .
if you believe that the crisis was caused by a shortage of liqui@@ dity , we had plenty of models analyzing liqui@@ dity shor@@ tages and their effects on financial institutions .
if you believe that the blame lies with gree@@ dy bankers and un@@ thinking investors , l@@ ul@@ led by the promise of a government bail@@ out , or with a market driven crazy by irrational exu@@ ber@@ ance , we had studied all this too , in great detail .
economists even analyzed the political economy of regulation and deregu@@ lation , so we could have understood why some us politicians pushed the private sector into finan@@ cing affordable housing , while others der@@ eg@@ ulated private finance .
yet , somehow , we did not bring all this understanding to bear and collectively shout our warn@@ ings .
perhaps the reason was ideology : we were too we@@ d@@ ded to the idea that markets are efficient , market participants are rational , and high prices are justi@@ fied by economic fundament@@ als .
but some of this criticism of “ market fundament@@ alism ” reflects a mis@@ understanding .
the dominant “ efficient markets theory ” says only that markets reflect what is publicly known , and that it is hard to make money off markets consistently – something veri@@ fied by the hit that most investor portfoli@@ os took in the crisis .
the theory does not say that markets cannot plum@@ met if the news is bad , or if investors become ris@@ k-@@ a@@ verse .
cri@@ tics argue that the fundament@@ als were de@@ terior@@ ating in plain sight , and that the market ( and economists ) ignored it .
we cannot point to a lonely cas@@ sand@@ ra like robert sh@@ il@@ ler of yale university , who regularly argued that house prices were unsustainable , as proof that the truth was ignored .
there are always na@@ y@@ sa@@ yers , and they are often wrong .
there were many more economists who believed that house prices , though high , were unlikely to fall across the board .
of course , these expectations could have been distorted by ideology – it is hard to get into the past minds of economists .
but there is a better reason to be skeptical of explanations rel@@ ying on ideology .
as a group , neither behavioral economists , who think that market efficiency is a joke , nor progressive economists , who di@@ str@@ ust free markets , predicted the crisis .
could it be corruption ?
some academic economists consu@@ lt for banks or rating agencies , give speeches to investor conferences , serve as expert witn@@ esses , and carry out sponsored research .
it would be natural to suspect us of bias .
the bias could be implic@@ it : our worldview is shaped by what our friends in industry believe .
or it may be an explicit bias : an economist might write a report that is influenced by what a sponsor wants to hear , or give testimony that is purely mer@@ cen@@ ary .
there are enough instances of possible bias that the issue cannot be ignored .
one reme@@ dy would be to ban all interaction between economists and the corporate world .
but if economists were confined to the ivory tower , we might be un@@ biased , but we would also be ignorant of practic@@ alities – and thus even less capable of predicting problems .
one way to restore trust may be dis@@ closure – for economists to de@@ clare a mon@@ etary interest in a particular analysis and , more generally , to explain who pays us .
a number of universities are moving in this direction .
but i believe that corruption is not the main reason that the profession missed the crisis .
most economists have very little interaction with the corporate world , and these “ un@@ biased ” economists were no better at fore@@ casting the crisis .
i would argue that three factors largely explain our collective failure : specialization , the difficulty of fore@@ casting , and the dis@@ engagement of much of the profession from the real world .
like medicine , economics has become highly com@@ part@@ ment@@ alized – macro@@ economists typically do not pay attention to what financial economists or real-@@ estate economists study , and vice versa .
yet , to see the crisis coming would have required someone who knew about each of these areas – just as it takes a good general practition@@ er to recognize an exotic disease .
because the profession rewards only careful , well-@@ supported , but necessarily narrow analysis , few economists try to span sub-@@ fields .
even if they did , they would shy away from fore@@ casting .
the main advantage that academic economists have over professional fore@@ ca@@ sters may be their greater awareness of established relationships between factors .
what is hardest to forecast , though , are turning points – when the old relationships break down .
while there may be some factors that signal turning points – a run@@ -up in short-term leverage and asset prices , for example , often pres@@ ages a bust – they are not in@@ fal@@ li@@ ble predic@@ tors of trouble to come .
the me@@ ager professional rewards for bread@@ th , coupled with the in@@ accuracy and repu@@ tational risk associated with fore@@ casting , leads to dis@@ engagement for most academics .
and it may well be that academic economists have little to say about short-term economic movements , so that fore@@ casting , with all its errors , is best left to professional fore@@ ca@@ sters .
the danger is that dis@@ engagement from short-term developments leads academic economists to ignore medi@@ um-@@ term trends that they can address .
if so , the true reason why academics missed the crisis could be far more mundane than inadequate models , ideological blindness , or corruption , and thus far more wor@@ ris@@ ome ; many simply were not paying attention !
islam@@ abad – the men who attempted to kill 14@@ -year-old mal@@ ala you@@ saf@@ za@@ i on october 9 knew what she represented .
her active involvement since the age of el@@ even in campaigning for the rights of girls in her region to be educated was well known .
mal@@ ala ’ s efforts , while applau@@ ded by the west and some se@@ gments of pakistani society , were deeply res@@ ented by the obsc@@ ur@@ anti@@ st forces that go by the name of the taliban , which in pakistan calls itself te@@ hri@@ k-@@ e-@@ taliban pakistan .
their choice of name is an ironic one , for taliban , an arabic word , means those seeking to be educated , whereas the taliban ’ s principal aim is to keep muslim societies backward so that they can be persu@@ aded to adopt a seven@@ th-century version of islam .
education , particularly of women , stands in the way of achieving this goal .
but the attack on mal@@ ala will , most likely , have an effect that is opposite to that intended by those who carried it out .
several religious leaders joined the chor@@ us of con@@ dem@@ nation that followed the attack on mal@@ ala .
in a sign of unity , a council of sun@@ ni muslim scholars in the eastern city of la@@ hore issued a fat@@ wa , signed by 50 cler@@ ics , saying that the justi@@ fi@@ cations c@@ ited by the girl ’ s attac@@ kers were “ devi@@ ant ” and had no basis in islamic law .
the taliban seem to have been taken ab@@ ack by the public and media reaction to the attack .
dawn , pakistan ’ s lar@@ gest@@ -@@ circulation engli@@ sh-@@ language newspaper , reported that ha@@ kim@@ ul@@ la@@ h me@@ h@@ su@@ d , the pakistani taliban ’ s leader , had ordered his foot soldiers to target media organizations in kar@@ ach@@ i , la@@ hore , ra@@ wal@@ pin@@ di , and islam@@ abad in response .
several tv channels had been extremely critical of the taliban ’ s assau@@ l@@ ts on pakistani society .
the extremi@@ sts wanted to silence the majority that was waking up to the existential threat that radical islam poses to their country .
there is a widespread belief that pakistani women are doing poorly when it comes to ob@@ taining education .
that impression is correct to some extent .
the overall literacy rate for women is und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly low – much lower than that for men .
but male education and literacy in pakistan is not very high , either .
although pakistan is a sig@@ nat@@ ory to the united nations millennium development goals , which include at@@ tainment of universal literacy for both boys and girls by 2015 , the country is far from achieving the target , with literacy rates of 70 % for boys and only 45 % for girls in 2010 .
that said , over the 17@@ -@@ year period from 1993 to 2010 , the number of girls en@@ rolled in primary education increased from 3.@@ 7 million to 8.@@ 3 million .
this impli@@ es a rate of growth of 6.@@ 7 % a year , about 2.5 times the rate of increase in the number of girls entering the primar@@ y-@@ school age co@@ h@@ ort .
but , even with this growth rate , girls still accoun@@ ted for just 4@@ 4.@@ 3 % of the total number of en@@ rolled students in 2010 .
it is in higher education that pakistani women have made extraordinary progress in recent years .
their share of total college en@@ roll@@ ment has increased from 36 % to 57 % over the last couple of decades , rising from less than 15,000 in 1993 to 4@@ 3@@ 6,000 in 2010 .
the proportion of women receiving higher education is approaching the 60 % mark , o@@ wing to an impressive 28 % annual rate of growth in their en@@ roll@@ ment numbers in 2010 , up from a 20 % increase in 1993 .
although a very large number of girls drop out after primary school , the number comple@@ ting higher education is now large .
this year , roughly 7@@ 50,000 women will graduate from pakistan ’ s institutions of higher learning .
if the current rate of growth is main@@ tained , by 2015 the number of women comple@@ ting higher education could exce@@ ed 1.5 million a year .
had mal@@ ala died , she eventually would have been forgotten – another victim of the war that the extremi@@ sts are wa@@ ging in pakistan .
her death would have added just one more individual to the tens of thousands who have already been killed in terrorist attacks across the country .
mal@@ ala ’ s survival – and possibly even full recovery – provides a vibrant symbol for a troubled country .
she will begin to be identified with the change that is already underway .
it is not often recognized that women in pakistan – at least those of a certain class – are receiving the kind of education that enables them to enter the modern sectors of the economy or to become entrepreneurs .
in education , numbers make a revolution .
the extremi@@ sts understand that all too well .
why do economies stop growing ?
mil@@ an – over the years , advanced and developing countries have experim@@ ented , sometimes deliberately and frequently in@@ adver@@ tently , with a variety of approaches to growth .
unfortunately , many of these strategies have turned out to have buil@@ t-in limitations or dec@@ eler@@ ators – what one might call elements of un@@ sustainability .
and avoiding serious damage and difficult reco@@ ver@@ ies requires us to get a lot better at recognizing these self-@@ limit@@ ing growth patterns early on .
here are some of the items in a growing library of dec@@ eler@@ ating growth models .
in developing countries , import substit@@ ution as a way to jum@@ p-@@ start economic diversi@@ fication can work for a while ; but , over time , as productivity growth la@@ gs and compar@@ ative advantage is over-@@ ri@@ dden , growth grin@@ ds to a halt .
small , open economies are naturally somewhat specialized , which leaves them vulnerable to sho@@ cks and vola@@ tili@@ ty .
but , in terms of growth and living standards , the cost of economic diversi@@ fication , when implemented by protecting domestic industries from foreign competition , eventually out@@ weighs the benefits .
it is better to allow specialization , and build effective social safety nets and support systems to protect people and families during economic transi@@ tions .
such “ structural flexibility ” is better adapted to enabling the broad changes that rapidly evolving technological and global economic forces require .
mis@@ management of natur@@ al-@@ resource wealth under@@ pins an especially potent self-@@ limit@@ ing pattern of growth and development .
if invested in infrastructure , education , and external financial assets , natur@@ al-@@ resource revenues can accelerate growth .
but , too often , such revenues dist@@ ort economic incentives , which come to favor r@@ ent-@@ seeking and interfere with the diversi@@ fication that is essential for growth .
more recently , many advanced countries have discovered a “ new ” set of growth models with buil@@ t-in structural limitations : exc@@ essive private or public consumption , or both , usually accompanied and enabled by rising debt and in@@ fl@@ ated asset prices , and a corresponding decline in investment .
this approach appears to work until domestic aggregate demand can no longer sustain growth and employment , at which point it ends in either gradu@@ al stag@@ nation or a violent financial and economic crisis .
( in fact , many developing countries have learned this the hard way , but the lessons seem not to have crossed over to advanced countries . )
but the opposite of the exc@@ essi@@ ve-@@ consumption model – exc@@ essive reli@@ ance on investment to generate aggregate demand – is also a self-@@ limit@@ ing growth pattern .
when the private and social returns of investment dimin@@ ish too much , growth cannot be sustained in@@ definitely , even though rising investment rates can sustain aggregate demand for a while .
alter@@ ing this growth pattern is a significant part of the challenge that china now faces .
rising inequality in either opportunity or outcomes ( and often both ) also poses threats to the sustainability of growth patterns .
while people in a wide range of countries accept some degree of market@@ -@@ determined income variation , based on differential talents and personal preferences , there are limits .
when they are bre@@ ached , the typical result is a sense of un@@ fairness , followed by resistance and , ultimately , political choices that address the inequality , though sometimes in counter-@@ productive , grow@@ th-@@ im@@ pe@@ ding ways .
perhaps the largest long-@@ run sustainability issue concerns the adequ@@ acy of the global economy ’ s natur@@ al-@@ resource base : output will more than triple over the coming two or three decades , as high-@@ growth developing economies ’ four billion people conver@@ ge toward advan@@ ce@@ d-@@ country income levels and consumption patterns .
existing econom@@ ic@@ -@@ development strategies will require significant adap@@ tion to accommo@@ date this kind of growth .
some adaptation will occur naturally , as rising energy and other commodity prices generate incentives to econom@@ ize or seek alternatives .
but the un-@@ pri@@ ced environmental extern@@ alities – global warming and water deple@@ tion , for example – will require serious attention , not myo@@ pic , re@@ active mind@@ sets and approaches .
all of these self-@@ limit@@ ing growth patterns tend to have three things in common . first , in one or several dimensions , some part of the economy ’ s base of tangible , intangible , and natur@@ al-@@ resource assets is being run down .
i would include social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on as part of the asset base : it is the one that is de@@ preci@@ ated by exc@@ essive inequality .
measurement issues play an important role here .
it is easier to run down something that is partly invisible because it is not regularly or effectively measured .
expanded measurement of the dimensions of economic , social , and environmental performance is necessary to bro@@ aden awareness of sustainability issues .
expectations come to exce@@ ed reality , and res@@ et@@ ting the system to a sustainable growth pattern is difficult .
after all , past investment short@@ falls have to be made up and fu@@ ture-@@ oriented investments under@@ taken simultaneously – a double burden that must be borne by the current generation .
an inability to resolve the distribu@@ tional and fairness problem can produce gridlock , paralysis , and pro@@ lon@@ ged stag@@ nation .
finally , many of these fla@@ wed growth patterns involve fiscal distress .
contrary to the prevail@@ ing wisdom nowadays , some degree of ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian demand management in the transition to a more sustainable growth pattern is not in conflict with restor@@ ing fiscal balance over a sensible time period .
on the contrary , applied both individually and together , fiscal stimulus and con@@ soli@@ dation are necessary parts of the adju@@ st@@ ment process .
but they are not sufficient .
the crucial missing pieces are a shift in the structure of accessible aggregate demand and restor@@ ation of those parts of the economy ’ s asset base that have been run down , im@@ plying the need for structural change and investment .
why does pain hurt ?
pain is a familiar experience for everyone , but its nature remains a troubling en@@ ig@@ ma for suff@@ er@@ ers and scientists alike .
why do different patients who under@@ go the same surgical procedure experience marke@@ dly different post-@@ operative pain ?
how is it that people with little or no medical explanation for a persistent pain become partially or totally disabled by it , even with extensive and resour@@ ce@@ ful treatment ?
many doctors would like to think of pain as a simple sensation that use@@ fully calls disease or injury to our attention .
but pain resi@@ sts explanation as a simple sensation , just as music resi@@ sts explanation as simple t@@ ones .
a contemporary non-@@ medical writer described the qualities of intense pain as including extreme un@@ pleas@@ ant@@ ness , an ability to anni@@ hil@@ ate complex thoughts and other feelings , an ability to destroy language , and a strong resistance to obje@@ c@@ tification .
she reminds physicians that , for the person suffering intense pain , what domin@@ ates awareness above all else is a powerful negative emotion .
most of the time , pain occurs after simple nerve end@@ ings detect tissue injury in various ways and generate signals that travel to the spinal cord and from there to the brain .
for many years , scientists thought that these signals traveled along a few well-@@ defined rou@@ tes to reach a rela@@ y station in the brain called the thal@@ am@@ us .
from there , scientists believed , the signals went on to the part of the brain &apos;s cortex that managed body awareness , and somehow the cortex turned them into conscious experience .
unfortunately , the neural road@@ map for sensory messages of tissue injury explains only a part of how we experience pain .
it cannot explain why pain involves emotion and cognition .
psychologists are quick to point out that whenever humans experience strong emotions , cogni@@ tions-@@ -@@ thoughts , memories , expectations , beliefs , and interpretation of the situ@@ ation@@ -@@ -@@ help form the experience .
in other words , pain may begin with a neural message of tissue injury or disease , but it is the end product of complex events within the brain .
the conscious experience of pain involves emotion and cognition as well as sensation .
we always experience pain as a dist@@ ressing thing happening in some part of the body , in some particular circum@@ stance , and usually it has a particular meaning .
new evidence points to more complex mechanisms for pain that involve higher levels of the brain .
injury messages , it seems , travel to many brain structures , not just to sen@@ sa@@ tion-@@ generating areas .
some injury messages directly ex@@ ci@@ te brain structures that produce emotion , and these in turn stimulate areas of the brain that create the meaning of the immediate situation .
pain emerges into awareness only after sensory , emotional , and cognitive processes have combined to form a coherent , integrated pattern of experience .
as we might expect , sen@@ sa@@ tion-@@ generating areas are active , but so are structures in emotion@@ -@@ generating areas of the brain and structures related to attention and thinking .
even motor structures that enable so-called &quot; fight or flight &quot; responses to a dangerous situation become active .
such studies show that simple signals of tissue injury generate many simul@@ taneous brain processes .
these processes combine to produce the private and un@@ pleasant bo@@ di@@ ly awareness that we call pain .
because emotions and cogni@@ tions are an intrinsic part of the experience of pain , people differ greatly in their responses to a common injury , such as a standard surgical operation .
individual memory , beliefs , cultural background , and personal meaning all shape pain , so that an injury that is horrible to one person can be a minor dis@@ comfort to another .
psychological researchers are beginning to investigate why individual patients form the experience of pain differently when they experience similar tissue injury .
why seemingly healthy body areas can hurt persi@@ stently , and thereby dis@@ able a person , still elu@@ des explanation .
some researchers are finding that long-@@ lasting injury signals in neural pathways can change the way those pathways function , and over long periods of time , rel@@ ent@@ less signals of injury can even alter neural structures themselves .
the altered parts of the nervous system might keep generating injury messages , even after the original injury has heal@@ ed .
other researchers apply the same principle to higher levels of the brain .
memory of tissue injury rather than new messages of injury might contribute to the formation of pain , and in this way the brain might continuously create pain in the absence of its original cause .
alterna@@ tively , the brain might turn minor sign@@ aling of tissue injury into a major pain by mixing cognitive and emotional memories into the formation of the pain experience .
research on pain is progr@@ essing on many fron@@ ts .
perhaps the most challenging is that of understanding how the brain integr@@ ates sensory , emotional , and cognitive processes when an injury occurs to form the complex bo@@ di@@ ly awareness that we know as pain .
un@@ locking this secret may help doctors prevent , treat , or eliminate some chronic pain disorders .
why do jews succeed ?
simon ku@@ z@@ nets , one of the twen@@ tieth century ’ s great economists , was a pioneer of human-@@ capital theory . not long before he died , ku@@ z@@ nets recommen@@ ded to a young colleague that one ought study the role of jews in economic life .
by and large , economists and other social scientists have negle@@ cted the history of jews and capitalism , for reasons that are understandable , though un@@ convincing . for most economists , the extent to which modern capitalism has been shaped by earlier cultural pre@@ dis@@ positions is a source of puzz@@ lement at best , if not merely a factor to be dis@@ missed .
when economists examine “ human capital , ” they prefer measurable criteria such as years of schooling . to the extent that human capital involves character traits and varieties of “ know-how ” that are transmitted within the real@@ ms of the family and the community , rather than by formal education , it becomes both method@@ ologically elu@@ sive and difficult to manipulate by public policy .
a look at the historical experience of the jews shows that while most jews were mi@@ red in poverty at the beginning of the twen@@ tieth century , over time they ten@@ ded to do dis@@ proportion@@ ately well in societies that allowed them to compete on an equal basis . that was the case first in central and western europe , and then in the united states .
in search of economic ni@@ ches not already occupied by others , jews frequently created markets for new products and services . they pione@@ ered new retail institutions , from department stores to box stores .
the fact that jews were long a minority subject to discrimin@@ ation is sometimes given as a reason for their tendency to devote themselves to commerce , finance , and the professions . yet not all min@@ orities long subject to discrimin@@ ation necessarily succeed under conditions of market competition .
there are a number of ways to account for jews ’ dis@@ proportion@@ ate achievement . for one thing , jews had more experience with commerce than most other groups , and the tac@@ it knowledge of buying , selling , and calculating advantage that was passed on in families with ties to business helps explain why jews ten@@ ded to be better at it .
moreover , in much of europe , jews had long been exclu@@ ded from most of the established economy of land ownership , and from many other fields that were reserved for christians . so they learned to be on the loo@@ k@@ out for new opportunities in under@@ served markets , working as pe@@ dd@@ lers , for example , or creating new products , or new forms of marketing .
jews were spread across many countries , but to some extent shared a common language and a sense of common fate . so they were more aware of distant opportunities , had more international contacts , and were dis@@ proportion@@ ately active in international trade .
in addition , jews had a religious culture that promot@@ ed universal adult literacy – at least for men – and a culture that respected book learning . those attitudes and dis@@ positions were transferred from religious texts to secular forms of education .
such factors provide a sense of why attention to the history of jews under capitalism helps us to understand capitalism more generally . it reminds us that much of success in a capit@@ alist society is based on cultural and historical factors that produce qualities such as innova@@ tiveness , willingness to tolerate risk , and willingness to de@@ fer gratification through savings and education .
these cultural traits are difficult to quantify , so economists are uncomfortable in dealing with them . they are often passed down within families , so they elu@@ de social policies that are based on the notion that equality of opportunity can be created by government action .
exploring the economic history of the jews also reminds us that groups that are dis@@ proportion@@ ately successful are met by different political reactions . societies long oriented to economic dynam@@ ism tend to welcome the economically successful , viewing them as a source of mutual gains .
but cultures that tend to res@@ ent the economically successful – either as an aff@@ ron@@ t to equality , or on the implic@@ it assumption that the economic gains of some must be at the expense of others – tend to be more hostile toward jews and given to con@@ spir@@ atori@@ al theories to explain their economic success . most societies lie somewhere along a spectrum between these two poles .
why do smart people live longer ?
edinburgh – people with higher intelligence test scores in childhood and early adul@@ thood tend to live longer .
this result has been found among people from australia , denmark , england and wales , scotland , sweden , and the united states . in fact , it has been found within every population that has been studied .
indeed , the impact of intelligence on mortality ri@@ vals well-known risk factors for illness and death , such as high blood pressure , being overweight , high blood glucose , and high cholester@@ ol .
its effect is almost as important as that of smoking .
differences in human intelligence have environmental and genetic causes .
an intelligence test score in early life is partly a record of what the environment has wr@@ ought on the brain and the rest of the body up to that time .
babies who have lower birth wei@@ ghts , for example , are more prone to chronic illnesses later in life .
they also have , on average , slightly lower intelligence .
but tests of whether birth weight might explain some of the link between intelligence and mortality have found no connection .
parents ’ occupa@@ tions are also related to their child ’ s intelligence and later risk of illness : children from more privileged backgrounds tend to have higher intelligence and better health , and to live longer .
however , there is no convincing evidence that par@@ ental background explains the link between higher intelligence and longer life .
other researchers have viewed intelligence test scores as possibly more than just an indic@@ ator of an efficient brain .
after all , the brain is just one organ of the body , so people whose brains work well in early life may also have other organs and systems that are more efficient than others ’ .
but this “ system integrity ” idea is somewhat vague and difficult to test .
the best we have done to date has been to examine whether people ’ s reaction speeds are related to intelligence and to mortality .
they are .
re@@ ac@@ tion-@@ time tests involve little thinking , and merely ask people to respond as fast as they can to simple stimuli .
people who react faster have , on average , higher intelligence scores and live longer .
but we need to think of better measures of the body ’ s integrity to test this idea more fully .
a third potential explanation is that intelligence is about good decision-making .
every day , as we live our lives , we make decisions about our health : what , when , and how much to eat ; how much exercise to take ; how to look after ourselves if we have an illness ; and so forth .
therefore , the reason that intelligence and death are linked might be that people with higher intelligence in childhood make better decisions about health , and have healthier behaviors .
as adults , they tend to have better di@@ ets , exercise more , gain less weight , have fewer han@@ go@@ vers , and so on .
so far , so good .
but we do not yet have the full story .
there have not been any studies with data on childhood intelligence , lots of subsequ@@ ent data on adult health behaviors , and then a long-term follo@@ w-@@ up for deaths .
and only such a study could tell us whether it is these healthy behaviors that explain the link between intelligence and death .
a fourth type of explanation is that people with higher intelligence in childhood tend to at@@ tain better educational qualifi@@ cations , work in more professional jobs , have higher incomes , and live in more afflu@@ ent areas .
these variables are related to living longer , too .
so , perhaps that ’ s it : higher intelligence buys people into safer and more heal@@ th-@@ friendly environments .
certainly , in some studies , social class in adul@@ thood seems to explain a lot of the link between intelligence and death .
the problem is that this “ explanation ” is statistical .
we are still not sure whether , say , education and occupation “ explain ” the effect of intelligence on health , or whether they are , in effect , merely surro@@ gate measures of intelligence .
researchers have also search@@ ed for clues about the intelligen@@ ce-@@ mortality link in specific types of death .
this has been revealing .
lower intelligence in early life is associated with a greater likelihood of dying from , for example , cardiovascular disease , accidents , suicide , and hom@@ i@@ cide .
the evidence for cancer is less certain .
as we have come across these specific findings , we have realized that each link might need a different explanation .
finally , we know that how intelligent we are and how long we shall live are caused by both environmental and genetic influences .
there are experimental designs , using twins , that can find out the extent to which intelligence and mortality are linked because they share environmental and genetic influences .
among the most informa@@ tive exercis@@ es we can under@@ take in cognitive epidemi@@ ology is to ob@@ tain a large group of twins on whom there is data on ear@@ ly-@@ life intelligence and who were tracked for a long time to find out who had died .
we haven ’ t yet come across a large enough group of twins with such data .
finding one is a priority .
the ultimate aim of this research is to find out what intelligent people have and do that enables them to live longer .
once we know that , we will be able to share and apply that knowledge with the aim of achieving optimal health for all .
growth out of time
cambridge – robert gordon of nor@@ th@@ western university is a distingu@@ ished economist whose work in macro@@ economics and studies of long-term economic growth have properly earned him high regard .
so his recent exercise in specu@@ lative future history , which asks whether economic growth in the united states has come to an end , has attracted much favor@@ able attention .
but a basic fla@@ w in gordon ’ s argument is immediately apparent – and becomes gl@@ ar@@ ingly so on closer exam@@ ination .
the core of his article contra@@ sts the transformational impact of ir # 1 and , especially , ir # 2 on per capita gdp and the quality of life with the relatively trivial consequences of ir # 3 .
the vulnerability of gordon ’ s argument is his shor@@ ten@@ ed time horizon for ir # 3 . consider the following four sentences in his paper :
· “ both the first two revolutions required about 100 years for their full effects to per@@ col@@ ate through the economy . ”
· “ at a minimum , it took 150 years for ir # 1 to have its full range of effects . ”
· “ the inventions of ir # 2 were so important … that they took a full 100 years to have their main effect . ”
· “ … &#91; t &#93; he productivity impact of ir # 3 evapor@@ ated after only eight years , compared to the 81 years ( 18@@ 9@@ 1-@@ 197@@ 2 ) required for the benefits of ir # 2 to have their full impact … ”
the last sentence is crucial : gordon cuts off ir # 3 circa 2005 – that is , 45 years from its onset , but less than half the time allowed for ir # 1 and ir # 2 to run their respe@@ ctive courses .
to take a sali@@ ent example from the prior industrial revolutions , this is as if the impact of the rail@@ roads on the us economy were to be measured as of 18@@ 73 , 45 years after construction began on america ’ s first line , the bal@@ ti@@ more &amp; ohio .
in 18@@ 73 , the re@@ tail@@ er mont@@ gom@@ ery ward was just a year old , and the first se@@ ars ro@@ e@@ bu@@ ck cat@@ alo@@ gue was still 20 years away .
together , these companies invented mail order as the “ killer app ” of the railroad age , creating a contin@@ ental market for consumer goods , with all of the economies of scale that followed .
or , to take another example , what if we stopped measuring the economic impact of electri@@ fication only 45 years after the first generating plant , thomas edison ’ s pearl street station , became operational in 18@@ 82 ? at that point , america ’ s manufacturing industries were just discovering the benefits of flexible ( re ) configuration , which enabled distribution of generated electric power , while america ’ s hom@@ e-@@ appli@@ ance industry was in its in@@ fancy .
gordon asser@@ ts that “ the era of computers replacing human labor was largely over ” during the past decade .
innovation in information and communications technology ( ic@@ t ) focused first on electronic commerce , “ itself largely completed by 2005 . ” after that , “ labor@@ -@@ saving innovation ” took a back seat to “ a succ@@ ession of entertainment and communication devices that do the same things as we could do before , but now in smaller and more convenient pack@@ ages . ”
in thus trun@@ c@@ ating and trivi@@ alizing the ongoing ic@@ t revolution , gordon mis@@ ses two fundamental processes .
first , and most evident , the rise of e-@@ commerce is far from over . in the us , the most advanced country in this respect , e-@@ commerce has just reached 10 % of total retail spending , and is continuing to grow at double-@@ digit rates through the slow recovery from the great recession .
from the early days of the computer revolution , researchers and popul@@ ari@@ zers en@@ visi@@ oned “ artificial intelligence ” as the ultimate killer app ( literally , in the case of the computer hal in the film 2001 : a space odys@@ sey ) .
decades of frustration are now yiel@@ ding to success : the application of sophisticated statistical techniques to the accelerating accumulation of unprecedented quantities of so-called big data that the internet simultaneously generates and captures .
for proof of artificial intelligent “ life , ” consider the “ virtual assi@@ stan@@ ts ” popul@@ ating smart phones , beginning – but just beginning – with apple ’ s si@@ ri .
the next wave of ir # 3 ’ s consequences can be disc@@ ern@@ ed in systems that capture the intention behind a search request and couple it to a completed trans@@ action , and in the application of predi@@ ctive analy@@ tics to industrial supply chains and service pro@@ visi@@ oning .
if these innovations ’ pro@@ spe@@ ctive impact on productivity and gdp growth cannot be quanti@@ fied , well , that is the way it is with future history .
fla@@ wed as gordon ’ s reading of ir # 3 is , his conclu@@ ding concern for the future of innovation in the us is well founded .
of the as@@ sor@@ ted “ head@@ winds ” that he c@@ ites , the enormous increase in inequality and the plat@@ e@@ au reached in educational at@@ tainment represent threats that differenti@@ ate america ’ s position from that of other advanced countries .
but gordon ignor@@ es the greatest threat to continued us global leadership in innovation : the dele@@ gi@@ ti@@ mation over the past generation of the state ’ s role as an economic actor .
as i illustrate and analyze at length in my new book , doing capitalism in the innovation economy : markets , specu@@ lation and the state , the state has become central to the innovation economy ’ s dynamics .
it funds the up@@ stream research that generates discovery and invention ; supports the creation of new networks , from can@@ als to the internet ; and serves as a creative customer for innovative products , as it did during the computer revolution ’ s nas@@ cence .
the state must also preserve continuity in the market economy when the specu@@ lative bubble that has funded its transformation bur@@ sts .
and here , too , gordon disap@@ points .
the only reference to government in his paper is not even to this stabili@@ zing role . rather , it is to the asser@@ ted head@@ wind represented by the very debt in@@ cur@@ red to prevent the global financial crisis of 2008 from trig@@ gering a second great depression .
the truth about sovereig@@ n@@ ty
cambridge – in the french parliament ’ s recent debate on europe ’ s new fiscal treaty , the country ’ s soci@@ alist government ve@@ he@@ ment@@ ly denied that rati@@ fication of the treaty would under@@ mine french sovereig@@ n@@ ty .
it places “ not one constra@@ int on the level of public spending , ” jean-@@ marc ay@@ rau@@ lt , the prime minister , asser@@ ted . “ budget sovereig@@ n@@ ty remains in the parliament of the french republic . ”
as ay@@ rau@@ lt was trying to reas@@ sure his skeptical colleagues , including many members of his own party , european commission@@ er for competition jo@@ aqu@@ in al@@ muni@@ a was delivering a similar message to his fellow social democrats in brus@@ sels .
to succeed , he argued , europe must prove wrong those who believe there is a conflict between globalization and sovereig@@ n@@ ty .
nobody likes to give up national sovereig@@ n@@ ty , least of all , it seems , politicians on the left .
yet , by den@@ ying the obvious fact that the euro@@ zone ’ s vi@@ ability depends on substantial restra@@ ints on sovereig@@ n@@ ty , europe ’ s leaders are mis@@ leading their voters , del@@ a@@ ying the europe@@ ani@@ zation of democratic politics , and raising the political and economic costs of the ultimate reck@@ oning .
the euro@@ zone asp@@ ires to full economic integration , which ent@@ a@@ ils the elimin@@ ation of trans@@ action costs that im@@ pe@@ de cross-@@ border commerce and finance .
obviously , it requires that governments ren@@ ounce direct restri@@ ctions on trade and capital flows .
but it also requires that they harmon@@ ize their domestic rules and regulations – such as produ@@ ct-@@ safety standards and bank regulations – with those of other member states in order to ensure they do not act as indi@@ rect trade barriers . and governments must for@@ swear changes in these policies , lest the uncertainty itself act as a trans@@ action cost .
this was all implic@@ it in the european union ’ s single-@@ market initiative .
the euro@@ zone went one step further , a@@ iming through mon@@ etary uni@@ fication to eradicate fully the trans@@ action costs associated with national curren@@ cies and ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate risk .
simply put , the european integration project has hin@@ ged on restri@@ ctions on national sovereig@@ n@@ ty .
if its future is now in doubt , it is because sovereig@@ n@@ ty stands in the way once again .
in a true economic union , under@@ pinn@@ ed by uni@@ on-@@ wide political institutions , the financial problems of greece , spain , and the others would not have blown up to their current propor@@ tions , threatening the existence of the union itself .
consider the united states .
no one even keeps track of , say , florida ’ s curr@@ ent-@@ account deficit with the rest of the country , although we can safely guess that it is huge ( since the state is home to many reti@@ re@@ es living off benefits that come from elsewhere ) .
when florida ’ s state government goes bank@@ rupt , florida ’ s banks continue to operate normally , because they are under federal rather than state jur@@ is@@ di@@ ction .
when florida ’ s banks go bell@@ y-@@ up , state finan@@ ces are insul@@ ated , because the banks are ultimately the responsibility of federal institutions .
when florida ’ s workers become unemployed , they get unemployment checks from washington , dc .
and when florida ’ s voters are dis@@ en@@ chan@@ ted about the economy , they do not ri@@ ot outside the state capital ; they put pressure on their representatives in congress to push for changes in federal policies .
nobody would argue that us states have an abundance of sovereig@@ n@@ ty .
the relationship between sovereig@@ n@@ ty and democracy is also mis@@ understood .
not all restri@@ ctions on the exercise of sovereig@@ n power are un@@ democratic .
political scientists talk about “ democratic dele@@ gation ” – the idea that a sovereig@@ n might want to tie its hands ( through international commit@@ ments or dele@@ gation to autonomous agencies ) in order to achieve better outcomes .
the dele@@ gation of mon@@ etary policy to an independent central bank is the archet@@ ypal example : in the service of price stability , daily management of mon@@ etary policy is insul@@ ated from politics .
even if selective limitations on sovereig@@ n@@ ty may enhance democratic performance , there is no guarantee that all limitations impli@@ ed by market integration would do so .
in domestic politics , dele@@ gation is carefully cali@@ br@@ ated and restricted to a few areas where the issues tend to be highly technical and partisan differences are not large .
a truly democra@@ cy@@ -@@ enhan@@ cing globalization would respect these boundaries .
it would impose only those limits that are consistent with democratic dele@@ gation , possibly along with a limited number of proce@@ du@@ ral norms ( such as transparency , accountability , represent@@ a@@ tiveness , use of scientific evidence , etc . ) that enhance democratic deliber@@ ation at home .
as the american example illustrates , it is possible to give up on sovereig@@ n@@ ty – as florida , texas , california , and the other us states have done – without giving up on democracy .
but combining market integration with democracy requires the creation of supr@@ an@@ ational political institutions that are representative and accountable .
the conflict between democracy and globalization becomes acute when globalization restri@@ cts the domestic artic@@ u@@ lation of policy preferences without a comp@@ ens@@ ating expansion of democratic space at the regional / global level .
europe is already on the wrong side of this boundary , as the political un@@ rest in spain and greece indicates .
that is where my political tri@@ lem@@ ma begins to bite : we cannot have globalization , democracy , and national sovereig@@ n@@ ty simultaneously .
we must choose two among the three .
if european leaders want to maintain democracy , they must make a choice between political union and economic dis@@ integration .
they must either explicitly ren@@ ounce economic sovereig@@ n@@ ty or actively put it to use for the benefit of their citizens .
the first would ent@@ a@@ il coming clean with their own elec@@ tor@@ ates and building democratic space above the level of the nation-@@ state .
the second would mean giving up on mon@@ etary union in order to be able to deploy national mon@@ etary and fiscal policies in the service of lon@@ ger-@@ term recovery .
the longer this choice is post@@ po@@ ned , the greater the economic and political cost that ultimately will have to be paid .
economic policy ’ s narrative imperative
the crisis faced by the european union and the euro@@ zone is a telling example of the need for a narrative that explains public policy and generates political support for it .
a successful narrative can be neither too complicated nor simplistic .
it must capture the imagination , address the public ’ s anx@@ ie@@ ties , and generate realistic hope .
european central bank president mari@@ o dra@@ gh@@ i provided such a narrative to the financial markets last july .
he said that the ec@@ b would do everything necessary to prevent the dis@@ integration of the euro , adding simply : “ believe me , it will be enough . ”
with that sentence , dra@@ gh@@ i eliminated the perceived re-@@ den@@ om@@ ination tail risk that was highest in the case of greece , but that was driving up borrowing costs in spain , italy , and portugal as well .
it was not a popu@@ list message , because the ec@@ b does indeed have the fire@@ power to buy enough sovereig@@ n bonds on the secondary market to put a ceiling on interest rates , at least for many months .
central bankers , more generally , are typically able to provide short@@ - or medi@@ um-@@ term narratives to financial markets .
us federal reserve board chair@@ man ben ber@@ nan@@ ke provided his own by ple@@ d@@ ging that us short-term interest rates would remain very low , and the bank of japan ’ s new chair@@ man , har@@ u@@ hi@@ ko ku@@ ro@@ da , has just provided another by saying that he will double the money supply so that inflation reaches 2 % .
while central bankers can provide such narratives to financial markets , it is political leaders who must provide the overall soci@@ o@@ economic messages that encourage long-term real investment , elec@@ toral support for reform , and hope for the future .
central bank al@@ che@@ my , to borrow a term from the us journalist neil ir@@ win ’ s new book , has its limits .
europe , in particular , needs a narrative of long-term hope that will trigger a real recovery .
france is coming closer to the danger zone , and even germany ’ s annual gdp growth is falling well below 1 % per year .
in the meantime , the e@@ asing of sovereig@@ n interest@@ -@@ rate spreads provides little comfort to the growing army of unemployed in southern europe , where youth unemployment has reached dramatic heights – close to 60 % in greece and spain , and almost 40 % in italy .
the narrative should address three essential questions .
how can the european model of strong social solidar@@ ity and security be re@@ formed , but end@@ ure ?
how can economic growth be revi@@ ved and sustained throughout the eu ?
and how can europe ’ s institutions function with enhanced legiti@@ macy to accommo@@ date countries that share the euro and others that retain their national curren@@ cies ?
for star@@ ters , a revolution is required in the organization of work , learning , and leisure .
social solidar@@ ity , essential to european identity , can and must include longer work lives , but also more wor@@ k-@@ sharing , adult learning , and shorter average work weeks ( particularly close to retirement ) .
such flexibility requires the consent of all : employees must adjust to changing requirements ; emplo@@ yers must re-@@ organize their enter@@ pris@@ es to allow more wor@@ k-@@ sharing , work from home , and learning inter@@ vals ; and governments must over@@ haul taxes , income support , and regulation to promote a “ fle@@ x-@@ solidar@@ ity revolution ” that encoura@@ ges personal choice and responsibility , while remaining committed to social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on .
this can lead to a better future for all , with citizens gaining better access to adult education , having more free time to pursue personal interests , and remaining productive and occupa@@ tionally engaged far longer into their healthy lives .
europe does not need asia ’ s rates of economic growth .
it can secure decent jobs and prosperity , with a sustained annual growth rate of around 2 % .
to achieve that , german voters should be told not that their country ’ s resources will forever flow to spain , but that their wages can rise at twice the rate of the recent past without ris@@ king inflation or a curr@@ ent-@@ account deficit , because germany has the world ’ s largest external surplus .
servi@@ ce-@@ sector industries throughout the eu must be opened up .
the countries with stronger fiscal positions should take the lead in a major pan@@ -@@ european sk@@ ill-@@ up@@ gra@@ ding program .
the number of pan@@ -@@ european scholar@@ ships should be doubled .
school programs everywhere should aim to educate tri@@ ling@@ ual citizens .
moreover , a full european banking union with shared resources for resolution should be created without further delay .
the european investment bank , which received a significant capital increase in 2012 , should add a large invest@@ ment-@@ support program for medi@@ um-@@ size enter@@ pris@@ es to its current operations , with a subsi@@ dy finan@@ ced from the european budget to encourage first-@@ time job ta@@ kers for a limited period .
jobs and training for young people must be the cen@@ ter@@ piece for the new growth p@@ act , and projects must move ahead in “ crisis mode , ” rather than according to business as usual .
finally , while mon@@ etary union obviously requires greater sharing of sovereig@@ n@@ ty , there should also be a “ greater europe ” that includes the united kingdom and others .
this impli@@ es two-@@ tier institutions that can accommo@@ date both types of countries : the “ euro@@ -@@ ins ” and those that prefer to preserve their mon@@ etary sovereig@@ n@@ ty in a larger europe built around a vibrant single market and common democratic values .
these interconnected visions can and must be realized if europe is to thrive again .
together , they form a compelling narrative that european leaders must begin to articulate .
brus@@ sels – at high-@@ level gather@@ ings of the european union elite , one often hears the following type of statement : “ europe must integrate and centr@@ alize economic governance in order to defend its social model in an age of globalization . ”
european commission president jo@@ s@@ é manuel bar@@ ro@@ so and his counter@@ part at the european council , her@@ man van ro@@ m@@ pu@@ y , are particularly keen on this argument .
but the claim that only deeper eu integration can save the “ european ” social model from the ons@@ lau@@ ght of emerging markets is not true .
yes , globalization represents a challenge to all eu member states ; but it is not clear how more integration would help them to confront it .
more european economic governance is not a pan@@ ac@@ e@@ a .
in fact , it is not even clear which european social model needs to be saved .
the common elements that are usually identified with the “ european ” social model are a quest for equality and a strong welfare state .
but neither of the main problems confron@@ ting europe ’ s soci@@ al-@@ security systems – slow economic growth and aging populations ( a function of low fertility ) – can be addressed at the european level .
this is obvious for fertility , which is determined by deeper social and demographic trends that cannot really be influenced by government action .
and , while aging could be transformed into an opportunity if the elderly could be made more productive , this requires action at the national and societal levels , not more european integration .
it is understandable that european leaders talk so much about globalization , given that the european economy is rather open for its size , with exports amo@@ unting to about 20 % of gdp , compared to just 12 % in the us .
the ( re@@ - ) emergence of big economies like china is thus bound to have a greater impact on europe than on the us .
economists long ago recognized that it is theoretically possible that the emergence of new growth poles abroad does more harm than good to an economy .
this can happen if the new economic powers are more important as competitors than they are as customers .
but this does not seem to be the case , even with respect to china .
the eu does have a bil@@ ateral trade deficit with china , but it also exports a lot to the chinese market – much more than the us does .
more important , even if one accep@@ ts the view that globalization constit@@ utes a threat to europe ’ s social model , there is little scope for further integration , given that trade policy is already fully unified at the eu level .
in any case , the eu has generally contributed construc@@ tively to all major ro@@ unds of global trade liber@@ alization .
with the eu helping to keep global markets open , european exports have held up rather well , with the eu maintaining its market share .
although it has lost ground relative to the emerging markets ( especially china ) , it has far out@@ performed other developed economies like the us and japan .
this is true even in services , despite slow productivity growth in europe .
it is thus wrong to assume that economies based on cheap labor are massively out@@ competing the eu .
moreover , this relatively good trade performance has been achieved with a much lower increase in wage inequality in europe than in the us .
the various european social models have thus been , on average , quite robust – most likely because of the absence of a master plan from brus@@ sels on how to respond to globalization . each member country has had to adapt in its own way , knowing that it could not bend the rules of the game in its own favor .
not all succeeded ; but the successes ( germany , for example ) far out@@ weigh the failures ( see greece ) .
the key to en@@ suring the future of europe ’ s soci@@ al-@@ security systems , and thus its social model , is faster growth .
and , again , it is difficult to see how more europe would improve the situation .
the obstacles to growth are well known , and have existed for a long time without being removed .
the reason is quite simple : if there were a politically easy way to generate growth , it would have been implemented already .
moreover , most national policymakers have a tendency to blame “ brus@@ sels ” for all of their difficult choices , thus creating the impression at home that the economy would improve if economic affairs could be managed without eu interference .
more integration is pre@@ ached at the european level , but implic@@ itly portra@@ yed at home as an obstacle to growth .
this double-@@ speak on the part of national political elites is perceived as such by voters , whose trust in both national and eu institutions is naturally declining .
the claim that europe needs more integration to save its social model has long lost credi@@ bility .
integration is irrelevant to that question , and , in those areas where deeper integration really would benefit europe , it appears to be the last thing that national leaders want .
why euro@@ bonds are un-@@ american
brus@@ sels – the emerging consensus in europe nowadays is that only “ debt mu@@ tu@@ alization ” in the form of euro@@ bonds can resolve the euro crisis , with advoc@@ ates frequently c@@ iting the early united states , when alexander ham@@ il@@ ton , president george washington ’ s treas@@ ury secretary , successfully pres@@ sed the new federal government to assume the revolutionary war deb@@ ts of america ’ s states .
but a closer look reveals that this early us experience provides neither a useful analogy nor an encouraging prece@@ dent for euro@@ bonds .
first , taking over a stock of existing state debt at the federal level is very different from allowing individual member states to issue bonds with “ joint and several ” li@@ ability under@@ written by all member states collectively .
ham@@ il@@ ton did not have to worry about moral hazard , because the federal government did not guarantee any new debt in@@ cur@@ red by the states .
second , it is sel@@ dom mentioned that us federal debt at the time ( around $ 40 million ) was much larger than that of the states ( about $ 18 million ) .
thus , assuming state debt was not central to the success of post-@@ war financial stabili@@ zation in the new country ; rather , it was a natural cor@@ oll@@ ary of the fact that most of the debt had been in@@ cur@@ red fighting for a common cause .
moreover , the most efficient sources of government revenues at the time were tari@@ ffs and taxes collected at the external border .
even from an efficiency point of view , it made sense to have the federal government service public debt .
federal assumption of the states ’ war deb@@ ts also yiel@@ ded an advantage in terms of economic development : once states no longer had any debt , they had no need to raise any revenues through direct tax@@ ation , which might have im@@ pe@@ ded the growth of america ’ s internal market .
indeed , after the federal government assumed the states ’ debt ( already a small part of the total ) , state revenues fell by 80-@@ 90 % .
the states then became for some time fis@@ cally irrelevant .
finally , the key to the success of financial stabili@@ zation was a profound re@@ struc@@ turing .
ham@@ il@@ ton estimated that the federal government could raise enough revenues to pay approximately 4 % interest on the total amount of debt to be servi@@ ced – significantly less than the 6 % yield on the existing obli@@ ga@@ tions .
holders of both state and federal bonds were thus offered a basket of long-@@ dated bonds , some with an interest rate of 3 % , and others with 6 % ( with a ten-@@ year grace period ) .
the basket was designed in such a way as to result in an average deb@@ t-@@ service cost of 4 % .
in modern terms , the “ net present value ” of the total debt ( federal and state ) was reduced by about one-@@ half if one were to apply the usual exit yield of 9 % .
moreover , the new federal bonds ’ very long ma@@ turi@@ ties meant that there was no ro@@ l@@ lover risk .
it would have been very dangerous to expose the federal government to this danger , given that the operation was rightly perceived at the out@@ set as extremely risky .
for the country ’ s first few years , debt service swallowed more than 80 % of all federal revenues .
the sli@@ ghtest negative shock could have bank@@ rup@@ ted the new federal government .
fortunately , the opposite happened : federal revenues tri@@ pled under the impact of a rapid post-@@ war reconstruction boom , and continued to grow rapidly , ai@@ ded by the country ’ s ability to remain neutral while wars ra@@ va@@ ged the european continent .
by contrast , growth pro@@ spe@@ cts in europe today are rather di@@ m , and interest payments , even for greece or italy , account for less than 20 % of total revenues .
the real problem is the ro@@ l@@ lover of existing debt in a stag@@ nat@@ ing economy .
for example , italy will soon have a balanced budget in structural terms , but must still face the problem of re@@ finan@@ cing old debt as it ma@@ tures each year .
assu@@ aging doubt about the sustainability of public debt in the euro@@ zone would thus probably require a deep re@@ struc@@ turing as well .
the euro@@ zone crisis could certainly be resolved if all existing public debt were transformed into 20-@@ year euro@@ bonds with a yield of 3 % , and a five-@@ year grace period on debt service .
one can easily anticipate the impact that this would have on financial markets .
more interesting in view of the current situation in the euro@@ zone is what followed roughly a half-@@ century after ham@@ il@@ ton acted .
in the 18@@ 30 ’ s and 18@@ 40 ’ s , a number of states had over-@@ invested in the leading transport technology of the time – can@@ als .
when the can@@ al-@@ building boom ended , eight states and the territory of florida ( accounting for about 10 % of the entire us population at the time ) were unable to service their debt and de@@ faul@@ ted on their , mostly british , loans .
british bankers threatened that they would never again invest in these un@@ trust@@ worthy americans .
they could point to the prece@@ dent set by ham@@ il@@ ton , and had probably invested on the implic@@ it understanding that , if necessary , the federal government would ba@@ il out the states again .
but , despite foreign credi@@ tors ’ threats , the federal government did not come to the rescue .
the bail@@ out request did not succeed because it could not muster a simple majority of the states ( represented by the senate ) and the population ( represented by the house of representatives ) under the normal decision-making procedure ( the “ community method , ” in european union jargon ) .
the de@@ faul@@ ts proved to be costly .
the 18@@ 40 ’ s were a period of slow growth , and continued pressure from foreign credi@@ tors forced most of the official deb@@ tors to res@@ u@@ me payments after a while .
default was not an easy way out , and all us states ( with the exception of ver@@ mon@@ t ) have since embraced bal@@ ance@@ d-@@ budget am@@ end@@ ments to their constitu@@ tions as a way to shore up their fiscal credi@@ bility .
are eu members prepared to take a similar step ?
the world bank , the open society institute , and the european commission are co-@@ sponsor@@ ing a conference , ro@@ ma in an expanding europe : challenges for the future , from june 30-@@ july 1 in budapest , with the government of hung@@ ary as host .
here , the president of the world bank and the chair@@ man of the o@@ si discuss the problems that must be addressed .
too often in the countries of central and eastern europe , ro@@ ma teens and children spend their days at the garbage dump .
unable to afford school , they sc@@ aven@@ ge for paper and other scra@@ ps for recycling , earning just enough to eat .
too often ro@@ ma families live in tiny cra@@ mp@@ ed wooden or tin sha@@ cks with no power or running water and di@@ m pro@@ spe@@ cts for the future .
a similar picture , though on a smaller scale , exists in many european union member countries that are home to ro@@ ma min@@ orities .
a wide soci@@ o@@ economic dispar@@ ity exists between europe &apos;s majority population and ro@@ ma , or &quot; gyp@@ sies &quot; , many of whom live in extreme poverty .
left un@@ changed , this persistent poverty threat@@ ens to become a permanent drag on european prosperity , which would be a tragedy for ro@@ ma and non-@@ ro@@ ma alike .
the situation of the 7-@@ 9 million ro@@ ma living on the continent deserves the urgent attention of government leaders as they shape the policies of an en@@ lar@@ ged eu .
ro@@ ma are the continent &apos;s fastest growing and most vulnerable minority .
boo@@ sting their pro@@ spe@@ cts will be crucial to sustained prosperity on the continent , and will require imple@@ menting inclusive policies to ensure that ro@@ ma enjoy the post-@@ transition benefits of open , free-@@ market economies .
indeed , ro@@ ma have been among the biggest los@@ ers in the transition from communism since 1989 .
they were often the first to lose their jobs in the early 1990 &apos;s , and they have been persi@@ stently blocked from re@@ entering the labor force due to their often inadequate skills and pervasive discrimin@@ ation .
even in the more prosper@@ ous countries of central and eastern europe , ro@@ ma poverty is stri@@ k@@ ingly high-@@ -@@ sometimes more than ten times that of non-@@ ro@@ ma .
while acc@@ ession countries such as hung@@ ary , the c@@ ze@@ ch republic , and slo@@ v@@ ak@@ ia have made impressive progress in economic and political transformation during the 1990 &apos;s , dealing with the p@@ light of the ro@@ ma remains one of the most critical issues on their path to eu mem@@ ber@@ ship next year and over the next decade .
in 2000 , nearly 80 % of ro@@ ma in bulg@@ aria and roman@@ ia were living on less than $ 4.@@ 30 per day , in comparison with 37 % of the total population of bulg@@ aria and 30 % in roman@@ ia .
in bet@@ ter-@@ off hung@@ ary , 40 % of ro@@ ma were living on incomes below this level , compared with 7 % of the non-@@ ro@@ ma population .
poverty , combined with higher birth rates , means that the magnitude of ro@@ ma hard@@ ship will grow in coming years .
roughly 25-@@ 30 % of ro@@ ma are under 15 years of age , in contrast with 10 % of the majority population .
high unemployment , particularly among young people , locks ro@@ ma in a vicious cycle of im@@ pover@@ ishment and exclu@@ sion , further driving down living standards and leaving many in margin@@ alized sett@@ lements without access to electricity , clean water , or other basic utili@@ ties .
lack of education keeps ro@@ ma out of work and limits their future opportunities .
an estimated 60@@ 0,000 ro@@ ma children of primary school age living in the eu acc@@ ession countries are not atten@@ ding school at all .
of those that go , most do not complete primary school , and less than 1 % across central and eastern europe go on to higher education .
many students who are in class are stuck in inferior se@@ gre@@ gated schools .
others are wrong@@ ly placed in schools for the mentally and physically disabled , merely because they had no access to pres@@ cho@@ ol , or because they do not speak the majority language .
nonetheless , there is reason for optimism .
over the past decade , a range of initi@@ atives have been launched to keep ro@@ ma children in school , expand access to jobs , and overcome discrimin@@ ation .
while such interventions by governments , non-@@ government groups and international agencies have helped , the time has now come to scale up the effort .
most importantly , a small but growing core of experienced and dedicated young ro@@ ma leaders is emerging who can work both within their communities and with governments to overcome poverty and discrimin@@ ation .
at the end of this month , many of these young people will join us in budapest , along with prime ministers and other senior officials from central and eastern european countries and eu member states .
for the first time , government and ro@@ ma leaders will tackle the ro@@ ma issue as a core social and economic concern .
such an integrated policy approach is needed to ensure that the basic rights of ro@@ ma are truly realized in an expanded europe .
we cannot afford to leave the ro@@ ma behind .
why fair trade ?
london – historically , the term “ fair trade ” has meant many things .
the fair trade league was founded in britain in 18@@ 81 to restri@@ ct impor@@ ts from foreign countries .
in the united states , businesses and labor uni@@ ons use “ fair trade ” laws to construct what economist joseph stig@@ li@@ tz calls “ bar@@ be@@ d-@@ wire barriers to impor@@ ts . ”
these so called “ anti-@@ dumping ” laws allow a company that suspe@@ cts a foreign ri@@ val of selling a product below cost to request that the government impose special tari@@ ffs to protect it from “ unfair ” competition .
such dark prote@@ c@@ tionist thoughts are far from the minds of the ben@@ evol@@ ent organi@@ zers of the united kingdom ’ s annual “ fair@@ trade fort@@ night , ” during which i just bought two bars of fair@@ -@@ trade chocolate and a jar of fair@@ -@@ trade chun@@ ky pean@@ ut butter .
their worthy aim is to raise the price paid to develop@@ ing-@@ country farmers for their produce by exclu@@ ding the in@@ fl@@ ated profits of the midd@@ le@@ men on whom they depend for getting their goods to distant markets .
fair@@ -@@ trade products like co@@ co@@ a , coffee , tea , and bananas do not compete with domestic european production , and therefore do not have a prote@@ c@@ tionist motive .
this is how it works : in exchange for being paid a guaranteed price and meeting “ agreed labor and environmental standards ” ( minimum wages , no pesticides ) , poor@@ -@@ country farming co@@ opera@@ tives receive a fair@@ trade mark for their products , issued by the fair@@ trade lab@@ eling organization .
this certi@@ fication enables supermarkets and other re@@ tail@@ ers to sell the products at a premi@@ um .
third-@@ world farmers get a boost to their income , while first-@@ world consumers get to feel virtu@@ ous : a marriage made in heaven .
the fair@@ -@@ trade movement , launched in the 1980 ’ s , has been growing rapidly .
in a not@@ able breakthrough in 1997 , the british house of commons decided to serve only fair@@ -@@ trade coffee .
by the end of 2007 , more than 600 producers ’ organizations , representing 1.@@ 4 million farmers in 58 countries , were selling fair@@ -@@ trade products .
today , a quarter of all bananas in uk supermarkets are sold under a fair@@ trade mark .
but fair@@ trade-@@ labeled products still represent a very small share – typically less than 1 % – of global sales of co@@ co@@ a , tea , coffee , etc .
the economic rationale for guaranteed prices is well known : stabili@@ zing the prices of primary products , which are subject to sharp fluctuations , stabili@@ zes their producers ’ incomes .
this argument inspired pro@@ pos@@ als – most famously by john may@@ n@@ ard key@@ nes in 194@@ 2 – to create “ bu@@ ffer stocks ” for the main commodities , which would take supply off the market when prices fell , and add to supply when prices rose .
key@@ nes ’ s proposal never made it into the brett@@ on woods agreement of 194@@ 4 , and , while buff@@ er-@@ stock sch@@ emes re-@@ sur@@ faced in the 1970 ’ s , they , too , went nowhere .
left-@@ wing economists like ra@@ ú@@ l pre@@ bisch , moreover , later advanced the theory of “ declining terms of trade ” for primary products : their prices ’ long-@@ run tendency to fall relative to the prices of manufactured goods .
this tendency seemed to be at work from the mid-@@ 1980 ’ s , as commodity producers experienced a persistent decline in prices .
in addition , price fluctuations throughout that decade were huge , with di@@ re effects on sub-saharan african and other developing countries that were largely dependent on commodities for export ear@@ nings .
since then , however , the price decline has been rever@@ sed .
food commodity prices have increased by 150 % since 2001 .
this has raised farm producers ’ income independently of the fair@@ -@@ trade movement ’ s efforts .
the “ declining terms of trade ” argument has collapsed .
but primar@@ y-@@ product prices remain much more vola@@ tile than the prices of manufactured goods and services , causing large fluctuations in producers ’ incomes .
this exagger@@ ates the effects of booms and bu@@ sts .
so the issue of price stabili@@ zation has not gone away .
it is difficult to see how the fair@@ -@@ trade movement can contribute much to solving this problem , because the only serious policy for stabili@@ zing producers ’ incomes is to control supply .
but that is beyond the scope of fair trade .
the target of all versions of fair trade is “ free trade , ” and the most dama@@ ging attacks on fair@@ trade have come from free tra@@ ders .
in unfair trade , a pam@@ ph@@ let published in 2008 by the adam smith institute , mark si@@ dwell argues that fair@@ trade keeps un@@ competitive farmers on the land , holding back diversi@@ fication and mechan@@ ization .
according to si@@ dwell , the fair@@ trade scheme turns developing countries into low-@@ profit , labor@@ -@@ intensive agr@@ arian ghet@@ tos , den@@ ying future generations the chance of a better life .
this is without considering the effect that fair@@ trade has on the poorest people in these countries – not farmers but casual labor@@ ers – who are exclu@@ ded from the scheme by its expensive regulations and labor standards .
in other words , fair@@ trade protects farmers against their ri@@ vals and against agricultural labor@@ ers .
consumers , si@@ dwell argues , are also being du@@ ped .
only a tiny proportion – as little as 1 % – of the premi@@ um that we pay for a fair@@ trade chocolate bar will ever make it to co@@ co@@ a producers .
nor is fair@@ trade necessarily a guarantee of quality : because producers get a minimum price for fair@@ -@@ trade goods , they sell the best of their crop on the open market .
but , despite its sha@@ ky economics , the fair@@ -@@ trade movement should not be des@@ pis@@ ed .
while cy@@ ni@@ cs say that its only achievement is to make consumers feel better about their purch@@ ases – rather like buying indul@@ gen@@ ces in the old catholic church – this is to sell fair trade short .
in fact , the movement represents a spark of protest against mind@@ less consu@@ mer@@ ism , gras@@ s-@@ roots resistance against an im@@ personal logic , and an expression of communal ac@@ tivism .
that justi@@ fication will not convince economists , who prefer a dr@@ yer sort of reasoning .
but it is not out of place to remind ourselves that economists and bureau@@ crats need not always have things their own way .
why finance can save the planet
paris – most people hate finance , viewing it as the epit@@ ome of ir@@ responsibility and gre@@ ed .
but , even after causing a on@@ ce-@@ in-@@ a-@@ century recession and unemployment for millions , finance looks in@@ dispen@@ s@@ able for preventing an even worse catastrophe : climate change .
action is ur@@ gently needed to contain global warming and prevent a disaster for humanity ; yet the global community is desperately short of tools .
there is not much support for the most des@@ ir@@ able solutions advoc@@ ated by economists , such as a global cap on green@@ house@@ -@@ gas emissions , coupled with a trading system , or the en@@ for@@ cement of a worldwide carbon price through a global tax on co2 emissions .
instead , negotiations for the united nations climate change conference in paris in december are being conducted on the basis of voluntary , un@@ il@@ ateral ple@@ dges called intended nation@@ ally determined contributions .
although the inclu@@ sion of voluntary targets has the mer@@ it of creating global momentum , this approach is unlikely to result in commit@@ ments that are both bin@@ ding and commen@@ su@@ rate to the challenge .
that is why climate advoc@@ ates are increasingly looking for other means of trig@@ gering action .
finance is at the top of their list .
for star@@ ters , finance provides an accurate y@@ ar@@ d@@ stick to g@@ auge if dee@@ ds are consistent with words .
in 2011 , “ un@@ burn@@ able carbon , ” a path@@ -@@ breaking report by the non@@ governmental carbon tra@@ cker initiative , showed that the proven fos@@ sil@@ -@@ fuel reserves owned by governments and private companies exce@@ ed by a factor of five the quantity of carbon that can be burned in the next 50 years if global warming is to be kept below two degrees celsius .
reserves held just by the 200 top publicly listed fuel companies – thus exclu@@ ding state-@@ owned producers such as saudi arabia ’ s ar@@ am@@ co – exce@@ ed this carbon budget by one-third .
and that means that these companies ’ stock@@ -@@ market valu@@ ation is in@@ consistent with containing global warning .
this realization promp@@ ted a campaign to convince investors to di@@ v@@ est from carbon-@@ rich assets .
individuals and institutions representing a $ 2.@@ 6 trillion portfolio have already joined the di@@ vest@@ ment movement .
furthermore , bank of england governor mark car@@ ney has high@@ ligh@@ ted the threat represented by potentially strand@@ ed carbon assets .
investors are being war@@ ned that , from the standpoint of financial stability , “ brown ” se@@ curi@@ ties bear specific risk .
the amount of di@@ vest@@ ment may look big – and it is , particularly given that the campaign started recently .
yet $ 2.@@ 6 trillion amounts to less than 5 % of global private non-@@ financial se@@ curi@@ ties .
the trend is real , but it is still too little to trigger significant changes in fos@@ sil@@ -@@ fuel companies ’ valu@@ ation and behavior .
a second reason why finance matters is that the transition to a low-@@ carbon economy requires huge investments .
according to the international energy agency , global investment in energy supply currently amounts to $ 1.@@ 6 trillion annu@@ ally , and 70 % of it is still based on oil , coal , or gas .
green investment amounts to only 15 % of the total , and investment in energy efficiency – in buildings , transport , and industry – tot@@ als a me@@ ager $ 130 billion .
containing the increase in average surface temperature to two degrees requires developing clean technologies , and even more important , a four-@@ fold increase in investment in energy efficiency over the next ten years .
yet such investment will not be finan@@ ced easily : its return depends on a still@@ -@@ elu@@ sive carbon price and will often materi@@ alize only in the long run , while improving energy efficiency impli@@ es replacing hundreds of millions of out@@ dated vehicles and re@@ fitting hundreds of millions of energy-@@ vor@@ acious buildings .
adequate finan@@ cing instruments are required for the right purpose at the right place and at the right scale .
development banks and green banks have a huge role to play .
for example , dedicated long-term loans , coupled with a tax break or a subsi@@ dy , would help households decide to moderni@@ ze their homes .
but the real hope among climate specialists is that innovative finance could help provide the planning clarity that is currently missing .
to e@@ lic@@ it the investments that are necessary to mi@@ ti@@ gate climate change and green the economy , the elimin@@ ation of fos@@ sil@@ -@@ fuel subsidies and a credible , fast-@@ rising path for the price of carbon are vital .
but , because high fuel prices are un@@ popular with consumers and raise competi@@ tiveness concerns among businesses , governments are reluctant to take action today – and may rene@@ ge on their commit@@ ments to act tomorrow .
to overcome such tre@@ pi@@ dation , advoc@@ ates for climate action are turning to incentives .
some have recommen@@ ded that governments issue co2 performance bonds , whose yield would be reduced if companies exce@@ ed their carbon target .
another idea , put forward in a recent paper by michel ag@@ li@@ et@@ ta and his colleagues , is to map out a path for an indi@@ cative price of carbon called its “ social value ” and provide green project developers a govern@@ ment-@@ guaranteed carbon certificate representing the value of the corresponding emissions reduction .
central banks , they suggest , would then re@@ finance loans to such developers , up to the value of the carbon certificate .
this would amount to a calculated bet .
if the price of carbon in , say , ten years , actually corresponds to the announced social value , the project will be profitable and the developer will re@@ pay the loan .
but if the government rene@@ ges on its commitment , the developer will default , leaving the central bank with a claim on the government .
failure to increase the price of carbon would result either in higher public debt or , in the case of mon@@ eti@@ zation , inflation .
the idea is to force governments to have skin in the game , by balancing the risk of in@@ action on the carbon tax with the risk of in@@ sol@@ ven@@ cy or inflation .
there would be no pro@@ cra@@ st@@ ination .
action against global warming would take place without delay .
but a decade or so later , governments – and societies more broadly – would need to choose between tax@@ ation , debt , and inflation .
under@@ taking massive investment now and deciding only later how to finance it looks ir@@ responsible – and so it is .
but not acting at all would be even more ir@@ responsible .
why financial pay shouldn ’ t be left to the market
cambridge – although some financial firms are re@@ forming how they pay their employees , governments around the world are seriously considering regul@@ ating such firms ’ compen@@ sation structures .
the bas@@ el committee on banking super@@ vision has recently come out in favor of such regulations , and the united states house of representatives has voted to require regul@@ ators to set compen@@ sation rules .
perhaps not surprisingly , many financial bos@@ ses are up in arms over such moves .
they claim that they need the freedom to set compen@@ sation pack@@ ages in order to keep their most talented people – the ones who will revi@@ ve the world ’ s financial system .
so , should governments step back and let financial firms reform themselves ?
the answer is clearly no .
in the post-@@ crisis financial order , governments must take on the role of monitoring and regul@@ ating pay in financial firms ; otherwise , the per@@ verse incentives that contributed to the current crisis could easily re@@ cu@@ r .
it is important to distinguish between two sources of concern about pay in financial firms .
one set of concerns arises from the perspective of share@@ holders .
figures recently released by new york ’ s at@@ tor@@ ney general , andrew cu@@ om@@ o , indicate that nine large financial firms paid their employees aggregate compen@@ sation exce@@ eding $ 600 billion in 200@@ 3-@@ 2008 – a period in which their aggregate market capit@@ alization substan@@ tially declined .
such patterns may raise concerns among share@@ holders that pay structures are not well designed to serve their interests .
even if financial firms have governance problems that produce pay decisions devi@@ ating from share@@ holder interests , however , such problems do not necessarily war@@ rant government regulation of those decisions .
such problems are best addressed by rules that focus on improving internal governance processes and streng@@ th@@ ening investors ’ rights , leaving the choices that determine compen@@ sation structures to corporate boards and the share@@ holders who ele@@ ct them .
but pay in financial firms also raises a second important source of concern : even if compen@@ sation structures are designed in the interests of share@@ holders , they may produce incentives for exc@@ essive ris@@ k-@@ taking that are socially un@@ des@@ ir@@ able .
as a result , even if corporate governance problems in financial firms are fully addressed , a government role in regul@@ ating their compen@@ sation structures may still be war@@ ran@@ ted .
suppose that most financial firms could be reli@@ ed upon by regul@@ ators to be run in the interest of their share@@ holders .
would this justify ex@@ emp@@ ting these firms from existing regulations that constra@@ in their decisions with respect to len@@ ding , investment , or capital reserves ?
clearly not , because share@@ holders do not bear the full costs of a firm ’ s collapse , and , as the recent crisis demonstrates , the bill for such a down@@ fall must be picked up , at least in part , by taxpa@@ yers and the economy .
so share@@ holders ’ interests might sometimes be served by business decisions that are too “ risky , ” and regul@@ ating such decisions is justi@@ fied – indeed , necessary .
regulation of pay in financial firms is called for by the same reasons that justify the traditional regulations of the firms ’ business decisions .
the incentives generated by compen@@ sation structures determine how firms ’ managers behave within the boundaries per@@ mitted by such traditional , direct regulations .
and as traditional regulation of business decisions is bound to be im@@ perfect , regul@@ ating compen@@ sation structures can be a useful additional tool to control the risks posed by financial firms ’ behavior .
if choices of compen@@ sation structures can be expected to affect financial firms ’ stability , regul@@ ating these choices can also be useful for protecting this stability .
financial firms opposed to pay regulation will likely warn against “ micro-@@ managing ” compen@@ sation , and argue that compen@@ sation choices must take into account information about each individual manager that regul@@ ators are almost certain to lack .
but pay regulation can improve matters without micro-@@ management by setting general standards from which firms may not devi@@ ate but that still leave them with significant freedom to account for the individual circumstances of managers .
for example , regul@@ atory standards could require equ@@ ity-@@ based plans to pre@@ clu@@ de managers from c@@ ash@@ ing out awar@@ ded shares and options during a certain minimum period after vest@@ ing .
in such a case , firms could still remain free to choose the number of shares and options awar@@ ded to any given manager , as well as to adjust somewhat the length of the post-@@ vest@@ ing period during which c@@ ash@@ ing out would be pre@@ clu@@ ded .
finally , those op@@ posing pay regulation are certain to warn us about “ unintended consequences . ”
but this warning should not carry the day .
we have experienced over the last several years the real and costly consequences of a compen@@ sation regime that left financial firms free to set their own pay structures .
are we to believe that those consequences are prefer@@ able to the unintended consequences of pay regulation ?
the effort to avoid the harm of fla@@ wed compen@@ sation decisions in the future should not be deter@@ red by specu@@ lative arguments about unintended consequences .
financial firms should not retain the freedom to create per@@ verse incentives that put all of us at risk .
banking reform ’ s fear factor
washington , dc – nearly five years after the worst financial crisis since the 19@@ 30 ’ s , and three years after the en@@ ac@@ tment of the dod@@ d-@@ frank financial reforms in the united states , one question is on everyone ’ s mind : why have we made so little progress ?
new rules have been promised , but very few have actually been implemented .
there is not yet a “ vol@@ cker rule ” ( limit@@ ing propri@@ etary trading by banks ) , the rules for deriva@@ tives are still a wor@@ k-@@ in-@@ progress , and mon@@ e@@ y-@@ market funds remain un@@ re@@ formed .
even worse , our biggest banks have become even larger .
there is no sign that they have abandoned the incentive structure that encoura@@ ges exc@@ essive ris@@ k-@@ taking .
and the great distor@@ tions from being “ too big to fail ” lo@@ om large over many economies .
there are three possible explanations for what has gone wrong . one is that financial reform is inherently complicated .
but , though many technical details need to be fl@@ es@@ hed out , some of the world ’ s smartest people work in the relevant regul@@ atory agencies .
they are more than capable of writing and en@@ forcing rules – that is , when this is what they are really asked to do .
the second explanation focuses on conflict among agencies with over@@ la@@ pping jur@@ is@@ dic@@ tions , both within and across countries .
again , there is an element of truth to this ; but we have also seen a great deal of coordination even on the most complex topics – such as how much equity big banks should have , or how the potential failure of such a firm should be hand@@ led .
that leaves the final explanation : those in charge of financial reform really did not want to make rapid progress .
in both the us and europe , government leaders are gri@@ pped by one over@@ riding fear : that their economies will slip back into recession – or worse .
the big banks play on this fear , arguing that financial reform will cause them to become un@@ profitable and make them unable to l@@ end , or that there will be some other di@@ re unintended consequence .
there has been a ver@@ itable a@@ val@@ an@@ che of lo@@ bb@@ ying on this point , which has resulted in top officials moving slowly , for fear of dama@@ ging the economy .
but this is a grave mistake – based on a failure to understand how big banks can damage the economy .
higher equ@@ ity-@@ capital requirements , for example , require banks to fund themselves with relatively more equity and relatively less debt .
this makes them safer , because they are more able to absorb losses , and less likely to become z@@ om@@ bie banks ( which do not make sensible loans ) .
the banks claim that higher capital requirements and other regulations will drive up the cost of credit .
but there is no sign of any such effect – a point made , rather bel@@ at@@ edly , in the federal reserve ’ s mon@@ etary policy report to the us congress last week .
on the contrary , the biggest us banks are reporting very healthy profits for the last quarter .
unfortunately , a big part of these banks ’ profits ste@@ ms from trading se@@ curi@@ ties – exactly the sort of high-@@ risk activity that got them into trouble in the run@@ -up to the 2008 global financial crisis .
these are highly lever@@ aged businesses , typically funding their balance sheets with no more than 5 % equity ( and thus 95 % debt ) .
to understand why this is a problem , consider what happens when you buy a house with just 5 % down ( or less than 3 % down , which is a better analogy for some european banks ) .
if house prices go up , you make a good return on your equity ( and a better return than if you had put 20 % down ) .
but if house prices go down , your equity may well be wiped out ( which is what it means to be underwater on your mortgage ) .
higher equ@@ ity-@@ capital requirements for banks are good for the broader economy – they make financial crises ( and the z@@ om@@ bie@@ -@@ syndrome ) less likely , less severe , or both .
us banks are currently funded with more equity than was the case before the financial crisis , and they are doing fine .
nonetheless , we should still worry about their ability to blow themselves up in a novel and creative fashion – hence the need for the vol@@ cker rule , deriva@@ tives reform , and new rules for mon@@ e@@ y-@@ market funds .
and equ@@ ity-@@ capital requirements for large , syste@@ mi@@ cally important financial institutions remain too low .
the latest indi@@ cations are that us policymakers are finally starting to focus on this point .
many european banks , however , have less equity than their us counter@@ parts , which creates an important source of vulnerability going forward .
if there is to be a broad@@ -based european recovery , the banks must raise more equity , thereby streng@@ th@@ ening their ability to absorb potential losses .
unfortunately , there is little sign that european policymakers understand this point .
instead , senior officials in europe think and talk like us policymakers did three years ago .
they are war@@ y of ro@@ cking the financial boat , so they go easy on financial reform and refuse to insist on more equity capital for banks .
this is a mistake that they – and possibly all of us – may come to regret .
models behaving badly
london – “ why did no one see the crisis coming ? ” queen elizabeth ii asked economists during a visit to the london school of economics at the end of 2008 .
four years later , the repeated failure of economic fore@@ ca@@ sters to predict the depth and duration of the sl@@ um@@ p would have e@@ lic@@ ited a similar question from the queen : why the over@@ estimate of recovery ?
in its 2011 forecast , the international mon@@ etary fund predicted that the european economy would grow by 2.@@ 1 % in 2012 .
in fact , it looks certain to shrink this year by 0.@@ 2 % .
in the united kingdom , the 2010 forecast of the office for budget responsibility ( ob@@ r ) projected 2.@@ 6 % growth in 2011 and 2.@@ 8 % growth in 2012 ; in fact , the uk economy grew by 0.@@ 9 % in 2011 and will flat@@ -@@ line in 2012 .
the oecd ’ s latest forecast for euro@@ zone gdp in 2012 is 2.@@ 3 % lower than its projection in 2010 .
likewise , the imf now predicts that the european economy will be 7.@@ 8 % smaller in 2015 than it thought just two years ago .
some fore@@ ca@@ sters are more pessimi@@ stic than others ( the ob@@ r has a particularly sunny dis@@ position ) , but no one , it seems , has been pessimi@@ stic enough .
economic fore@@ casting is necessarily im@@ precise : too many things happen for fore@@ ca@@ sters to be able to fores@@ ee all of them .
so judgment calls and best gu@@ esses are an inevitable part of “ scientific ” economic fore@@ ca@@ sts .
but im@@ precision is one thing ; the systematic over@@ estimate of the economic recovery in europe is quite another .
indeed , the figures have been repeatedly re@@ vised , even over quite short periods of time , casting strong doubt on the vali@@ dity of the economic models being used .
these models , and the institutions using them , rely on a buil@@ t-in theory of the economy , which enables them to “ assume ” certain relationships .
two key mistakes stand out .
the models used by all of the fore@@ casting organizations dramatically under@@ estimated the fiscal multipli@@ er : the impact of changes in government spending on output .
second , they over@@ estimated the extent to which quantitative e@@ asing ( q@@ e ) by the mon@@ etary authorities – that is , printing money – could counter@@ balance fiscal ti@@ ghten@@ ing .
until recently , the ob@@ r , broadly in line with the imf , assumed a fiscal multipli@@ er of 0.@@ 6 : for every dollar cut from government spending , the economy would shrink by only 60 cents .
this assumes “ ri@@ car@@ dian equi@@ valence ” : deb@@ t-@@ finan@@ ced public spending at least partly crowds out private spending through its impact on expectations and confidence .
if households and firms anticipate a tax increase in the future as a result of government borrowing today , they will reduce their consumption and investment accor@@ d@@ ingly .
on this view , if fiscal au@@ ster@@ ity relie@@ ves households of the burden of future tax increases , they will increase their spending .
this may be true when the economy is operating at full employment – when state and market are in competition for every last resource .
but when there is spare capacity in the economy , the resources “ fre@@ ed up ” by publi@@ c-@@ sector re@@ tren@@ chment may simply be wasted .
fore@@ casting organizations are finally admit@@ ting that they under@@ estimated the fiscal multipli@@ er .
the ob@@ r , re@@ viewing its recent mistakes , accepted that “ the average &#91; fiscal &#93; multipli@@ er over the two years would have needed to be 1.3 – more than double our estimate – to fully explain the weak level of gdp in 20@@ 1@@ 1-@@ 12 . ”
the imf has conce@@ ded that “ multipli@@ ers have actually been in the 0.@@ 9 and 1.@@ 7 range since the great recession . ”
the effect of under@@ esti@@ mating the fiscal multipli@@ er has been systematic mis@@ judgment of the damage that “ fiscal con@@ soli@@ dation ” does to the economy .
this leads us to the second mistake .
fore@@ ca@@ sters assumed that mon@@ etary expansion would provide an effective antidote to fiscal contra@@ ction .
the bank of england hoped that by printing £ 3@@ 75 billion of new money , ( $ 600 billion ) , it would stimulate total spending to the tune of £ 50 billion , or 3 % of gdp .
but the evidence emerging from succ@@ essive ro@@ unds of q@@ e in the uk and the us suggests that while it did lower bond yields , the extra money was largely re@@ tained within the banking system , and never reached the real economy .
this impli@@ es that the problem has mainly been a lack of demand for credit – rel@@ uc@@ tance on the part of businesses and households to borrow on almost any terms in a flat market .
these two mistakes com@@ po@@ unded each other : if the negative impact of au@@ ster@@ ity on economic growth is greater than was originally assumed , and the positive impact of quantitative e@@ asing is weaker , then the policy mix favor@@ ed by practically all european governments has been hugely wrong .
there is much greater scope for fiscal stimulus to boost growth , and much smaller scope for mon@@ etary stimulus .
this is all quite technical , but it matters a great deal for the welfare of populations .
all of these models assume outcomes on the basis of existing policies .
their consistent over-@@ optimism about these policies ’ impact on economic growth vali@@ dates pursuing them , and enables governments to claim that their reme@@ dies are “ working , ” when they clearly are not .
this is a cruel deception .
before they can do any good , the fore@@ ca@@ sters must go back to the drawing board , and ask themselves whether the theories of the economy under@@ pinn@@ ing their models are the right ones .
holl@@ an@@ de in mal@@ i
paris – while hundreds of thousands demonstrated in paris against the right of homo@@ sexual couples to marry and adopt children , french troops were arriving in mal@@ i to stop a coalition of islam@@ ist and rebel forces from taking control of its capital , ba@@ ma@@ ko , and creating in the sa@@ he@@ l a sanctu@@ ary for terrorists .
these are trying times for french president fran@@ ç@@ ois holl@@ an@@ de .
besie@@ ged economically at home , where his popul@@ arity is at its lowest since his election last year , can he regain credi@@ bility , if not support , as supreme commander of french forces ?
once upon a time , “ i intervene , therefore i am ” might as well have been a french motto , particularly in africa .
but , while french national identity is inti@@ mately bound up with france ’ s international standing – how it is perceived in the world – enthusiasm for intervention has re@@ ce@@ ded .
the benefits have become more du@@ bi@@ ous , while the costs and risks have grown increasingly evident .
if france has again become a regional gen@@ dar@@ me by default , it is largely for three reasons .
american enthusiasm for intervention in africa has greatly dimin@@ ished since the operation in somalia in 199@@ 2-@@ 1993 – and more globally following the long wars in iraq and afghanistan .
european interest in military intervention in africa is as low as ever .
and , as for the region ’ s governments , it would be an under@@ statement to say that they are not yet ready milit@@ arily to take their fate into their own hands .
while france is not alone – manife@@ stations of support have come from its western and african partners , as well as from the middle east – it will bear the primary responsibility and the risks .
for islamic fundament@@ alists , france is now the “ great sat@@ an . ”
indeed , the conflict in mal@@ i is taking place geographi@@ cally in africa , but in many ways its causes and rami@@ fi@@ cations lie in the middle east .
when france interven@@ ed in an african country in the past , there was no risk of terrorist attacks on its territory or on its citizens elsewhere in the world .
that is no longer the case .
it is too early to say what will happen in mal@@ i or the sa@@ he@@ l – or , for that matter , in france itself .
for the moment , the french are standing , overwhel@@ m@@ ingly , behind holl@@ an@@ de . they would have criticized him had he remained passive while ba@@ ma@@ ko fell into the hands of terrorists .
yet this support may be fragile , and could collapse if something goes wrong on the ground – or , worse , in france .
before the intervention , mal@@ i was not a french priority .
rising unemployment at home seemed to be a more urgent task than did addressing inst@@ ability in africa .
while the french public agrees that mal@@ i cannot be allowed to become a haven for terrorists , the way afghanistan did in the late 1990 ’ s , attitudes toward intervention have evolved in recent decades .
in the early 1980 ’ s , after a particularly bloody terrorist attack on french and american forces in lebanon , france ’ s tolerance for military casu@@ alties seemed much higher than that of the united states .
but this has changed .
the french now find themselves on the front line at a time when they have much less appeti@@ te for it .
moreover , budget restri@@ ctions have severely constrained french military capabilities .
french and british military intervention was successful in libya in 2011 at least in part as a result of us military pro@@ cu@@ rement .
of course , from a french perspective , the us role is somewhat ironic .
in the years after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , the americans always had to be on the front line – bat@@ tling the enemy abroad to avoid having to battle him at home , in the par@@ lan@@ ce of the time – while the european allies were perceived as the cleaning staff .
but imperial fa@@ ti@@ gue after iraq and afghanistan has left its im@@ print .
americans are starting to enjoy – probably too much for their allies – what president barack obama , describing the us role in libya , called “ leading from behind . ”
for holl@@ an@@ de , war in mal@@ i is both an opportunity and a risk .
if ni@@ col@@ as sar@@ ko@@ zy , whom he defeated , was widely regarded as “ too ” presidential , holl@@ an@@ de has given the impression of not being presidential “ enough . ”
his fall from public grace – too stati@@ st and fis@@ cally in@@ tru@@ sive for the right , but too moder@@ ate and social democratic for the true left – was more rapid than that of any president of the fifth republic .
of course , with unemployment rising every month , it is difficult to remain popular for long .
as the supreme commander of an army at war , holl@@ an@@ de can now try to reinvent himself .
but , succ@@ essive presidents since jacques chi@@ ra@@ c have failed to reconcile the french with politics .
france ’ s citizens have ten@@ ded to expect too much from their state , and now they may be expecting too little from politics and politicians at a time when deep di@@ visions on fundamental economic and social issues run not only between the traditional right and left , but also within both camps .
will foreign intervention re@@ unite the french ?
will war in africa be the defining moment of holl@@ an@@ de ’ s pres@@ iden@@ cy ?
will he be remembered as the french harry tru@@ man – a discre@@ et , un@@ charis@@ matic man who , when faced with urgent and dramatic circumstances , ended up doing the right things for lack of a better alternative ?
this is a port@@ ent@@ ous moment both for mal@@ i and for security in the sa@@ he@@ l and europe .
it is no less significant for holl@@ an@@ de and france .
paris – in less than two years , france has carried out three decisi@@ ve foreign military interventions .
in march 2011 , its air@@ strikes in libya ( alongside those of great britain ) th@@ war@@ ted col@@ on@@ el mu@@ am@@ mar el-@@ q@@ ad@@ da@@ fi ’ s troops as they prepared to re@@ take the city of ben@@ g@@ ha@@ zi .
a month later , french forces in c@@ ô@@ te d ’ i@@ vo@@ ire arrested president lau@@ rent g@@ bag@@ bo , who had refused to recognize his ri@@ val ’ s election victory , putting the country at risk of civil war .
now france has interven@@ ed in mal@@ i .
the latest intervention was initially planned as part of a european mission to support african forces , but france ab@@ rup@@ tly decided to act un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally to bl@@ unt the advance of islam@@ ists who threatened to over@@ run m@@ op@@ ti , the last barrier before reaching the capital , ba@@ ma@@ ko .
beyond that objective , france see@@ ks to protect its many nation@@ als in the region ; maintain stability in the sa@@ he@@ l , where states are very weak ; and prevent mal@@ i ’ s transformation into a base of islam@@ ist terrorism directed at europe .
a lot is at stake – all the more so because french intervention is likely to be extensive .
while the islam@@ ists have been tempor@@ arily defeated , they are well armed and receive supplies from libya via al@@ geria , which has supp@@ ressed islam@@ ists at home but seems to turn a blind eye to their transit through its territory .
moreover , the capabilities of the mali@@ an army and those of other west african countries that are supposed to join the operation are too weak to turn the tide .
the united states tried to train the mali@@ an army , but failed miser@@ ably .
so , with the security of europe as a whole at stake , why is france the only country involved ?
one explanation is to view the intervention as a neo-@@ coloni@@ al bid to protect a french preserve .
this is a profound error .
france has no interest in protecting a mali@@ an regime that it knows to be corrupt and in@@ competent ; indeed , france recently refused to support a request from president fran@@ ç@@ ois bo@@ zi@@ z@@ é ’ s regime in the neighbor@@ ing central african republic for aid in dealing with rebel@@ s .
france ’ s moti@@ vations are broader .
in particular , france has always considered sub-saharan africa and the arab world to be natural spheres of political and strategic influence that are necessary to maintaining its position as a global power .
the second explanation is more credible : france , aside from great britain , is europe ’ s only true military power .
it believes that operational military capability is a condition of power – a view that is not shared by the overwhelming majority of european states , which continue to display a collective aversion to war .
to be sure , europe has the means for joint action .
in 2003 , following the start of the iraq war , europe embraced a strategy prepared by ja@@ vier sol@@ ana , then the european union ’ s high representative for the common foreign and security policy .
but , while a large number of europeans nai@@ vely believed that this was the pr@@ elu@@ de to a joint european strategy , the proposal was dra@@ fted in terms that were so vague as to allow any outcome – or none .
the eu ’ s li@@ s@@ bon treaty men@@ tions “ permanent structured cooperation ” in security and defense policy , and an entire institutional apparatus of political and military commit@@ te@@ es exists to anticipate , prepare for , and implement military operations at the european level .
but this mechanism lac@@ ks the common political will needed to activate it ; the less it is used , the less usable it will become .
during the liby@@ an crisis , sol@@ ana ’ s success@@ or , catherine ash@@ ton , deliberately sought to limit the eu ’ s role to that of a super-@@ ngo focused on humanitarian aid and economic development .
recently , during the vote on palestinian representation at the united nations , the eu called for its members to ab@@ sta@@ in – an odd way to affir@@ m europe ’ s commitment to global leadership .
for great britain , europe@@ -@@ wide defense is a non@@ starter .
britain has devi@@ ated from this principle only once , when it agreed to participate in the at@@ al@@ anta anti-@@ pi@@ racy operation off the horn of africa – probably because it was placed in command .
as a result , those who want a common european defense capability lack the means to create it , while those who have the means to create it do not want it ( with the possible exception of france ) .
britain ’ s bil@@ ateral cooperation with france – high@@ ligh@@ ted during the liby@@ an crisis – is sometimes very strong .
but , despite the two countries ’ 2010 treaty on defense and security cooperation , the british have decided , for bud@@ ge@@ tary reasons , to acquire aircraft that will not be compatible with french aircraft carri@@ ers .
even spain and italy , the two countries most affected by developments in the mediterranean and the sa@@ he@@ l , have reduced their military expen@@ di@@ tures significantly .
unlike germany , both particip@@ ated in the liby@@ an intervention , but with highly limit@@ ing rules of engagement for their forces .
for example , italian na@@ val forces were instru@@ cted to avoid the waters off the coast of tri@@ pol@@ i , and spanish tan@@ ker aircraft were forbi@@ dden to re@@ fuel fi@@ ghter jets .
europe as a whole currently de@@ votes only 1.@@ 6 % of its gdp to defense , compared to 4.@@ 8 % for the us .
it is the only world region where military expen@@ di@@ tures are decre@@ asing .
its deployed forces are extremely small , accounting for 4 % of all military personnel worldwide , versus 14 % for the us .
industrial cooperation , which could constit@@ ute an economic and military asset , is also weak@@ ening , as demonstrated by germany ’ s successful opposition to the proposed e@@ ads / ba@@ e mer@@ ger , which was officially can@@ cel@@ ed in october .
germany had seemed to embar@@ k on a more robust policy since its participation in military operations in afghanistan .
now , however , it reco@@ ils at any prospect of military intervention , even as it remains the world ’ s third-@@ largest arms expor@@ ter .
europe is reluctant to develop a substantial military force , because the european project was created in opposition to the idea of power .
yet this stance has become un@@ ten@@ able .
europe faces real threats , which france alone cannot contain .
moreover , the international system is increasingly co@@ al@@ es@@ cing around national powers that consider military force to be an essential pr@@ er@@ equ@@ isi@@ te of influence . europe does not face a choice between soft and hard power .
it must combine both if it is to survive .
the french dis@@ connection
paris – di@@ re conditions can per@@ mit what was once un@@ thin@@ kable to push its way into public debate .
in france , the idea that now dar@@ es to speak its name is that the country will sink into an ever-@@ deeper economic mal@@ a@@ ise unless it re@@ gains its mon@@ etary sovereig@@ n@@ ty .
two striking statements on economic policy by france ’ s leaders in the first weeks of this year have high@@ ligh@@ ted the force of this logic .
first , president fran@@ ç@@ ois holl@@ an@@ de , worried about the euro ’ s appreciation against other major world curren@@ cies , called for an ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate target .
then , pierre mos@@ co@@ vic@@ i , the finance minister , said that europe might grant france a delay in meeting the 3 % -@@ of-@@ gdp bud@@ ge@@ t-@@ deficit target mand@@ ated from this year on@@ ward under the euro@@ zone ’ s newly rati@@ fied fiscal compact .
these positions imp@@ ly a desire to exercise sovereig@@ n power over the economic and mon@@ etary union ’ s rules and decisions .
back in 198@@ 9@@ -@@ 1991 , exactly the same motive under@@ lay president fran@@ ç@@ ois mit@@ terr@@ and ’ s im@@ position of the euro on germany – that is , to harness the bundes@@ bank ’ s mon@@ etary power to a framework in which france could be confident of wi@@ el@@ ding decisi@@ ve influence . since the single currency was france ’ s condition for accepting german re@@ uni@@ fication , germany played along .
two decades later , germany may be in a different mood .
the sovereig@@ n-@@ deb@@ t-@@ and-@@ banking crisis that has ro@@ iled the mon@@ etary union since 2010 has ste@@ adily exposed the realities at play here , as irre@@ voc@@ ably fixed exchange rates lock in and deep@@ en differences in euro@@ zone members ’ competi@@ tiveness .
in france ’ s case , the loss of competi@@ tiveness and resul@@ ting sharp decline in export performance has been ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ated by rel@@ ying on crus@@ hing tax@@ ation of labor to finance generous welfare programs and top-@@ dra@@ wer public services ( a practice exac@@ erb@@ ated by sti@@ fl@@ ing labor@@ -@@ market regulation ) .
in a mon@@ etary union , there are only two ways to close a competi@@ tiveness gap between countries : transfers from the more competitive to the less competitive , or internal de@@ valu@@ ation , which means real wage cuts .
not surprisingly , the preference has been for transfers , which , until the 2008 financial crash , took the form of cross-@@ border privat@@ e-@@ sector len@@ ding to governments and banks .
following the credi@@ t-@@ bubble burst in 2008 , fiscal transfers replaced these private financial flows , causing budget defic@@ its to balloon .
and now , with the german government , as chief credi@@ tor , calling the shots on cross-@@ border transfers to weaker euro@@ zone countries , all such transfers are condi@@ tional on au@@ ster@@ ity ( that is , internal de@@ valu@@ ation ) .
bail@@ outs from the european stability mechanism represent the clear@@ est example of this , with the fiscal compact now commit@@ ting sig@@ nat@@ ories to tight deficit targets and structural adju@@ st@@ ment .
and more au@@ ster@@ ity is a vital , if less well re@@ marked on , condition of the european central bank ’ s declared willingness to buy unlimited quantities of troubled countries ’ short-term government debt .
so far , the “ ba@@ zo@@ o@@ ka ” represented by the ec@@ b ’ s “ ou@@ tri@@ ght mon@@ etary trans@@ actions ” program has had the des@@ ired effect – without having to be used .
euro@@ zone financial markets have stabili@@ zed , and the euro has appreciated against the dollar and the yen .
but , as holl@@ an@@ de ’ s recent declar@@ ations indicate , currency appreciation is the last thing that an un@@ competitive country like france needs .
although the french government , unlike its spanish and italian counter@@ parts , has not yet had any difficulty finan@@ cing itself at low interest rates , currency appreciation as the economy slides into recession is like fuel poured onto an un@@ lit bon@@ fire .
unless growth is restored , france ’ s already large public debt will expand un@@ sustain@@ ably , hei@@ ghten@@ ing the risk that investors will shu@@ n french government bonds .
from this predi@@ cam@@ ent ste@@ ms the fashi@@ on@@ able idea that the bond market would actually welcome less fiscal au@@ ster@@ ity , because this would boost economic growth , in turn making the level of public debt appear more sustainable in the long run . it is no surprise that mos@@ co@@ vic@@ i is beginning to push for a “ collective european decision ” to relax the fiscal treaty ’ s terms , given that french compli@@ ance would require massive new spending cuts .
will germany agree to such a relax@@ ation – or , for that matter , to holl@@ an@@ de ’ s implic@@ it demand that the ec@@ b follow japan ’ s example and loo@@ sen mon@@ etary policy to drive the exchange rate back down ?
unlike japan ( and , of course , the united states ) , france , as a member of a mon@@ etary union , cannot pursue domestic goals un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally .
to avoid disaster , france has only two options : somehow force a change in german policy or go it alone .
there are two reasons why , until now , the second option – leaving the mon@@ etary union – has been un@@ thin@@ kable .
the first has to do with economic and financial risks . di@@ tching the euro might trigger a banking crisis , capital flight , inflation , and perhaps even sovereig@@ n default .
on the other hand , higher competi@@ tiveness and erosion of the real value of debt would quickly out@@ weigh these costs by restor@@ ing confidence in the french economy ’ s pro@@ spe@@ cts .
this strategy ’ s success , starting with the speed of restored access to external finan@@ cing , would depend on the credi@@ bility of government policies – mon@@ etary , fiscal , and , above all , the radical and in@@ dispen@@ s@@ able sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ side reforms for which there would now be breathing space .
the spec@@ ter of continuing economic stag@@ nation and ever-@@ rising unemployment ( with the young and older workers being the worst hit ) should remove the second , geo@@ political obstacle to a french exit from the euro@@ zone .
for french elites since world war ii , alig@@ nment with germany has been central to projecting french power and influence .
such ambi@@ tions must now be sacrifi@@ ced for the sake of the french public ’ s well-being .
france will not regain its economic strength without setting aside the euro .
even during that adju@@ st@@ ment , there is no reason why relations with european partners should suffer in any fundamental sense .
on the contrary , the sustainable prosperity that would result from that adju@@ st@@ ment would create a much healthier long-term foundation for continuing the quest for an “ ever closer union ” in europe .
why france will sink europe ’ s constitution
if public opinion polls are to be believed , on may 29 the french will reject the european union ’ s dra@@ ft constitu@@ tional treaty . because all eu member countries must rati@@ fy the constitution , a french “ non ” will , in effect , kill it .
amazing as this turn of events seems , it has been long in the making .
it is amazing because france is not just a founding member of the european community , but also has been the main driving force behind all major steps toward “ ever closer union . ”
but french opposition was also predictable because , for over a decade now , france has ve@@ ered away from europe and now finds itself increasingly isolated .
of course , europe has also moved away from france through succ@@ essive en@@ lar@@ ge@@ ments , but the main roots of the e@@ str@@ ange@@ ment lie in france itself .
the french regard with great sadness their declining status and prestige – not only in world politics , but also in culture , science and , importantly , language .
europe , in their view , was always a way of recla@@ iming world influence .
for three decades , this worked .
france and germany had for@@ ged an alliance that called the shots in europe .
not interested in geo@@ political power – a legacy of its nazi past – germany was content to back france ’ s ambi@@ tions as long as the common market allowed it to be europe ’ s economic power@@ house .
but that alliance is un@@ ra@@ veling as germany ’ s own status dec@@ lines , o@@ wing to its medi@@ oc@@ re economic performance and the loss of its pre@@ sti@@ gi@@ ous deutsch@@ em@@ ark .
moreover , germany is increasingly interested in exercis@@ ing political influence on its own ; as a result , it is no longer happy with what it gets from the alliance with france .
at the same time , succ@@ essive eu en@@ lar@@ ge@@ ments over the decades have brought in other powerful con@@ ten@@ ders , chie@@ fly spain and the uk , as well as smaller countries who are un@@ willing to bow before fren@@ ch-@@ german leadership .
in short , france has lost control of europe .
this is not new , but it has only recently started to sink in , and it hurts .
france is also economically wounded .
here is a country that has long cher@@ ished its “ exception ” from the normal rules of market economics , a f@@ og@@ gy view that reje@@ cts both central planning and free markets and claims to offer a well-@@ balanced middle ground .
the french do not care that they have never been able to articulate their vision of a “ third way , ” for they remain deeply convinced that the state has a key role to play in steering markets in order to defend “ higher ” values from the single-@@ minded pursuit of materi@@ alism .
this view , propag@@ ated since world war ii by a qu@@ asi@@ -@@ mar@@ x@@ ist intelligent@@ sia , is so ing@@ ra@@ ined that the french do not even bother to understand how markets operate .
they look upon economics as an ideological battle@@ ground , where all views can be enter@@ tained without being confronted with logic , much less with facts .
yet facts have been hitting hard .
growth has been lac@@ klu@@ ster for a quarter of a century and unemployment remains stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly high .
urban crime , once described as the wages of un@@ fe@@ ttered individu@@ alism , now resem@@ bles what is found in the united states , the french model ’ s b@@ ê@@ te no@@ ire .
what has this to do with europe ?
the eu , by design , increases economic competition , but france is ill equipped .
one after the other , most european countries have re@@ formed their economies , she@@ dding the co@@ zy arrangements that used to protect every interest group from the pressure of competition .
even germany , after even worse performance than france , has now taken decisi@@ ve steps .
unable to reform their labor markets because of the fear of street prote@@ sts , french governments of all political stri@@ pes seek to protect their a@@ iling firms , only to face limits imposed by the rules of the common market .
the blo@@ ated french public sector , which many see as the emplo@@ yer of last resort , cannot afford its expensive personnel .
while many private french firms are thriving , they do so by econom@@ izing on man@@ power and , increasingly , by outsour@@ cing production , often to new eu member countries where labor costs are consider@@ ably lower .
public education is in sham@@ bles and france ’ s higher education system now faces competition from other european countries .
hum@@ bled by economic mal@@ a@@ ise and loss of influence , the french are scared .
they fear the future , because the future means either market@@ -@@ oriented reforms or further economic and political down@@ gra@@ ding , both of which are seen as unacceptable , if only because they clash with french self-esteem .
the european constitution has little to do with any of these challenges , but a majority of french people has started questioning the strategy that has long ma@@ sk@@ ed france ’ s dimin@@ ishing status .
they are al@@ armed by what they see as the dom@@ ination of an@@ glo@@ -@@ sa@@ xon economic principles – the last nail in the co@@ ff@@ in of france ’ s myth@@ ical “ exception . ”
so the eu is now seen as the tro@@ jan horse that threat@@ ens the myri@@ ad of state-@@ sanc@@ tioned benefits and hand@@ outs that every citizen enjo@@ ys .
of course , most french people would ultimately benefit from doing away with this inefficient web of big and small privile@@ ges , but most voters , depressed by poor economic pro@@ spe@@ cts and un@@ ner@@ ved by high unemployment , are simply un@@ willing to take the risk .
they do not understand the roots of their economic trou@@ bles and are nostal@@ gic for better times .
they mista@@ ken@@ ly see the european constitution as one more challenge , at a time when they want to be nur@@ sed and protected .
scared people rarely make wise choices .
why free trade matters
new york – contrary to what skep@@ tics often ass@@ ert , the case for free trade is robust .
it exten@@ ds not just to overall prosperity ( or “ aggregate gn@@ p ” ) , but also to distribu@@ tional outcomes , which makes the free-@@ trade argument morally compelling as well .
the link between trade openness and economic prosperity is strong and suggesti@@ ve .
for example , ar@@ v@@ ind pan@@ ag@@ ari@@ ya of columbia university divided developing countries into two groups : “ miracle ” countries that had annual per capita gdp growth rates of 3 % or higher , and “ de@@ bac@@ le ” countries that had negative or zero growth rates .
pan@@ ag@@ ari@@ ya found commen@@ su@@ rate corresponding growth rates of trade for both groups in the period 196@@ 1-@@ 1999 .
of course , it could be argued that gdp growth causes trade growth , rather than vice versa – that is , until one exam@@ ines the countries in depth .
nor can one argue that trade growth has little to do with trade policy : while lower transport costs have increased trade volumes , so has steady reduction of trade barriers .
more compelling is the dramatic up@@ turn in gdp growth rates in india and china after they turned strongly towards dis@@ man@@ tling trade barriers in the late 1980 ’ s and early 1990 ’ s .
in both countries , the decision to reverse prote@@ c@@ tionist policies was not the only reform under@@ taken , but it was an important component .
in the developed countries , too , trade liber@@ alization , which started earlier in the post@@ war period , was accompanied by other forms of economic opening ( for example , a return to currency conver@@ ti@@ bility ) , resul@@ ting in rapid gdp growth .
economic expansion was interrupted in the 1970 ’ s and 1980 ’ s , but the cause was the macro@@ economic crises triggered by the success of the opec car@@ tel and the en@@ su@@ ing de@@ fla@@ tionary policies pursu@@ ed by th@@ en-@@ federal reserve chair@@ man paul vol@@ cker .
moreover , the negative argument that historical experience supports the case for prote@@ c@@ tion@@ ism is fla@@ wed .
the economic historian douglas ir@@ win has challenged the argument that n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ century prote@@ c@@ tionist policy ai@@ ded the growth of infant industries in the united states .
he has also shown that many of the n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth century ’ s successful high-@@ tari@@ ff countries , such as canada and argentina , used tari@@ ffs as a revenue source , not as a means of shel@@ tering domestic manufacturers .
nor should free tra@@ ders worry that trade openness resulted in no additional growth for some developing countries , as cri@@ tics con@@ tend .
trade is only a facili@@ tating device .
for instance , if your infrastructure is bad , or you have domestic policies that prevent investors from responding to market opportunities ( such as south asia ’ s sti@@ fl@@ ing licen@@ sing restri@@ ctions ) , you will see no results .
to gain from trade openness , you have to ensure that comple@@ mentary policies are in place .
but then cri@@ tics shift ground and argue that trade-@@ driven growth benefits only the elites and not the poor ; it is not “ inclusive . ”
in india , however , the shift to accelerated growth after reforms that included trade liber@@ alization has pulled nearly 200 million people out of poverty .
in china , which grew faster , it is estimated that more than 300 million people have moved above the poverty line since the start of reforms .
in fact , developed countries benefit from trade ’ s effect on poverty reduction as well .
contrary to much popular opinion , trade with poor countries does not pau@@ peri@@ ze rich countries .
the opposite is true .
it is uns@@ killed , labor@@ -@@ saving technical change that is putting pressure on the wages of workers , whereas impor@@ ts of cheaper , labor@@ -@@ intensive goods from developing countries help the poor who consume these goods .
if fre@@ er trade reduces poverty , it is presum@@ p@@ tu@@ ous for the cri@@ tics to claim greater virtue .
in truth , the free tra@@ ders control the moral high ground : with at least a billion people still living in poverty , what greater moral imperative do we have than to reduce that number ?
talk about “ social justice ” is in@@ to@@ xic@@ ating , but actually doing something about it is difficult .
here the free tra@@ ders have a distinct edge .
as the historian frank tr@@ ent@@ mann has demonstrated , the case for free trade was made in n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ century britain in moral terms : it was held to promote not just economic prosperity , but also peace .
it is also worth rec@@ alling that us secretary of state cor@@ d@@ ell h@@ ull was awar@@ ded the nobel peace prize in 1945 for policies that included his ti@@ rel@@ ess efforts on behalf of multi@@ lat@@ eral free trade .
it is time for the norwe@@ gian nobel committee to step up again .
rule , ger@@ man@@ ia
princeton – a persistent theme – indeed the leit@@ moti@@ f – of the way that german leaders discuss the euro@@ zone is their insi@@ stence on the importance of following the rules .
that refra@@ in is followed by a chor@@ us from the rest of the mon@@ etary union demanding to know why germany is taking such an in@@ flexible approach .
the answer , it turns out , reflects the way germany ’ s federal system of government has shaped its decision-making , as well as germany ’ s historic experience with debt crises .
germany ’ s obsession with rules long predat@@ es the current euro@@ zone crisis .
the country ’ s policymakers always insisted that europe could not have a common currency without first achieving economic convergence .
but that looked like it would never happen .
so , in the 1990s , as the euro@@ zone was being established , germany argued for rigorous en@@ for@@ cement of the “ convergence criteria , ” the requirements necessary for adopting the euro .
economists in every other country ridicul@@ ed the teu@@ ton@@ ic fix@@ ation on firm rules .
there is no reason , for example , why a deb@@ t-@@ to-@@ gdp ratio of 59 % should be considered safe , but 62 % regarded as ir@@ responsi@@ bly dangerous .
but the ger@@ mans insisted – and ultimately got what they wanted .
that approach ste@@ mmed in part from germany ’ s political structure .
the more federal a country ’ s system of government is , the more rules are needed to ensure its smooth functioning .
when the responsibilities of different levels of government are not clearly deli@@ mit@@ ed , there is the danger that officials will try to pass bur@@ dens to higher levels .
in order to avoid this , feder@@ ations often adopt a leg@@ alistic approach .
indeed , there is a strong correlation , historically , between successful feder@@ ations and a stable mon@@ etary policy under@@ gir@@ ded by clear rules .
in the late twen@@ tieth century , switzerland , germany , and the united states – all federal countries – were pione@@ ers in applying a stabili@@ ty-@@ oriented mon@@ etary policy .
given that the euro@@ zone is in many ways federal in its structure , a clear commitment to the rules seemed to germany to be a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ isi@@ te for its success .
to be sure , even ger@@ mans know that rules sometimes need to be bent .
thinkers as far back as aristotle have argued that rules fail when they are too rigid .
in the ni@@ co@@ ma@@ che@@ an ethics , aristotle pointed to the use by sculp@@ tors on the island of les@@ bos of rul@@ ers made from flexible lead – rather than rigid iron – for cutting curved lines in stone .
the ability to res@@ ha@@ pe the rul@@ ers to fit the stone served as a metaphor for the need to adjust laws when circum@@ stance change .
but when it comes to debt , ger@@ mans have insisted on using the most rigid of rul@@ ers .
since the beginning of the euro@@ zone crisis , the german government dug in its he@@ els on european treaty pro@@ visions that it interpre@@ ts as forbi@@ dding bail@@ outs and mon@@ etary finan@@ cing of government debt .
recently , germany re@@ acted to a proposal to forgive a portion of greece ’ s debt by maintaining that the treaty pro@@ vision that pro@@ scri@@ bes bail@@ outs also rules out state bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cies and debt forgiveness .
the lesson that germany has taken from its history is that debt is an area in which flexibility must be ste@@ ad@@ fa@@ stly avoi@@ ded .
this might come as a surprise to american comm@@ ent@@ ators , who have argued that germany is acting hypo@@ critically , having de@@ faul@@ ted on its deb@@ ts in 19@@ 23 , 193@@ 2-@@ 193@@ 3 , 1945 , and 1953 , only to insist today that others do differently .
the truth is that ger@@ mans viewed nearly all of those de@@ faul@@ ts as dest@@ abili@@ zing .
the internal default in 19@@ 23 , conducted via hyper@@ inflation , weak@@ ened the german financial system and helped cause the great depression .
the de@@ faul@@ ts in the early 1930s became inevitable when germany could not access private capital markets and the country had lost faith in its future .
rather than set the stage for a sustainable economic recovery , def@@ lation and default fan@@ ned the flames of nation@@ alism – to disa@@ strous effect .
the default of 1945 was the consequence of losing world war ii .
indeed , the tradition of so-called or@@ do@@ liber@@ alism that has shaped germany ’ s post-@@ war economic policy was a response to the nazis ’ destructive arbit@@ rar@@ iness .
only the debt can@@ cell@@ ation of 1953 is viewed in a positive light in germany , and a look at the circumstances in which it occurred reveals much about the country ’ s approach to the euro@@ zone crisis .
as the yale economist timothy guinn@@ ane has shown , the debt that was can@@ cel@@ ed was not the principal , but accum@@ ulated interest arre@@ ars that had not been paid between the great depression and w@@ wi@@ i .
more important , from germany ’ s perspective , was the political context in which the negotiations took place .
for star@@ ters , there had been a complete regime change in germany .
the victor@@ i@@ ous allies had removed those responsible for the destructive , dest@@ abili@@ zing policies of the past , providing the country with a clean break and its deb@@ tors with confidence that germany was on a new course .
furthermore , germany ’ s new policymakers had demonstrated their financial seriousness .
in 1950 , the country had under@@ gone a severe bal@@ ance@@ -@@ of-@@ payments crisis .
some officials were in favor of capital controls , but the government instead implemented mon@@ etary au@@ ster@@ ity .
this experience explains another of germany ’ s obs@@ essions : reforms in deb@@ tor countries .
germany needed a complete change of its domestic regime to break out of its cycle of debt and default .
that might be a bit much to ask in the context of the euro@@ zone ; but , without a fundamental re@@ orientation of a country ’ s politics , the thinking in germany goes , debt forgiveness will always remain a fu@@ tile exercise .
why germany should lead or leave
new york – europe has been in a financial crisis since 2007 .
when the bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy of le@@ hman brothers endangered the credit of financial institutions , private credit was replaced by the credit of the state , revealing an un@@ recognized fla@@ w in the euro .
by transfer@@ ring their right to print money to the european central bank ( ec@@ b ) , member countries exposed themselves to the risk of default , like third world countries heavily inde@@ b@@ ted in a foreign currency .
commercial banks loaded with weaker countries ’ government bonds became potentially in@@ sol@@ vent .
there is a parallel between the ongoing euro crisis and the international banking crisis of 1982 .
back then , the international mon@@ etary fund saved the global banking system by len@@ ding just enough money to heavily inde@@ b@@ ted countries ; default was avoi@@ ded , but at the cost of a lasting depression .
latin america suffered a lost decade .
germany is playing the same role today as the imf did then .
the setting diff@@ ers , but the effect is the same .
credi@@ tors are shifting the entire burden of adju@@ st@@ ment on to the deb@@ tor countries and avoiding their own responsibility .
the euro crisis is a complex mixture of banking and sovereig@@ n-@@ debt problems , as well as diver@@ gen@@ ces in economic performance that have given rise to bal@@ ance@@ -@@ of-@@ payments im@@ balances within the euro@@ zone .
the authorities did not understand the complexity of the crisis , let alone see a solution . so they tried to buy time .
usually , that works .
financial pan@@ ics sub@@ side , and the authorities realize a profit on their intervention .
but not this time , because the financial problems were combined with a process of political dis@@ integration .
when the european union was created , it was the embodi@@ ment of an open society – a voluntary association of equal states that sur@@ rendered part of their sovereig@@ n@@ ty for the common good .
the euro crisis is now turning the eu into something fundamentally different , dividing member countries into two classes – credi@@ tors and deb@@ tors – with the credi@@ tors in charge .
as the strongest credi@@ tor country , germany has emerged as the he@@ gem@@ on .
deb@@ tor countries pay substantial risk premi@@ ums for finan@@ cing their government debt .
this is reflected in their cost of finan@@ cing in general .
to make matters worse , the bundes@@ bank remains committed to an out@@ mo@@ ded mon@@ etary doctrine rooted in germany ’ s traumatic experience with inflation .
as a result , it recognizes only inflation as a threat to stability , and ignor@@ es def@@ lation , which is the real threat today .
moreover , germany ’ s insi@@ stence on au@@ ster@@ ity for deb@@ tor countries can easily become counter@@ productive by increasing the debt ratio as gdp falls .
there is a real danger that a two-@@ tier europe will become permanent . both human and financial resources will be attracted to the center , leaving the peripher@@ y permanently depressed .
but the peripher@@ y is see@@ thing with dis@@ content .
europe ’ s tragedy is not the result of an evil plot , but ste@@ ms , rather , from a lack of coherent policies .
as in ancient greek tragedies , mis@@ conceptions and a sheer lack of understanding have had unintended but f@@ ateful consequences .
germany , as the largest credi@@ tor country , is in charge , but ref@@ uses to take on additional li@@ abilities ; as a result , every opportunity to resolve the crisis has been missed .
the crisis spread from greece to other deficit countries , eventually calling into question the euro ’ s very survival .
since a break@@ up of the euro would cause immense damage , germany always does the minimum necessary to hold it together .
most recently , german chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a mer@@ kel has backed ec@@ b president mari@@ o dra@@ gh@@ i , leaving bundes@@ bank president j@@ ens wei@@ d@@ mann isolated .
this will enable the ec@@ b to put a li@@ d on the borrowing costs of countries that submit to an au@@ ster@@ ity program under the super@@ vision of the tro@@ i@@ ka ( the imf , the ec@@ b , and the european commission ) .
that will save the euro , but it is also a step toward the permanent division of europe into deb@@ tors and credi@@ tors .
the deb@@ tors are bound to reject a two-@@ tier europe sooner or later .
if the euro breaks up in dis@@ array , the common market and the eu will be destroyed , leaving europe worse off than it was when the effort to unite it began , o@@ wing to a legacy of mutual mi@@ str@@ ust and hosti@@ lity .
the later the break@@ up , the worse the ultimate outcome .
so it is time to consider alternatives that until recently would have been in@@ concei@@ vable .
in my judgment , the best course of action is to persuade germany to choose between either leading the creation of a political union with genuine bur@@ den-@@ sharing , or leaving the euro .
since all of the accum@@ ulated debt is denomin@@ ated in euros , it makes all the difference who remains in charge of the mon@@ etary uni@@ on@@ .@@ if germany left , the euro would de@@ preci@@ ate .
deb@@ tor countries would regain their competi@@ tiveness ; their debt would dimin@@ ish in real terms ; and , with the ec@@ b under their control , the threat of default would disappear and their borrowing costs would fall to levels comparable to that in the united kingdom .
the credi@@ tor countries , by contrast , would incu@@ r losses on their claims and investments denomin@@ ated in euros and encounter sti@@ ffer competition at home from other euro@@ zone members .
the extent of credi@@ tor countries ’ losses would depend on the extent of the de@@ preci@@ ation , giving them an interest in keeping the de@@ preci@@ ation within bo@@ unds .
after initial dis@@ locations , the event@@ ual outcome would fulfill john may@@ n@@ ard key@@ nes ’ dream of an international currency system in which both credi@@ tors and deb@@ tors share responsibility for maintaining stability .
and europe would aver@@ t the lo@@ oming depression .
the same result could be achieved , with less cost to germany , if germany chose to behave as a ben@@ evol@@ ent he@@ gem@@ on .
that would mean imple@@ menting the proposed european banking union ; establi@@ shing a more or less level playing field between deb@@ tor and credi@@ tor countries by establi@@ shing a debt reduction fund , and eventually conver@@ ting all debt into euro@@ bonds ; and a@@ iming at nomin@@ al gdp growth of up to 5 % , so that europe could grow its way out of exc@@ essive inde@@ b@@ tedness .
why greece declined a euro holiday
brus@@ sels – for the entire first half of this year , since the far-@@ left , anti-@@ au@@ ster@@ ity sy@@ ri@@ za party came to power in january , the greek sa@@ ga virtually mono@@ poli@@ zed the attention of european policymakers .
even as their country ’ s economy crashed , greece ’ s new government remained ad@@ am@@ ant in demanding debt relief without au@@ ster@@ ity – that is , until mid-@@ july , when they suddenly agreed to the credi@@ tors ’ terms .
indeed , as of july 13 , greece ’ s sta@@ un@@ ch@@ ly anti-@@ au@@ ster@@ ity government has been obli@@ ged to impose even tougher au@@ ster@@ ity and pursue painful structural reforms , under its credi@@ tors ’ close super@@ vision .
why did the greek government conce@@ de to terms that not only contro@@ ver@@ ted its own promises , but also closely resem@@ bled those that voters had overwhel@@ m@@ ingly rejected in a popular refer@@ end@@ um barely a week earlier ?
many believe that greek prime minister alexis t@@ si@@ pr@@ as was responding to an ulti@@ mat@@ um from his european partners : accept our demands or leave the euro .
the question is why a greek exit from the euro ( “ gre@@ x@@ it ” ) amo@@ unted to such a potent threat .
in fact , from an economic perspective , gre@@ x@@ it no longer represents the potential catastrophe that it once did .
after all , the main short-term cost – finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ system dis@@ ruption – has already materi@@ alized in greece : banks and the stock market have been shut down , and capital controls have been imposed .
while those actions were needed to stem large-scale capital flight and prevent the banking system ’ s collapse , they also caused the greek economy to contract shar@@ ply .
in this context , greek negoti@@ ators might have considered another proposal , circul@@ ated inform@@ ally by the german finance ministry , recommen@@ ding that greece receive immediate debt forgiveness , in exchange for leaving the euro tempor@@ arily .
if greece remained in the euro , no relief would be granted – a pro@@ vis@@ o consistent with the german position that debt re@@ struc@@ turing for euro@@ zone countries would be illegal .
while the legal argument is probably spu@@ ri@@ ous , an ou@@ tri@@ ght debt reduction for a euro@@ zone country remains politically impossible .
the german proposal , spe@@ ar@@ headed by finance minister wolf@@ gang sch@@ äu@@ ble , high@@ lights the fundamental change that has occurred in greece ’ s relationship with its european partners since its last bail@@ out package three years ago . in 2012 , greece was offered hundreds of billions of euros in financial support , and its credi@@ tors , including greek commercial banks , were pushed to accept substantial “ voluntary ” hair@@ cuts .
tell@@ ingly , when george pa@@ p@@ andre@@ o@@ u , greece ’ s prime minister at the time , proposed a refer@@ end@@ um on the existing adju@@ st@@ ment program and his country ’ s continued euro@@ zone mem@@ ber@@ ship in 2011 , he was war@@ ned off in no un@@ certain terms by france ’ s th@@ en-@@ president ni@@ col@@ as sar@@ ko@@ zy and german chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a mer@@ kel .
though pa@@ p@@ andre@@ o@@ u would have campaig@@ ned for the adju@@ st@@ ment program and the euro , a refer@@ end@@ um was a risk that his european partners were un@@ willing to take .
t@@ si@@ pr@@ as ’ s government , by contrast , was able to hold its refer@@ end@@ um , and even campaign against the credi@@ tors ’ proposed adju@@ st@@ ment program ( which , it should be not@@ ed , was no longer on the table ) .
even the res@@ o@@ unding “ no ” delivered by greek voters could not streng@@ then the government ’ s negotiating position , for a simple reason : gre@@ x@@ it is no longer considered a threat to the euro ’ s stability .
that is why german officials – especially sch@@ äu@@ ble – have been encouraging greece to leave .
one can only specu@@ late about sch@@ äu@@ ble ’ s motivation in pushing for gre@@ x@@ it .
he seems to believe that a more integrated euro@@ zone , though certainly des@@ ir@@ able , is not feasi@@ ble with a country that cannot be trusted to ab@@ ide by the terms to which its government has agreed .
whatever sch@@ äu@@ ble ’ s reasons , his proposal could have represented a way out for greece , whose economy had been squee@@ zed dry by au@@ ster@@ ity and whose banking system was already closed .
immediate debt reduction and the recovery of economic sovereig@@ n@@ ty – even at the expense of ex@@ iting the euro , at least tempor@@ arily – would seem to have offered significant long-term benefits .
in a sense , it amo@@ unted to a golden opportunity , with germany offering to pay for something that many believe greece should be doing anyway .
nonetheless , the greek government rejected an exit , and instead accepted the credi@@ tors ’ tough terms .
this suggests that , during the negotiations , greece ’ s leaders were driven by more than economics .
perhaps , contrary to popular belief , countries ’ political attachment to europe via the euro remains very strong , even where , as in greece , people have en@@ du@@ red unprecedented hard@@ ship since joining the mon@@ etary union .
the mon@@ etary union ’ s rationale , as many have not@@ ed , was always more political than economic .
for precisely that reason , it may well be too early to write off the single currency .
why greece will default
cambridge – greece will default on its national debt .
that default will be due in large part to its mem@@ ber@@ ship in the european mon@@ etary union .
if it were not part of the euro system , greece might not have gotten into its current predi@@ cam@@ ent and , even if it had gotten into its current predi@@ cam@@ ent , it could have avoi@@ ded the need to default .
greece ’ s default on its national debt need not mean an explicit ref@@ us@@ al to make principal and interest payments when they come due .
more likely would be an im@@ f-@@ organized re@@ struc@@ turing of the existing debt , swa@@ pping new bonds with lower principal and interest for existing bonds .
or it could be a “ soft default ” in which greece un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally services its existing debt with new debt rather than paying in cash .
but , whatever form the default takes , the current owners of greek debt will get less than the full amount that they are now o@@ wed .
the only way that greece could avoid a default would be by cutting its future annual budget defic@@ its to a level that foreign and domestic investors would be willing to finance on a voluntary basis .
at a minimum , that would mean reducing the deficit to a level that stops the rise in the deb@@ t-@@ to-@@ gdp ratio .
to achieve that , the current deficit of 14 % of gdp would have to fall to 5 % of gdp or less .
but to bring the deb@@ t-@@ to-@@ gdp ratio to the 60 % level prescri@@ bed by the ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht treaty would require reducing the annual budget deficit to just 3 % of gdp – the goal that the euro@@ zone ’ s finance ministers have said that greece must achieve by 2012 .
reducing the budget deficit by 10 % of gdp would mean an enormous cut in government spending or a dramatic rise in tax revenue – or , more likely , both .
quite apart from the political difficulty of achieving this would be the very serious ad@@ verse effect on aggregate domestic demand , and therefore on production and employment .
greece ’ s unemployment rate already is 10 % , and its gdp is already expected to fall at an annual rate of more than 4 % , pushing job@@ lessness even higher .
depressing economic activity further through higher taxes and reduced government spending would cause off@@ setting reduc@@ tions in tax revenue and off@@ setting increases in transfer payments to the unemployed .
so every planned euro of deficit reduction delivers less than a euro of actual deficit reduction .
that means that planned tax increases and cuts in basic government spending would have to be even larger than 10 % of gdp in order to achieve a 3 % -@@ of-@@ gdp budget deficit .
there simply is no way around the arithmetic impli@@ ed by the scale of deficit reduction and the ac@@ compan@@ ying economic decline : greece ’ s default on its debt is inevitable .
greece might have been able to avoid that outcome if it were not in the euro@@ zone .
if greece still had its own currency , the authorities could de@@ value it while ti@@ ghten@@ ing fiscal policy .
a de@@ valued currency would increase exports and would cause greek households and firms to substitute domestic products for impor@@ ted goods .
the increased demand for greek goods and services would raise greece ’ s gdp , increasing tax revenue and reducing transfer payments .
in short , fiscal con@@ soli@@ dation would be both easier and less painful if greece had its own mon@@ etary policy .
greece ’ s mem@@ ber@@ ship in the euro@@ zone was also a principal cause of its current large budget deficit .
because greece has not had its own currency for more than a decade , there has been no market signal to warn greece that its debt was growing un@@ accep@@ tably large .
if greece had remained outside the euro@@ zone and re@@ tained the dra@@ ch@@ ma , the large increased supply of greek bonds would cause the dra@@ ch@@ ma to decline and the interest rate on the bonds to rise .
but , because greek euro bonds were regarded as a close substitute for other countries ’ euro bonds , the interest rate on greek bonds did not rise as greece increased its borrowing – until the market began to fear a possible default .
the substantial surge in the interest rate on greek bonds relative to german bonds in the past few weeks shows that the market now regar@@ ds such a default as increasingly likely .
the combination of credi@@ ts from the other euro@@ zone countries and len@@ ding by the imf may provide enough liqui@@ dity to sta@@ ve off default for a while .
in exchange for this liqui@@ dity support , greece will be forced to accept painful fiscal ti@@ ghten@@ ing and falling gdp .
in the end , greece , the euro@@ zone ’ s other members , and greece ’ s credi@@ tors will have to accept that the country is in@@ sol@@ vent and cannot service its existing debt .
at that point , greece will default .
why has america ’ s economic recovery st@@ alled ?
cambridge – the united states ’ import bill now exce@@ eds $ 2.@@ 4 trillion a year , more than twice that of china and greater than that of the 27 european union countries combined .
since the volume of us impor@@ ts var@@ ies with the overall strength of the american economy , so does the volume of other countries ’ exports .
so it was good news for everyone when the us economy began expanding in the summer of 2009 , 19 months after falling into the recession that officially started in december 2007 .
unfortunately , the recovery has turned out to be very ane@@ mic .
now , 15 months into the expansion , the level of real gdp is still lower than it was when the recession started .
even more worrying , the rate of gdp growth has been declining almost from the start of the recovery .
real gdp rose by 5 % in the fourth quarter of 2009 , reflecting the end of the decline in invent@@ ories .
gdp growth then fell to 3.@@ 7 % in the first quarter of 2010 and to only 1.@@ 7 % in the second quarter .
the third quarter is shaping up to be much like the second .
this recovery has been much weaker than previous ones because of fundamental differences in the cause of the down@@ turn and in the policies chosen to achieve recovery .
previous down@@ turns were caused by the central bank ’ s efforts to reverse or prevent inflation by hi@@ king short-term interest rates .
when the central bank succeeded , it lower@@ ed those rates and the economy boun@@ ced back .
but this time the down@@ turn was not caused by higher interest rates , and reducing those rates did not produce a strong re@@ bound .
this recession was caused by a mis@@ pricing of risk , leading to exc@@ essive leverage and high prices for a wide range of assets .
when those price bubbles burst , households lost substantial wealth and financial markets became dys@@ functional .
because the down@@ turn was not caused by high interest rates , lower@@ ing them could not lift the economy out of recession .
the obama administration therefore turned to fiscal policy – tax cuts and a range of spending programs .
unfortunately , the fiscal stimulus was not well enough designed to get the economy onto a strong , self-@@ sustaining growth path .
and , now that those stimulus programs are coming to an end , there is a danger that the economy will slide back into slow growth or even recession .
one key to the us economy ’ s future is household demand .
although consumer spending has increased during the past four quarters , helped by substantial government transfer payments , the pace of spending growth by households was less than the overall pace of gdp growth , because households were increasing their rate of saving .
indeed , household saving rose from 2 % of after@@ -@@ tax incomes in 2007 to about 6 % in recent months .
if the saving rate continues to rise at the same pace in the future as it has over the past three years , the overall gdp growth rate could turn negative after a few quarters .
of course , there is no way to be certain of what will happen to saving .
but it is worth remembering that the saving rate aver@@ aged 9 % in the quar@@ ter-@@ century from 1960 to 1985 .
if the saving rate now rises quickly to that level , it will be hard to keep overall gdp growing .
a significantly higher saving rate would help the us economy in the long run , but it would be a barrier to robust growth in the next few years .
a major obstacle to higher consumer spending is the current condition of the housing market .
the rapid rise in house prices until 2006 caused households to increase their spending , finan@@ ced in part by conver@@ ting home equity into cash .
but house prices have since fallen some 40 % on average , leaving one-third of home@@ owners with mort@@ g@@ ages o@@ wing more than their house is worth .
the resul@@ ting fall in wealth has reduced consumer spending , while the decline in home@@ owners ’ equity prevents borrowing to finance any increase .
and the recent end of a special tax subsi@@ dy for first-@@ time home@@ bu@@ yers has caused house prices to start falling again .
if that decline continues , it will inevitably reduce the pace of consumer spending .
earlier this year , economic fore@@ ca@@ sters were predicting that annual gdp growth would reach 3 % or more in the second half of 2010 .
now those projections have been cut to less than 2 % , which is too slow to make a dent in the very high rate of unemployment .
the fore@@ ca@@ sters have now shifted their predictions of 3 % -@@ plus growth to 2011 .
let ’ s hope that they are right this time .
why host the world cup ?
nor@@ th@@ am@@ p@@ ton , massachusetts – whom would you trust more , russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin or chicago mayor ra@@ hm e@@ manuel ?
whereas pu@@ tin is revel@@ ing in the attention that russia is receiving as host of the 20@@ 18 world cup , e@@ manuel has informed the us soccer feder@@ ation and fif@@ a that chicago has no interest in serving as a host city when the event comes to north america in 20@@ 26 .
canada and mexico will each host ten matches , and the united states will host another 60 . so why is the third-@@ largest us city taking a pass ?
to understand what it means to host a global sporting event , consider the fact that pu@@ tin ’ s government spent $ 5@@ 1-@@ 70 billion to stage the 20@@ 14 winter olympics in so@@ chi , and is projected to spend at least $ 14 billion ho@@ sting the current world cup , which runs through july 15 .
russia ’ s budget provided for the construction of seven new stadi@@ ums – including one in st. peter@@ sburg that cost around $ 1.@@ 7 billion – and reno@@ vations to five other ven@@ ues .
and that does not even account for the additional expen@@ ses for training facilities , lo@@ d@@ ging , expanded infrastructure , and security .
chicago , having already ho@@ sted the opening ceremony and first match of the 1994 world cup , has adopted quite a different mindset .
e@@ manuel ’ s spo@@ kes@@ person , matt mc@@ gr@@ ath , recently issued a statement explaining that , “ fif@@ a could not provide a basic level of certainty on some major un@@ know@@ ns that put our city and taxpa@@ yers at risk . ” fif@@ a , mc@@ gr@@ ath alle@@ ges , was demanding something t@@ ant@@ amount to a “ blank check , ” including an “ open-@@ ended ability to modi@@ fy the agreement … at any time and at their discre@@ tion . ”
moreover , fif@@ a would have required that soldier field – home to the chicago bears football team – be taken out of use for two months prior to the tour@@ nam@@ ent .
in the end , e@@ manuel ’ s office concluded that , “ the uncertainty for taxpa@@ yers , coupled with fif@@ a ’ s in@@ flexibility and un@@ willingness to negotiate , were clear indi@@ cations that further pursuit of the bid wasn ’ t in chicago ’ s best interests . ”
in addition to holding anywhere from two to six games – potentially over the course of a number of weeks – world cup host cities are expected to throw a “ fan fest , ” fur@@ nish training facilities for the teams , and provide extensive tax ex@@ emp@@ tions for a range of activities .
in fact , fif@@ a prohi@@ bits both direct and indi@@ rect tax@@ ation on all income from the event , ex@@ emp@@ ting contin@@ ental soccer con@@ feder@@ ations , ho@@ st-@@ country broad@@ ca@@ sters , and fif@@ a member associ@@ ations , service providers , and contra@@ ctors .
it is little wonder , then , that min@@ ne@@ a@@ polis and vancouver have joined chicago in declining the ho@@ sting honor .
to justify its imperi@@ ous behavior , fif@@ a points out that , “ &#91; the &#93; world cup is a major sporting event that attra@@ cts global attention to the host country / host countries and provides the opportunity for significant financial investment in sporting and public infrastructure . ” and that added attention and investment , fif@@ a claims , “ may contribute to significant mid- and long-term soci@@ o@@ economic benefits … as well as economic growth . ”
but note the carefully qualified language .
fif@@ a only goes so far as to promise an “ opportunity for significant financial investment ” in infrastructure , as well as attention and investment that “ may contribute ” to growth .
in reality , schol@@ arly evidence shows that the world cup rarely benefits host countries and cities as much as fif@@ a would like the public , and public officials , to think .
for example , consider what russia gets in exchange for its $ 14 billion-@@ plus investment in this year ’ s event .
while all of the revenue from ticket sales , international broadcasting rights , and sponsor@@ ships will go directly to fif@@ a , russia will be left with seven new stadi@@ ums and five re@@ fur@@ bis@@ hed facilities that it does not need .
and unless it demo@@ li@@ shes these ven@@ ues , it will have to spend tens of millions of dollars every year to maintain them .
to be sure , images of sle@@ ek new facilities are being dissemin@@ ated worldwide .
but the optics are not necessarily working in russia ’ s favor .
apparently , there was no hiding the 6,000 empty seats at the uru@@ gu@@ a@@ y-@@ egypt match on june 15 .
if history is any guide , it is highly unlikely that the 20@@ 18 world cup will increase russia ’ s international investment or trade , boost its tourism industry , or streng@@ then its people ’ s commitment to physical fitness .
what it will do is in@@ still a fle@@ eting sense of national pride among a significant portion of russians , while offering an ep@@ he@@ mer@@ al distra@@ ction from the country ’ s moun@@ ting problems .
with or without the world cup , o@@ il-@@ price vola@@ tili@@ ty and international san@@ ctions imposed in response to pu@@ tin ’ s 20@@ 14 an@@ nex@@ ation of cri@@ me@@ a will continue to dar@@ ken russia ’ s economic pro@@ spe@@ cts and dimin@@ ish ordinary russians ’ standard of living .
so , whom should you trust ?
i ’ m going with e@@ manuel .
why i am challenging pu@@ tin
russia is living through the deepest , most pro@@ lon@@ ged crisis in modern history .
it is a man-made crisis that has struck every sphere of society and the state .
this crisis is not a natural disaster but one engineered by the choice of a false doctrine of reform , one that is leading the country to degradation .
few people believe in the pu@@ tin regime &apos;s ability to achieve serious change .
the corruption and in@@ efficiency of the state apparatus and the government &apos;s in@@ compe@@ tence and iner@@ tia leave no hope for a real improvement in living standards .
instead of the state being streng@@ th@@ ened , it is being re@@ born as a poli@@ ce-@@ bureau@@ cratic apparatus to suppress social protest , ex@@ t@@ ort bribes , and assure political repres@@ sion .
i am running for president in order to clean@@ se the state apparatus of corruption and bureau@@ cratic arbit@@ rar@@ iness and to su@@ mm@@ on competent and responsible people into state service .
russia cannot with@@ stand another four years of pl@@ under and destruction .
i am running so as to implement a real program to rebuild the economy .
the current regime will not implement such a program and will continue to serve the oli@@ g@@ arch@@ ic c@@ lan@@ s that have grown fat by pl@@ under@@ ing state property .
pu@@ tin &apos;s corrupt and ir@@ responsible regime has become part of the system of oli@@ g@@ arch@@ ic parasi@@ tism , with its path@@ ologically un@@ just distribution of incomes and property .
the current regime is ignor@@ ing an im@@ mu@@ table law of governance : a state &apos;s effectiveness is indi@@ visible from its responsibility for social justice .
by aband@@ oning this responsibility , today &apos;s state has become not only in@@ effective but dangerous .
the im@@ pover@@ ishment of great masses of the population has destroyed the structures of civil society , giving rise to a &quot; civilization of slums . &quot;
roughly half of russia &apos;s population , primarily children , is not getting enough to eat .
child negle@@ ct and hom@@ eless@@ ness are growing .
towns and villages are sw@@ am@@ ped by violence and ban@@ di@@ try .
poverty , psychological stress , and the collapse of health care have led to an anom@@ al@@ ously high death rate , a mass decrease in health , and the wasting of colo@@ s@@ sal labor resources .
many people cannot buy the most basic medicines and have no access to modern medical services .
the pro@@ spe@@ cts for moderni@@ zing or even preserving the national health care system are shrinking with every year .
i am running in the election in order to guarantee everyone living in our country , which is the richest in the world , the constitu@@ tional right to a decent life and to develop freely .
in order to do this , we must take back as state revenue the profits from the exploitation of our natural wealth , double the budget , and guarantee everyone &apos;s real right to free education and healthcare .
the &quot; reforms &quot; that have been conducted over the last 15 years have denied a large proportion of the wor@@ k-@@ fit population , primarily young people , of jobs and the right to a decent life .
but they are the back@@ bone of our country .
continuing on the current path will only destroy the nation &apos;s workers .
imple@@ menting our program of social justice and economic growth will allow wages to be doubled in the course of a year by bringing them into line with labor &apos;s contribution to the national income , expanding workers &apos; rights to stand up for their interests , and increasing the minimum wage by three times .
real wages should grow four@@ fold by 2010 ; pen@@ sions must also grow accor@@ d@@ ingly .
economic growth must en@@ compass all regions of the country , and people must have equal social guarante@@ es , rights , and opportunities regardless of their place of residen@@ ce .
at the moment , revenues are diver@@ ted away from the regions to the center and then dis@@ pat@@ ched abroad ­ - the oli@@ g@@ arch@@ s &apos; wealth of billions comes from fle@@ ec@@ ing the russian provin@@ ces .
i will put an end to this .
to improve the economy we will direct len@@ ding to manufacturing and entrepreneurial activity , protect the right to honestly earned and legally acquired property , rebuild savings , and stimulate scienti@@ fic@@ -@@ technical innovation and investment .
markets will be pur@@ ged of criminals and mono@@ poli@@ es ; honest competition will begin to operate .
those who work well and benefit society will get high incomes , not those who take what belongs to other people .
the prices of basic commodities and charges for electricity , heating , and other vital services will be reduced to their actual production costs .
the geo@@ political legacy of the uss@@ r as a great power has been squ@@ ander@@ ed over the years of &quot; reform . &quot;
reform of the armed services has bo@@ iled down to dis@@ arma@@ ment alone .
combat capability has fallen to an unprecedented low level .
russia is being threatened with losing its status as a power .
russia will not be re@@ born without the re@@ birth of a powerful , modern army .
aff@@ li@@ cted by corruption , the la@@ w-@@ en@@ for@@ cement authorities are not in a position to prevent the threat of terrorism or to cr@@ ush organized crime .
