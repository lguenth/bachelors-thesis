under the slogan of the market , the current regime has allowed de@@ pra@@ vity to flourish on television and in mass culture .
the profound values of russian culture are being systematically destroyed , stri@@ pping life of its meaning and joy , and so@@ wing an en@@ mity of each against all .
to give russians back a feeling of pride in their homeland , and to create the conditions for a revi@@ val of our historical spiritual and cultural traditions , we must revi@@ ve our schools , eradicate the spirit of de@@ pra@@ vity and violence in the media , provide everyone with access to masterpieces of russian culture , and create the conditions for a social partnership between the state and the church .
now is the moment for russians to take russia back !
why india is riski@@ er than china
new haven – today , fears are growing that china and india are about to be the next victims of the ongoing global economic car@@ na@@ ge .
this would have enormous consequences .
asia ’ s developing and newly industrialized economies grew at an 8.@@ 5 % average annual rate over 20@@ 10-@@ 11 – nearly triple the 3 % growth elsewhere in the world .
if china and india are next to fall , asia would be at risk , and it would be hard to avoid a global recession .
in one important sense , these concerns are understandable : both economies depend heavily on the broader global climate .
china is sensitive to down@@ side risks to external demand – more relevant than ever since cris@@ is-@@ torn europe and the united states collectively accoun@@ ted for 38 % of total exports in 2010 .
but india , with its large curr@@ ent-@@ account deficit and external funding needs , is more exposed to tough conditions in global financial markets .
yet fears of hard land@@ ings for both economies are over@@ blown , especially regar@@ ding china .
yes , china is paying a price for aggressive economic stimulus under@@ taken in the depths of the sub@@ prime crisis .
the banking system funded the bulk of the additional spending , and thus is exposed to any de@@ terior@@ ation in credit quality that may have ar@@ isen from such efforts .
there are also concerns about fro@@ thy property markets and moun@@ ting inflation .
while none of these problems should be mini@@ mi@@ zed , they are unlikely to trigger a hard landing . long fix@@ ated on stability , chinese policymakers have been quick to take pre@@ emp@@ tive action .
that is particularly evident in chinese officials ’ successful campaign against inflation .
administra@@ tive measures in the agricultural sector , aimed at alle@@ vi@@ ating supply bottlen@@ ecks for por@@ k , cooking oil , fresh vegetables , and fertilizer , have pushed food-@@ price inflation lower .
this is the main reason why the headline consumer inflation rate re@@ ce@@ ded from 6.@@ 5 % in july 2011 to 4.@@ 2 % in november .
meanwhile , the people ’ s bank of china , which hi@@ ked bench@@ mark one-@@ year len@@ ding rates five times in the 12 months ending this october , to 6.@@ 5 % , now has plenty of scope for mon@@ etary e@@ asing should economic conditions de@@ terior@@ ate .
the same is true with mand@@ atory reserves in the banking sector , where the government has already pr@@ un@@ ed 50 basis points off the record 2@@ 1.5 % requi@@ red-@@ reserve ratio .
relatively small fiscal defic@@ its – only around 2 % of gdp in 2010 – leave china with an added dimension of policy flexibility should circumstances dic@@ tate .
nor has china been passive with respect to moun@@ ting specu@@ lative ex@@ cess@@ es in residential property .
in april 2010 , it implemented tough new regulations , raising down-@@ payments from 20 % to 30 % for a first home , to 50 % for a second residen@@ ce , and to 100 % for purch@@ ases of three or more units .
this strategy appears to be working .
in november , house prices declined in 49 of the 70 cities that china monit@@ ors monthly .
moreover , it is a serious exagger@@ ation to claim , as many do today , that the chinese economy is one massive real-@@ estate bubble .
yes , total fixed investment is approaching an unprecedented 50 % of gdp , but residential and non@@ residential real estate , combined , accounts for only 15-@@ 20 % of that – no more than 10 % of the overall economy .
in terms of floor space , residential construction accounts for half of china ’ s real-@@ estate investment .
identi@@ fying the share of residential real estate that goes to private developers in the dozen or so first-@@ tier cities ( which account for most of the chinese property market ’ s fi@@ zz ) suggests that less than 1 % of gdp would be at risk in the event of a hous@@ ing-@@ market collapse – not exactly a recipe for a hard landing .
as for chinese banks , the main problem appears to be exposure to ballo@@ oning lo@@ cal@@ -@@ government debt , which , according to the government , tot@@ aled $ 1.@@ 7 trillion ( roughly 30 % of gdp ) at the end of 2010 .
approximately half of this debt was on their books prior to the crisis .
some of the new debt that resulted from the stimulus could well end up being impaired , but ongoing urbanization – around 15-@@ 20 million people per year move to cities – provides enormous support on the demand side for investment in infrastructure development and residential and commercial construction .
that temper@@ s the risks to credit quality and , along with relatively low lo@@ an-@@ to-@@ depos@@ it rati@@ os of around 65 % , should cus@@ hi@@ on the chinese banking system .
india is more problematic .
as the only economy in asia with a curr@@ ent-@@ account deficit , its external funding problems can hardly be taken ligh@@ tly .
like china , india ’ s econom@@ ic@@ -@@ growth momentum is eb@@ bing .
but unlike china , the down@@ shift is more pronoun@@ ced – gdp growth fell through the 7 % threshold in the third cal@@ en@@ dar@@ -@@ year quarter of 2011 , and annual industrial output actually fell by 5.@@ 1 % in october .
but the real problem is that , in contrast to china , indian authorities have far less policy le@@ e@@ way .
for star@@ ters , the rupe@@ e is in near free-@@ fall .
that means that the reserve bank of india – which has hi@@ ked its bench@@ mark policy rate 13 times since the start of 2010 to deal with a still@@ -@@ serious inflation problem – can ill afford to ease mon@@ etary policy .
moreover , an out@@ size con@@ soli@@ dated government budget deficit of around 9 % of gdp limits india ’ s fis@@ cal@@ -@@ policy discre@@ tion .
while china is in better shape than india , neither economy is likely to im@@ plo@@ de on its own .
it would take another shock to trigger a hard landing in asia .
one obvious possibility today would be a disruptive break@@ up of the european mon@@ etary union .
in that case , both china and india , like most of the world ’ s economies , could find themselves in serious difficulty – with an ou@@ tri@@ ght contra@@ ction of chinese exports , as in late 2008 and early 2009 , and hei@@ ghten@@ ed external funding pressures for india .
while i remain a euro@@ -@@ skeptic , i believe that the political will to advance european integration will pre@@ va@@ il .
con@@ sequ@@ ently , i attach a low probability to the currency union ’ s dis@@ integration .
bar@@ ring such a wor@@ st-@@ case outcome for europe , the odds of a hard landing in either india or china should remain low .
se@@ duced by the political economy of false prosperity , the west has squ@@ ander@@ ed its might .
driven by strategy and stability , asia has built on its new@@ found strength .
but now it must reinvent itself .
japan@@ es@@ e-@@ like stag@@ nation in the developed world is challenging extern@@ ally dependent asia to shift its focus to internal demand .
down@@ side pressures currently squee@@ zing china and india under@@ score that challenge .
asia ’ s defining moment could be hand .
why i published &apos; the ti@@ an@@ an@@ men pa@@ pers@@ &apos;
the chinese leadership ’ s pen@@ chant for secre@@ tiveness is pro@@ ver@@ bial .
but the veil that exists over how that om@@ ni@@ potent party makes important decisions is being lifted somewhat because a volume of unique materials about the be@@ hin@@ d-@@ the-@@ scenes events surrounding the in@@ famous ti@@ an@@ an@@ men mas@@ sac@@ re of 1989 is being published this month .
taken as a whole , these documents provide a rare glimpse into the modus oper@@ and@@ i of china ’ s leaders .
as a witness and participant in the ti@@ an@@ an@@ men events , and as someone with access to the historical archive , i felt it my duty to publish this record of the decisions that lay behind what happened .
the real truth of what happened in l@@ 9@@ 89 was locked in secret party archives in beijing for over a decade .
i chose to involve myself in this personally risky project because i believe those who wish to serve china must reflect deeply on the lessons of the ti@@ an@@ an@@ men events .
despite under@@ going great changes in the years since 1989 , china needs not only to reverse the verdi@@ ct on the june 4@@ th movement as &quot; a counter-@@ revolutionary rebellion , &quot; but also to re@@ start its st@@ alled process of political reform and democra@@ tization .
although the mas@@ sac@@ re in ti@@ an@@ an@@ men square of june 4 , 1989 happened over ten years ago , it has not fa@@ ded from people &apos;s memories .
chinese history seems frozen at that date .
far too many questions about those events remain un@@ answered .
the first step in achieving an accurate , complete , and objective re-@@ evaluation of what happened must involve , as deng xia@@ oping famously said , a &quot; search for truth in facts . &quot;
only then can the true face of history be restored .
i believe that the following four lessons should guide those who are working for change in china and have motivated my actions in this case .
first , even though the chinese communist regime has become thorough@@ ly corrupt , it has streng@@ th@@ ened itself through economic growth and improvement in people &apos;s lives .
these achievements have enabled it to intensi@@ fy its organi@@ zational penet@@ ration into almost every corner of society .
no political force in china can stand up to it .
people who do not like what the party does must realize that they have nowhere else to turn ; they can rely only on themselves .
even though the end of communism in china may seem a for@@ eg@@ one conclusion , the fall of the chinese communist party will be accomplished not by an outside force but only by its own members .
second , given the lock that the communist party holds on all the levers of power , the building of democracy in china depends on forces rooted inside china .
those who have worked overseas for democracy , freedom , and the rule of law and who have sought the support of the international community have done necessary work .
but real solutions to china &apos;s problems must be sought at home .
third , change from inside is possible because the chinese communist party today resem@@ bles the communist party of the soviet union around 1989 .
what looks on the outside like a solid structure can break into pieces overnight .
the chinese communist party has long since ceased to be a traditional communist party .
it is now a m@@ é@@ lange of fac@@ tions with diverse goals and differ@@ ing ide@@ ologies .
the differences between radi@@ cals and conservatives in the party are now shar@@ per than those between the party and its historic ri@@ val , the ku@@ omin@@ tan@@ g .
the key force pushing for political change is the pro-@@ democracy faction within the party .
so what will replace the chinese communist party will probably be a new force that emerges from inside the party ; a group that regrets the errors of the communist system , a group committed to establi@@ shing a healthy democracy .
this group will unite with forces of democra@@ tization both at home and abroad to establish a truly democratic system .
fourth , rever@@ sal of the verdi@@ ct on june 4@@ th is an historical inevi@@ tability , as well as the wish of most of china ’ s people .
june 4@@ th weighs on the spirits of every chinese patriot ; almost every chinese person knows that official re@@ evaluation is just a matter of time .
indeed , the party &apos;s top leadership has been divided about the event ever since it occurred .
today , many of those responsible for the decision to crack down - not@@ ably deng xia@@ oping and others of the party elders – have died .
so calls to reverse the verdi@@ ct are growing , both inside and outside the party .
these calls will eventually form the mainstream , and the liberal forces within the party will und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly respond by sei@@ zing a historic opportunity not only to reverse the verdi@@ ct but to move toward dis@@ car@@ ding the communist system .
chinese democracy still has a long , hard road before it .
among other things , it needs a class of well-@@ educated activists it lost when many young people left china to study and build a better life elsewhere .
even if risk and a large degree of self-@@ sacrifice are required , these young people should return to join those in china , including those within the communist party , that are working for change .
as l@@ u x@@ un said , &quot; a true warrior dar@@ es to stare the sadness of life in the face and to see the blood that dri@@ ps there . &quot;
why is america ’ s budget deficit so large ?
cambridge – america ’ s enormous budget deficit is now exce@@ eded as a share of national income only by greece and egypt among all of the world ’ s major countries .
to be sure , the current deficit of 9.@@ 1 % of gdp is due in part to the automatic effects of the recession .
but , according to the official projections of the united states con@@ gressi@@ onal budget office ( c@@ bo ) , even after the economy returns to full employment , the deficit will remain so large that america ’ s national deb@@ t-@@ to-@@ gdp ratio will continue to rise for the rest of this decade and beyond .
understanding how to achieve us fiscal con@@ soli@@ dation requires understanding why the budget deficit is projected to remain so high .
before looking at the projected future defic@@ its , consider what happened in the first two years of president barack obama ’ s administration that caused the deficit to rise from 3.@@ 2 % of gdp in 2008 to 8.@@ 9 % of gdp in 2010 ( which in turn pushed up the national deb@@ t-@@ to-@@ gdp ratio from 40 % to 62 % ) .
the 5.@@ 7 % -@@ of-@@ gdp rise in the budget deficit reflected a 2.@@ 6 % -@@ of-@@ gdp fall in tax revenues ( from 17@@ .@@ 5 % to 14@@ .@@ 9 % of gdp ) and 3.@@ 1 % -@@ of-@@ gdp rise in out@@ lays ( from 20@@ .7 % to 2@@ 3.@@ 8 % of gdp ) .
according to the c@@ bo , less than half of the 5.@@ 7 % -@@ of-@@ gdp increase in the budget deficit was the result of the economic down@@ turn , as the automatic stabili@@ zers added 2.5 % of gdp to the rise in the deficit between 2008 and 2010 .
the c@@ bo analysis calls the changes in the budget deficit induced by cycli@@ cal conditions “ automatic stabili@@ zers , ” on the theory that the revenue decline and expen@@ di@@ ture increase ( mainly for unemployment benefits and other transfer payments ) caused by an economic down@@ turn contribute to aggregate demand and thus help to stabilize the economy .
in other words , even without the automatic stabili@@ zers – that is , if the economy had been at full employment in 200@@ 8-@@ 2010 – the us budget deficit still would have increased by 3.@@ 2 % of gdp .
lower revenue and increased out@@ lays each account for about half of this “ full-@@ employment ” rise in the deficit .
looking ahead , the c@@ bo projects that en@@ acting the budget proposed by the obama administration in february would add $ 3.@@ 8 trillion to the national debt between 2010 and 2020 , causing the deb@@ t-@@ to-@@ gdp ratio to so@@ ar from 62 % to 90 % .
that $ 3.@@ 8 trillion net debt increase reflects a roughly $ 5 trillion increase in the deficit , o@@ wing to higher spending and weaker revenues from midd@@ le@@ - and lower@@ -@@ income taxpa@@ yers , off@@ set in part by $ 1.3 trillion in tax increases , primarily on high-@@ income ear@@ ners .
even this enormous increase in the projected defic@@ its and debt under@@ estimates the fiscal damage that the obama administration ’ s budget , if en@@ acted , would in@@ fli@@ ct .
the annual level of defense spending is projected to decline by about $ 50 billion in each year after 2012 – a very optimistic view of us military needs in the decade ahead .
shrinking america ’ s budget deficit to prevent a further rise in the deb@@ t-@@ to-@@ gdp ratio from its current level will require reduced spending and increased revenue .
that increase in revenue can be achieved without raising margin@@ al tax rates , namely by limit@@ ing the amount of tax reduction that individuals and businesses can achieve from the various “ tax expen@@ di@@ tures ” that form an important part of the us tax code .
but that is a subject for another column .
on the expen@@ di@@ ture side , however , the prospect that the national debt could double during the next decade is just the start of the fiscal problem that the us now faces .
the budget out@@ look in subsequ@@ ent decades is dominated by the increasing costs of social security and medicare benefits , which are projected to take the deb@@ t-@@ to-@@ gdp ratio from 90 % in 2020 to 19@@ 0 % in 20@@ 35 .
fundamental reform of these programs is the primary challenge for america ’ s public finan@@ ces – and thus for the long-term health of the us economy .
why is china boom@@ ing ?
provi@@ dence , r.@@ i. – china is now celebrating the 30@@ th anniversary of the period officially known as “ reform and opening . ”
lab@@ eling time in this way echo@@ es china ’ s imperial history .
during moments of political transition – a military victory , for example – the emper@@ or might desig@@ nate a special “ era name ” to help celebrate the good news .
or the court might test out a new era name after a political de@@ bac@@ le , in an effort to wipe the slate clean .
the last emper@@ or of the tan@@ g dy@@ nasty pro@@ cla@@ imed seven era names in four@@ teen years , as he sought in va@@ in to “ re-@@ brand ” his rei@@ g@@ n and avoid his regime ’ s de@@ mise .
deng xia@@ oping began to champion “ reform and opening ” in 1978 . “ reform ” suggested a loo@@ sen@@ ing of central controls on economic life , under@@ taken in a spirit of prag@@ mati@@ sm and gradu@@ alism , as an antidote to mao ze@@ d@@ ong ’ s ideology of “ revolution . ”
similarly , “ opening ” her@@ al@@ ded the pr@@ c ’ s integration into the world community – especially the capit@@ alist west .
deng ’ s principles still guide policy today .
one must go back to the q@@ ing dy@@ nasty ( 16@@ 4@@ 4-@@ 19@@ 12 ) and its 60-@@ year era of “ hea@@ ven@@ ly flourishing ” ( q@@ i@@ an@@ long ) in the eigh@@ te@@ enth century to find a comparable period of coherent political and economic policy .
the era of “ reform and opening ” has out@@ lived its “ emper@@ or ” by more than a decade , and has been the common thread running through transfers of political authority from deng to ji@@ ang z@@ em@@ in and hu j@@ inta@@ o .
even the largest popular challenge the chinese communist party ever faced , the demon@@ strations of 1989 , now looks like a bli@@ p that helped deng con@@ soli@@ date support for his model of development .
if one factor under@@ gir@@ ds china ’ s commitment to “ reform and opening , ” it is the extraordinary macro@@ economic changes of the past 30 years .
in china , people call it fa@@ z@@ han , or “ development , ” but in much of rest of the world , it is more commonly described simply as the “ china boom , ” or the “ china miracle . ”
the boom began in the countryside in the late 1970 ’ s and 1980 ’ s , and was followed by today ’ s urban , industri@@ al-@@ led growth .
indeed , there have been many smaller “ booms ” – in consumption , foreign direct investment , domestic stock markets , trade , travel , overseas study , military moderni@@ zation , and international diplomacy .
there is also a boom in pollution and toxic waste , and boom@@ ing interest in religion – from buddh@@ ism to pent@@ eco@@ st@@ al christi@@ an@@ ity – and in con@@ fu@@ cian philosophy .
little in china today speaks of moder@@ ation .
a leading fashion industry executive argues that a key engine driving the economic boom has been the influ@@ x of women into the workforce , particularly in the manufacturing zones of the south .
another compelling explanation comes from a venture capit@@ alist who credi@@ ts chinese society with cop@@ i@@ ous reserves of entrepreneurial energy that deri@@ ves , he believes , from the fact that chinese culture atta@@ ches very little shame to failing in a business enterprise .
whatever the cause , the boom seems an unlikely cap@@ stone to a century of war , fer@@ ment , and revolution , and only adds to the sense of dis@@ continuity that characteri@@ zes modern china .
certainly , few obser@@ vers looking in 1978 at the sm@@ ol@@ dering em@@ bers of the cultural revolution , or at the seem@@ ing ru@@ ination of the post-@@ 1989 years , thought china would emerge as the lightning rod of the world ’ s developmental hopes .
paradox@@ ically , the apparently dis@@ continuous and contradi@@ c@@ tory nature of the “ era of reform and opening ” may actually help explain how china ’ s boom came about .
the tu@@ mul@@ t of the ma@@ o@@ ist period inst@@ illed in a broad cross-@@ section of people a profound appreciation for stability , and a year@@ ning to be left alone .
deng capit@@ alized on this revolution@@ -@@ we@@ ar@@ iness by dimin@@ ishing the role of politics and the state in people ’ s private lives and fre@@ eing them to release their pent@@ -up energy to pursue their own goals .
revolutionary communism may well have clear@@ ed the path for the boom in other ways as well , suggesting that the shift from soci@@ alist utop@@ i@@ an@@ ism to capit@@ alist prag@@ mati@@ sm was less a u-@@ turn than a sequ@@ ential process of “ creative destruction . ”
after all , mao ’ s cultural revolution against “ feu@@ dal society ” did ra@@ ze much of the cultural landscape , den@@ u@@ ding it not only of traditional values and institutions , but also of failed soci@@ alist efforts , leaving china ready for the seeds of capit@@ alist development .
mao ’ s revolution fu@@ eled countless rec@@ tification movements and campaigns that inver@@ ted the on@@ ce-@@ in@@ viol@@ ate pri@@ macy of rul@@ er over ruled , scholar over worker , husband over wife , father over son , and family over individual .
by the time of the reforms of the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s , bonds tying individuals to culture , the state , the work unit , and house@@ hol@@ d-@@ regi@@ stration systems , for example , had largely un@@ ra@@ vel@@ ed .
the path had been clear@@ ed for a vast new population of atom@@ ized entrepreneurs and labor@@ ers , fre@@ ed from fe@@ alty to family and party , to storm the marketplace with newly liber@@ ated individual energy .
of course , the boom ’ s costs should not be dis@@ counted .
environmental damage has been staggering , the gap between rich and poor has been growing , and urbanization – with all its atten@@ dant problems – has sur@@ ged .
and , at least so far , the boom has not induced the systemic political changes for which many hoped .
but still , a key question remains un@@ answered : why did china ’ s boom happen ?
this is one of the great questions of our time , relevant not only to china ’ s future , but to scores of other developing countries en@@ thr@@ alled by china ’ s extraordinary , but still largely un@@ explained , success .
why is france burning ?
the urban dist@@ urban@@ ces in france have been called the most severe since the riots by students and workers in 1968 .
the analogy is mis@@ leading .
while the 1968 prote@@ sts challenged the french republican model to live up to its fin@@ est aspirations , today ’ s crisis challenges the french revolution ’ s model of citizenship and integration itself .
the french republican model asser@@ ts that all french citizens have the same cultural identity . indeed , this is the only acceptable identity .
to achieve this shared identity , all citizens have to speak the one official language and be educated according to a common curriculum .
all this is not only fo@@ stered by the state , but also requires the kind of uni@@ form@@ ity that only a centralized state can impose .
indeed , the french revolution ’ s ideological commitment to unity was so strong that during parts of the n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth century , advoc@@ ating feder@@ alism was a capital offen@@ se .
three components of this model inc@@ ited today ’ s crisis and make it difficult for the french republic to address it effectively .
the first component is the classic french republican prohi@@ bi@@ tion on gathering data in the official census – or by government agencies or public or private enter@@ pris@@ es – on ethni@@ city , religion , and even social class .
collecting these data would , it is argued , viol@@ ate the republican ten@@ et that france is “ one and indi@@ visible . ”
but the absence of a secondary breakdown of such data , like the u@@ k-@@ style , four-@@ fold class analysis ( plus exam@@ ination of patterns of unemployment by ethni@@ city or religion ) , makes it hard for social workers , public he@@ ath officials , and economic planners to diagnose new problems .
without the necessary data for analysis , public health policies , for example , cannot be directed toward groups that are especially dis@@ advanta@@ ged or otherwise at risk .
like the prohi@@ bi@@ tion of fine-@@ tuned data – without which positive discrimin@@ ation is in any case impossible – affir@@ ma@@ tive action is seen as dama@@ ging to the republican model because it is based on recognition of ethnic differences .
the third component is the post-@@ welfare state , which is now part of the french model of citizenship and guarante@@ es all full-time employees one of the highest minimum wages in the world and high emplo@@ y@@ er-@@ paid benefits .
this makes it extremely difficult to let workers go , which makes emplo@@ yers reluctant to hire new people in the first place .
many of the soci@@ al-@@ democratic countries of europe , like sweden , holland , and denmark , created similar norms in their full-@@ employment er@@ as .
unlike france , however , they also used census data to identify pockets of new unemployment , and to invest socially and politically , not only in excellent job@@ -@@ training programs , but in job creation , and , just as importantly , in job@@ -@@ placement sch@@ emes .
france is now very bad at creating new jobs .
it has few training programs , but high benefits for the unemployed and strong restri@@ ctions against firing workers .
put all of this together , and it is like slam@@ ming a door in the face of young minority men looking for work .
this is the primary cause of the 30-@@ 50 % unemployment rates among min@@ orities aged 16-@@ 24 in many french “ urban zones of sensitivity . ”
thus , the riots that france is now seeing emerge from french policies , not from inst@@ ig@@ ations by islam@@ ists .
but few political leaders accept that the crisis has anything to do with the french model of citizenship .
indeed , they confi@@ dently wait for as@@ simil@@ ation to kick in .
but in today ’ s high unemployment , low job@@ -@@ creation , and now mul@@ ticul@@ tural france , as@@ simil@@ ation will not occur without big changes .
france is only now beginning to come to gri@@ ps with the crisis of its republican model of equal citizenship .
a newly created minister of social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on has begun to commission studies documenting discrimin@@ ation .
one study showed that for similarly qualified job appli@@ can@@ ts , those with an islam@@ ic@@ -@@ so@@ unding name , and an address in an ethni@@ cally seg@@ mented subur@@ b , had only one-@@ fifth the chance of even getting an interview as people with a fren@@ ch-@@ so@@ unding name and a “ safe ” address .
two hundred and fifty of the largest private and public enter@@ pris@@ es have created an organization aimed at working with the government to allow them , for the first time ever , to document , and then red@@ ress , their discrimin@@ atory employment practices .
fortunately , organized muslim leaders so far have not ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ated the ri@@ oting .
of course , the government ’ s reduction of community policing in favor of param@@ ili@@ tary forces sta@@ tioned in qu@@ asi@@ -@@ military bar@@ ra@@ cks , and the minister of interior ’ s description of the young ri@@ ot@@ ers as “ sc@@ um ” who should be washed away with an industrial power hose , has not helped .
the french republican model ens@@ hr@@ ines the lau@@ dable abstract principles of liberty , equality , and fr@@ ater@@ nity .
however , so long as secon@@ d@@ - and third-@@ generation minority citizens are taught that the only acceptable cultural identity is french , but are not in fact accepted as french – indeed , are blocked from enjoying the full rights of french citizenship – the republican model will fuel ali@@ en@@ ation rather than democratic integration .
new york – deadly terrorist attacks in istanbul , d@@ ha@@ ka , and bag@@ h@@ dad demonstrate the mur@@ der@@ ous reach of the islamic state ( isis ) in europe , north africa , the middle east , and parts of asia .
the longer isis main@@ tains its stron@@ gh@@ olds in syria and iraq , the longer its terrorist network will create such car@@ na@@ ge .
yet isis is not especially difficult to defeat .
the problem is that none of the states involved in iraq and syria , including the united states and its allies , has so far treated isis as its primary fo@@ e .
it ’ s time they do .
isis has a small fighting force , which the us puts at 20,000 to 25,000 in iraq and syria , and another 5,000 or so in libya .
compared to the number of active military personnel in syria ( 12@@ 5,000 ) , iraq ( 2@@ 7@@ 1,500 ) , saudi arabia ( 23@@ 3,@@ 500 ) , turkey ( 5@@ 10@@ ,@@ 600 ) , or iran ( 5@@ 2@@ 3,000 ) , isis is min@@ us@@ cule .
despite us president barack obama ’ s ple@@ dge in september 20@@ 14 to “ degrade and ultimately destroy ” isis , the us and its allies , including saudi arabia , turkey , and israel ( behind the scenes ) , have been focusing instead on top@@ pling syria ’ s bas@@ har al-@@ as@@ sad .
israel op@@ poses isis , but israel ’ s greater concern is as@@ sad ’ s iranian bac@@ king .
as@@ sad enables iran to support two param@@ ili@@ tary fo@@ es of israel , he@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h and hamas .
israel therefore priori@@ ti@@ zes the re@@ mov@@ al of as@@ sad over the defeat of isis .
for the us , ste@@ ered by neo@@ conservatives , the war in syria is a continu@@ ation of the plan for global us he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y launched by defense secretary richard chen@@ ey and under secretary paul wol@@ fo@@ witz at the cold war ’ s end .
in 1991 , wol@@ fo@@ witz told us general wes@@ ley clark :
“ but one thing we did learn &#91; from the persi@@ an gulf war &#93; is that we can use our military in the region – in the middle east – and the so@@ vie@@ ts won ’ t stop us .
and we ’ ve got about 5 or 10 years to clean up those old soviet regimes – syria , iran ( sic ) , iraq – before the next great superpower comes on to challenge us . ”
the multiple us wars in the middle east – afghanistan , iraq , syria , libya , and others – have sought to remove the soviet union , and then russia , from the scene and to give the us he@@ ge@@ mon@@ ic s@@ way .
these efforts have failed miser@@ ably .
for saudi arabia , as for israel , the main goal is to ou@@ st as@@ sad in order to wea@@ ken iran .
syria is part of the extensive pro@@ xy war between shi@@ a iran and sun@@ ni saudi arabia that plays out in the battle@@ fields of syria and yemen and in bitter shi@@ a-@@ sun@@ ni confron@@ tations in ba@@ h@@ rain and other divided countries in the region ( including saudi arabia itself ) .
for turkey , the over@@ throw of as@@ sad would bol@@ ster its regional standing .
yet turkey now faces three fo@@ es on its southern border : as@@ sad , isis , and nation@@ alist kur@@ ds .
isis has so far taken a back seat to turkey ’ s concerns about as@@ sad and the kur@@ ds .
but is@@ is-@@ directed terrorist attacks in turkey may be changing that .
russia and iran , too , have pursu@@ ed their own regional interests , including through pro@@ xy wars and support for param@@ ili@@ tary operations .
yet both have sign@@ aled their read@@ iness to cooperate with the us to defeat isis , and perhaps to solve other problems as well .
the us has so far spur@@ ned these offers , because of its focus on top@@ pling as@@ sad .
the us foreig@@ n-@@ policy establishment bl@@ ames russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin for defending as@@ sad , while russia bl@@ ames the us for trying to over@@ throw him .
these compla@@ ints might seem symmetrical , but they ’ re not .
the attempt by the us and its allies to over@@ throw as@@ sad viol@@ ates the un charter , while russia ’ s support of as@@ sad is consistent with syria ’ s right of self-@@ defense under that charter .
yes , as@@ sad is a des@@ pot , but the un charter does not give license to any country to choose which des@@ pots to de@@ pose .
the persi@@ stence of isis under@@ scores three strategic flaws in us foreign policy , along with a fatal tac@@ tical fla@@ w .
first , the ne@@ oc@@ on quest for us he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y through regime change is not only blood@@ y-@@ minded arrogan@@ ce ; it is classic imperial over@@ reach .
it has failed everywhere the us has tried it .
syria and libya are the latest examples .
second , the cia has long armed and trained sun@@ ni ji@@ ha@@ di@@ sts through cover@@ t operations funded by saudi arabia .
in turn , these ji@@ ha@@ di@@ sts gave birth to isis , which is a direct , if un@@ anticipated , consequence of the policies pursu@@ ed by the cia and its saudi partners .
third , the us perception of iran and russia as im@@ plac@@ able fo@@ es of america is in many ways out@@ dated and a self-@@ fulfilling prophe@@ cy . a rap@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement with both countries is possible .
fourth , on the tac@@ tical side , the us attempt to fight a two-@@ front war against both as@@ sad and isis has failed .
whenever as@@ sad has been weak@@ ened , sun@@ ni ji@@ ha@@ di@@ sts , including isis and al-@@ n@@ us@@ ra front , have filled the vacuum .
as@@ sad and his ira@@ qi counter@@ parts can defeat isis if the us , russia , saudi arabia , and iran provide air cover and logi@@ stical support .
yes , as@@ sad would remain in power ; yes , russia would retain an ally in syria ; and yes , iran would have influence there .
terrorist attacks would no doubt continue , perhaps even in the name of isis for a while ; but the group would be denied its base of operations in syria and iraq .
such an outcome would not only end isis on the ground in the middle east ; it could lay the ground@@ work for reducing regional ten@@ sions more generally .
the us and russia could begin to reverse their recent new cold war through shared efforts to stamp out ji@@ ha@@ d@@ ist terrorism .
( a ple@@ dge that nato will not offer ad@@ mission to ukra@@ ine or escal@@ ate missile defen@@ ses in eastern europe would also help . )
there ’ s more .
a cooperative approach to defe@@ ating isis would give saudi arabia and turkey reason and opportunity to find a new modus vi@@ ven@@ di with iran .
israel ’ s security could be enhanced by bringing iran into a cooperative economic and geo@@ political relationship with the west , in turn enhan@@ cing the chances for a long-@@ over@@ due two-@@ state settlement with palestine .
the rise of isis is a symptom of the short@@ com@@ ings of current western – particularly us – strategy .
the west can defeat isis .
the question is whether the us will under@@ take the strategic reas@@ s@@ ess@@ ment needed to accomplish that end .
why is rape different ?
new york – as swedish pro@@ secu@@ tors ’ sex@@ -@@ crime alle@@ ga@@ tions against wikileaks founder julian as@@ san@@ ge play out in the international media , one convention of the coverage mer@@ its serious scru@@ tiny .
we know as@@ san@@ ge by name .
but his acc@@ users – the two swedish women who have brought the compla@@ ints against him – are consistently identified only as “ miss a ” and “ miss w , ” and their images are blur@@ red .
news organizations argue that the policy is motivated by respect for the alle@@ ged victims .
but the same organizations would never report charges of , say , frau@@ d – or , indeed , non-@@ sexual assau@@ lt – against a suspect who has been named on the basis on anonymous acc@@ us@@ ations .
in fact , despite its good intentions , providing anony@@ mity in sex@@ -@@ crime cases is extremely harmful to women .
the convention of not nam@@ ing rape acc@@ users is a reli@@ c of the victor@@ ian period , when rape and other sex crimes were being codi@@ fied and reported in ways that pre@@ figure our own era .
rape was seen as “ the fate worse than death , ” rendering women – who were supposed to be virg@@ ins until marriage – “ damaged goods . ”
virginia wo@@ ol@@ f called the ideal of wom@@ an@@ hood in this period “ the angel in the house ” : a reti@@ ring , fragile creature who could not with@@ stand the ri@@ g@@ ors of the public arena .
of course , this ideal was a double-@@ ed@@ ged s@@ word : their o@@ sten@@ sible fragi@@ lity – and their assigned role as icons of sexual puri@@ ty and ignorance – was used to exclu@@ de women from influ@@ encing outcomes that affected their own dest@@ in@@ ies .
for example , women could not fully participate under their own names in legal proce@@ ed@@ ings .
indeed , one of the rights for which suff@@ ra@@ gi@@ sts fought was the right to be convicted of one ’ s own crimes .
nonetheless , even after women gained legal rights – and even as other assumptions about women have gone the way of sm@@ elling sal@@ ts and wh@@ ale@@ bone stays – the con@@ descen@@ ding victor@@ ian convention of not identi@@ fying women who make sex@@ -@@ crime charges remains with us .
that convention not only is an insu@@ lt to women , but also makes rape pro@@ secu@@ tions far more difficult .
overwhel@@ m@@ ingly , anony@@ mity serves institutions that do not want to pro@@ sec@@ ute rapi@@ sts or sexual har@@ ass@@ ers .
the united states military , for instance , hi@@ des rape acc@@ users ’ identities , and the prevalence of rape in the us armed forces today is off the charts .
maintaining anonymous charges enables the military authorities to avoid keeping comprehensive records , which in turn allows officials to ev@@ ade responsibility for transparent reporting of assau@@ l@@ ts and of pro@@ secu@@ tions – and thus not to pro@@ sec@@ ute sex crime in any serious , systematic way .
the same is true with universities .
my al@@ ma ma@@ ter , yale , used anony@@ mity in reporting of sex har@@ ass@@ ment and rape to swe@@ ep sex@@ -@@ crime inci@@ dents and repeat offen@@ ders ’ records under the ru@@ g for two decades , thereby protecting its own interest in preventing systematic investigation .
because of the prevalence of universities ’ anony@@ mity policy , at least two alle@@ ged serial rapi@@ sts – whose assau@@ l@@ ts were reported to their emplo@@ yers separ@@ ately by more than one victim – are teaching at new universities , with no charges ever brought against them .
the lesson is clear : when charges are made anony@@ mously , no one takes them as seriously as charges brought in public , resul@@ ting in institution@@ alized im@@ pun@@ ity for sexual predators .
indeed , only when victims have stood up and stated their names – granted , a difficult and often painful thing to do – have institutional change and successful pro@@ secu@@ tions been possible .
an@@ ita hill ’ s decision in 1991 not to make anonymous acc@@ us@@ ations against clar@@ ence thomas , now a us supreme court justice , spur@@ red a wave of en@@ for@@ cement of equ@@ al-@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment-@@ opportunity law .
hill knew that her mo@@ tives would be questioned .
but , as a lawyer , she understood how un@@ ethical anonymous alle@@ ga@@ tions are – and how unlikely they are to bring about real consequences .
in fact , the convention of anony@@ mity merely allows rape myths to flourish .
when victims are not kept hidden , it becomes much clear@@ er that rape can happen to anyone – grandmothers and students , home@@ makers and prostit@@ utes .
instead , we have stereotypes about how “ real ” rape victims must look and act in order to be taken seriously .
and we have the myth of higher false reporting of rape relative to other crimes ( in the us , the rate is no different : 2-@@ 4 % ) .
femini@@ sts have long argued that rape must be treated like any other crime .
but in no other crime are acc@@ users kept behind a wall of anony@@ mity . treating rape so differently serves only to maintain its mis@@ characteri@@ zation as a “ different ” kind of crime , loaded with cultural bag@@ gage and projections .
finally , there is a profound moral issue at stake .
though children ’ s identities should , of course , be shi@@ el@@ ded in sex@@ -@@ crime alle@@ ga@@ tions , women are not children .
if one makes a serious criminal acc@@ us@@ ation , one must wish to be treated – and one must treat ones@@ elf – as a moral adult .
that is why justice systems – at least in democracies – typically demand that the accused be able to face his or her acc@@ user .
why , for example , in a case that is so dependent on public opinion – and on which so much depends – must as@@ san@@ ge face alle@@ ga@@ tions that may have grave consequences for him , while his acc@@ users remain hidden ?
so-called “ rape shield ” laws should be used to protect alle@@ ged victims . it is no one ’ s business whom a victim has slept with previously , or what she was wearing when she was attacked .
nor should it be .
after all , motive and context are legitimate questions in any serious criminal alle@@ gation .
hill , for example , knew that she would have to explain why she waited years to acc@@ use thomas , her former emplo@@ yer .
likewise , adult acc@@ users of chur@@ ch-@@ protected sex criminals knew that they would have to answer fundamental questions ( not@@ ably , many of them have identified themselves , which has helped get real pro@@ secu@@ tions ) .
it is wrong – and sex@@ ist – to treat female sex@@ -@@ crime acc@@ users as if they were children , and it is wrong to try anyone , male or female , in the court of public opinion on the basis of anonymous acc@@ us@@ ations .
why is the us presidential race so close ?
washington , dc – many people around the world are probably wondering why hillary clinton – who is obviously more prepared and better su@@ ited for the american pres@@ iden@@ cy than her oppon@@ ent , don@@ ald trum@@ p – isn ’ t wal@@ tz@@ ing to victory .
many americans share the world ’ s be@@ wilder@@ ment .
national opinion polls may well continue to fluctu@@ ate until the election on november 8 .
but trum@@ p has been closing in on clinton in recent weeks , even threatening to catch up with her in the elec@@ toral college vote , where the democrats ’ control of some of the most popul@@ ous states ( new york and california ) give clinton an advantage .
why is this happening ?
for star@@ ters , trum@@ p , despite knowing almost nothing about governance or public policy , has managed to con@@ soli@@ date most republicans behind him .
one motivation is republicans ’ long-@@ held hatred of clinton .
another is the supreme court ; the court already has one vac@@ ant seat for the next president to fill and is likely to have more over the next four years .
trum@@ p has also explo@@ ited many americans ’ economic anx@@ ie@@ ties , ta@@ pping the same anti-@@ immigrant , anti-@@ elite rage that is sweeping across european countries .
but trum@@ p cannot win by appealing only to white men without a college degree .
so he has been cl@@ um@@ si@@ ly trying to suggest that he also cares about african americans and lat@@ in@@ os – not by talking to african-american and lat@@ ino voters , but by speaking in exagger@@ ated stereotypes about them to white audiences .
not surprisingly , african-@@ americans and lat@@ in@@ os consider his comments in@@ sensitive and pat@@ r@@ oni@@ zing ; white women – his real target audience – haven ’ t yet been persu@@ aded , either .
meanwhile , clinton is having her own difficulties recon@@ struc@@ ting president barack obama ’ s coalition of women , african americans , lat@@ in@@ os , and millenni@@ als .
many young people who passionately supported clinton ’ s democratic primary oppon@@ ent , senator ber@@ nie s@@ anders , have ignored s@@ anders ’ s own ad@@ mon@@ i@@ tions to support clinton , and are saying that they ’ ll vote for third-@@ party candidates , which would help trum@@ p .
since the two major parties ’ national conven@@ tions in july , each candidate has alter@@ nat@@ ely made gains and suffered losses .
this month , just as trum@@ p was rising in the polls , he attempted to separate himself from the ra@@ cist “ bir@@ ther ” movement , which fal@@ sely claims that obama – america ’ s first black president – wasn ’ t born in the united states , and thus was ine@@ li@@ gible for the pres@@ iden@@ cy .
trum@@ p ’ s re@@ marks , ter@@ se and gru@@ d@@ ging , reminded everyone that he himself was one of the lou@@ dest “ bir@@ thers ” of all .
his dama@@ ge-@@ control effort further back@@ fired , because he fal@@ sely cla@@ imed that clinton and her 2008 presidential campaign had started the bir@@ ther ru@@ mor .
many news out@@ lets finally used the word “ lie ” in their coverage of trum@@ p , who had gone essentially un@@ challenged on past fabri@@ cations .
trum@@ p ’ s recent poll@@ ing gains say less about his improvement as a candidate than they do about clinton ’ s own weak@@ nesses and bad luck .
outside her base of passionate loy@@ alists , clinton has always had a vot@@ er-@@ enthusiasm problem .
she comes across to many as a packaged know-@@ it-@@ all , the super-@@ smart girl who put off the boys in school .
and she confron@@ ts a fair amount of sex@@ ism , even among her suppor@@ ters .
( a former democratic governor recently declared that she should smile more .
would he have said that about a man ? )
but clinton has also created some of her own problems .
her poor judgment in using a private email server as secretary of state , thereby ris@@ king the dis@@ closure of classified material , has become a chronic burden for her campaign .
she com@@ po@@ unded the problem when she cla@@ imed , fal@@ sely , that her pre@@ de@@ cess@@ ors had done the same thing , and that state department security officials had clear@@ ed it .
and , unlike trum@@ p , she received no de@@ ference from the press on this issue .
the email sa@@ ga added to voters ’ long-@@ held impression that clinton isn ’ t “ honest and trust@@ worthy , ” and it exposed her to attacks from adver@@ sar@@ ies on the right .
the highly conservative advoc@@ acy group ju@@ di@@ cial watch has continually called attention to the issue , forcing the dis@@ closure of emails that clinton hadn ’ t turned over to the state department .
( the fbi found nearly 15,000 emails on clinton ’ s server that she hadn ’ t provided . )
numerous as-@@ y@@ et-@@ un@@ dis@@ closed emails with the potential to damage clinton may well be released before the election .
while fbi director james com@@ ey decided not to recommend pro@@ secu@@ tion of clinton for the email issue , he hurt her campaign by comm@@ enting that she ’ d been “ extremely car@@ eless . ”
in any case , the choice not to pro@@ sec@@ ute had republicans and conservative comm@@ ent@@ ators ho@@ w@@ ling that she ’ d received prefer@@ ential treatment from the democratic administration .
polls showed that 56 % of respon@@ dents agreed that clinton should have been pro@@ secu@@ ted .
a new issue for clinton arose in august , when the associated press reported that numerous donors to the clinton foundation had received special treatment by the state department during clinton ’ s ten@@ ure there , mainly by winning an appointment with her .
but many of these people would have received an appointment anyway ; and there is no evidence that state department policies were changed as a result .
meanwhile , the washington post has begun to report on question@@ able – possibly illegal – expen@@ di@@ tures by trum@@ p ’ s own charitable foundation .
trum@@ p , who hadn ’ t donated to his foundation since 2008 , subsequently used its funds to buy personal items ( including a six-@@ foot portrait of himself ) and to pay legal sett@@ lements .
previously , it had also been dis@@ closed that funds from the trum@@ p foundation had been used to contribute to the election campaigns of at@@ tor@@ ne@@ y@@ s-@@ general in florida and texas , which would also be illegal .
finally , clinton had the bad luck of falling ill , with cellphone video showing her nearly collap@@ sing as she left early a ceremony in new york city com@@ memor@@ ating the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attack .
this added further fuel to right-@@ wing media specu@@ lation that she is in poor health ; trum@@ p added the sex@@ ist charge that she lac@@ ks the “ stam@@ ina ” to be president .
the press covering clinton were furi@@ ous to learn that two@@ days earlier she had been diagnosed with pneumonia and had kept it to herself .
a later poll showed that the majority of the public agreed .
clinton ’ s four-@@ day con@@ val@@ es@@ cence came just as she was preparing to make the case for why people should vote for her , rather than why they shouldn ’ t vote for trum@@ p .
just as she res@@ um@@ ed campaigning , there were bomb@@ ings in new york and new jersey , and two more police sho@@ ot@@ ings of un@@ armed african americans , which spur@@ red demon@@ strations in north carolina , a swing state .
the events took over the national dialogue , with trum@@ p , as usual , playing on racial di@@ visions and bl@@ aming obama and clinton .
this is the background against which the candidates will head into face-@@ to-@@ face deb@@ ates , which tend to play a large ( even exc@@ essive ) role in shaping us elections .
it would be un@@ wise to call this election over before it is .
why marx was wrong
stockholm – the bi@@ cent@@ en@@ ni@@ al of karl marx ’ s birth has occasi@@ oned a surge of interest in the man ’ s work , complete with the unvei@@ ling of a statue in his hometown of tri@@ er , germany .
at a celebration of mar@@ x@@ ism in beijing last week , chinese president x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping declared that , “ like a spectacular sun@@ rise , the theory illumin@@ ated the path of humanity ’ s exploration of the law of history , and humanity ’ s search for &#91; its &#93; own liberation . ”
he would go on to claim that marx “ pointed out the direction , with scientific theory , toward an ideal society with no oppres@@ sion or exploitation , where every person would enjoy equality and freedom . ”
given that x@@ i ’ s words were utter@@ ed in “ mar@@ x@@ ist ” china , those in attendance had no choice but to agree with them .
yet , speaking in tri@@ er on the same day , european commission president jean-@@ c@@ lau@@ de jun@@ cker offered a somewhat generous app@@ rais@@ al of his own : “ today he stands for things which is he not responsible for and which he didn ’ t cause , because many of the things he wrote down were re@@ dra@@ fted into the opposite . ”
it is not entirely clear what jun@@ cker meant by this .
mar@@ x@@ ism , after all , has in@@ fli@@ cted un@@ told misery on tens of millions of people who have been forced to live under regimes waving its ban@@ ner .
for much of the twen@@ tieth century , 40 % of humanity suffered fam@@ ines , gu@@ la@@ gs , censorship , and other forms of repres@@ sion at the hands of self-@@ pro@@ cla@@ imed mar@@ xi@@ sts .
in his speech , jun@@ cker seemed to be all@@ u@@ ding to the standard counter@@ argument : that communist atro@@ cities throughout the twen@@ tieth century were due to some sort of distor@@ tion of marx ’ s thought , for which the man himself can sc@@ arc@@ ely be held responsible .
is there anything to this argument ?
marx spent most of his life analyzing the political economy of the industri@@ alizing mid-@@ n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ century west .
but his enduring relevance ow@@ es more to his ideas for the future , and the implications they would have for society .
in considering his legacy , this area of his thought cannot be ignored .
marx regarded private property as the source of all evil in the emerging capit@@ alist societies of his day .
accor@@ d@@ ingly , he believed that only by abo@@ li@@ shing it could society ’ s class di@@ visions be heal@@ ed , and a harmon@@ i@@ ous future en@@ su@@ red .
under communism , his collaborator frie@@ drich engel@@ s later cla@@ imed , the state itself would become unnecessary and “ wi@@ ther away . ”
these asser@@ tions were not made as specu@@ lation , but rather as scientific claims about what the future held in store .
but , of course , it was all rub@@ bis@@ h , and marx ’ s theory of history – dial@@ ec@@ tical materi@@ alism – has since been proved wrong and dangerous in practically every respect .
the great twen@@ ti@@ eth@@ -@@ century philosopher karl po@@ pper , one of marx ’ s strongest cri@@ tics , rightly called him a “ false prophet . ” and , if more evidence were needed , the countries that embraced capitalism in the twen@@ tieth century went on to become democratic , open , and prosper@@ ous societies .
by contrast , every regime that has rejected capitalism in the name of mar@@ x@@ ism has failed – and not by coincidence or as a result of some unfortunate doc@@ trin@@ al mis@@ understanding on the part of marx ’ s followers .
by abo@@ li@@ shing private ownership and establi@@ shing state control of the economy , one not only depri@@ ves society of the entrepreneurship needed to pro@@ pel it forward ; one also abo@@ li@@ shes freedom itself .
because mar@@ x@@ ism tre@@ ats all contradi@@ ctions in society as the products of a class struggle that will disappear when private property does , dis@@ sent after the establishment of communism is impossible .
by definition , any challenge to the new order must be an il@@ legitimate rem@@ nant of the oppres@@ sive order that came before .
thus , mar@@ x@@ ist regimes have in fact been logical exten@@ sions of his doc@@ trin@@ es .
of course jun@@ cker is right that marx – who died 34 years before the russian revolution – was not responsible for the gu@@ lag , and yet his ideas clearly were .
in his land@@ mark three-@@ volume study main currents of mar@@ x@@ ism , the polish philosopher les@@ ze@@ k ko@@ ł@@ ak@@ ow@@ ski , who became a leading critic of mar@@ x@@ ism after having embraced it in his youth , notes that marx showed almost no interest in people as they actually exist .
ko@@ ł@@ ak@@ ow@@ ski ’ s insight helps to explain why regimes that have embraced marx ’ s mechanical and deter@@ mini@@ stic doctrine inevitably must turn to total@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism when confron@@ ting the reality of a complex society .
they have not always fully succeeded ; but the results have always been tragic .
for his part , x@@ i views china ’ s economic development over the past few decades as “ cast iron proof ” of mar@@ x@@ ism ’ s continued vali@@ dity .
remember that it was the china of pure communism that produced the famine and terror of the “ great leap forward ” and the “ cultural revolution . ” mao ’ s decision to depri@@ ve farmers of their land and entrepreneurs of their firms had predic@@ tably disa@@ strous results , and the communist party of china has since abandoned that doc@@ trin@@ aire approach .
under mao ’ s success@@ or , deng xia@@ oping , the c@@ pc launched china ’ s great economic “ open@@ ing-@@ up . ”
after 1978 , it began to restore private ownership and per@@ mit entrepreneurship , and the results have been nothing short of spectacular .
if china ’ s development is being held back by anything today , it is the rem@@ nan@@ ts of mar@@ x@@ ism that are still visible in inefficient state-@@ owned enter@@ pris@@ es and the repres@@ sion of dis@@ sent .
china ’ s centralized single-@@ party system is simply in@@ compatible with a modern and diverse society .
two hundred years after marx ’ s birth , it is certainly wise to reflect on his intellectual legacy .
we should do so not in celebration , however , but to ino@@ cu@@ late our open societies against the total@@ itarian temptation that l@@ ur@@ ks in his false theories .
why mexico is sick
our home is far , far away from us . ”
that ’ s how it feels to live in mexico nowadays : far from democratic normal@@ cy ; far from a health system that inspir@@ es confidence ; far from a government that builds trust ; far from home and close to everything that imper@@ ils it .
my homeland has become a place where too many people are victims , suc@@ cum@@ bing to a virus , or gun@@ ned down by a dru@@ g-@@ traffi@@ cker ; assau@@ l@@ ted by a rob@@ ber , shot by an ill-@@ trained police@@ man , or kidna@@ pped by a member of a criminal gang .
the flu epidemic , which probably began in the southern state of ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , is yet another sign that all is not well in mexico .
the country seems to be caught in a permanent , un@@ easy tu@@ g-@@ of-@@ war between the past and the future , between change and the actors who seek to place obstacles in its path .
for example , when initial reports sur@@ faced about the first swine flu cases , it took three weeks for the information to reach federal health authorities , because state governments were reluctant to report cases quickly due to political and elec@@ toral consider@@ ations .
mexico faces mid-@@ term elections for congress in the fall , and president fe@@ li@@ pe cal@@ der@@ ó@@ n ’ s national action party is tra@@ iling slightly in the polls over its main ri@@ vals , who would like nothing better than to see a health emergency translate into a political defeat .
in the face of a public health system that seemed in@@ capable of diagno@@ sing and treating the outbreak quickly , the government felt it had little choice but to shut down mexico city , dealing a severe blow to an already cri@@ p@@ pled economy .
in contrast with mexico ’ s authoritarian past , when an “ imperial pres@@ iden@@ cy ” constitu@@ ted a major obstacle to moderni@@ zation , power has been dispersed .
what the executive branch has rel@@ in@@ qu@@ ished , or been forced to give up , vest@@ ed interests have sei@@ zed .
the problem is no longer too much power in the president ’ s hands , but too much power in the hands of “ ve@@ to centers ” – including publi@@ c-@@ sector uni@@ ons – that are blocking mu@@ ch-@@ needed reforms , including in the health system .
in all likelihood , the 22 reported dead from swine flu reflect a social safety net falling to pieces due to lack of public investment and union rec@@ al@@ cit@@ r@@ ance .
the flu also revealed some of mexico ’ s other fundamental flaws .
the political system has become a peculiar hybrid of authoritarian rem@@ nan@@ ts and newly established mechanisms for transparency .
the elec@@ toral process has been unable to guarantee decent democratic governance , rein in predat@@ ory practices among the political class , or make public officials follow established rules , keep them responsive to citizen preferences , and deter them from channel@@ ing public funds into private hands .
lack of accountability has both encouraged corruption and fed perceptions that abuse remains un@@ pun@@ ished .
im@@ pun@@ ity , in turn , ero@@ des the credi@@ bility of the country ’ s institutions , including public hospitals and clinics .
today , conspiracy theories abo@@ und in mexico about the origins of the virus , because government officials are viewed with such ing@@ ra@@ ined suspi@@ cion .
throughout the epidemic , citizens have largely obe@@ yed government guidelines and followed public health prescri@@ ptions .
but that doesn ’ t mean they trust the government .
publi@@ c-@@ opinion polls reveal that more than 50 % of the population believe that political parties are “ not necessary ” for the good of the country .
dis@@ approval of congress is growing , and people ’ s satisfaction with representative democracy has decreased .
in the midst of the epidemic , 66 % of mexic@@ ans believe that the country is re@@ gr@@ essing .
sevent@@ y-@@ five percent of crimes are not reported due to lack of trust in the authorities , and 98 % of crimes are never resolved or pun@@ ished .
public opinion seems dis@@ en@@ chan@@ ted with a democracy in@@ capable of offering tangible solutions to problems , the flu crisis being the most recent example .
sa@@ ddled by a viral infection , dru@@ g-@@ related inse@@ curity , and rising crime , mexico feels like a besie@@ ged place .
the not@@ ed colum@@ n@@ ist mi@@ gu@@ el angel gran@@ a@@ dos chap@@ a wrote last week : “ all that ’ s missing is for mexico to get pe@@ ed on by a dog . ”
mexico ’ s bad health is a symptom of problems that run deeper and are more widespread than swine flu .
over the past ten years , political and economic actors intent on preserving the status quo have blocked further democratic change and economic reform , con@@ dem@@ ning mexico to move sideways , even as other emerging markets surge ahead .
lately , political bat@@ tles among key actors have not been about how to build a more effective of representative political system or a more equ@@ itable , dynamic economy , but about how to maintain control of accum@@ ulated power or distribute it among their allies .
political parties appear far removed from citizen demands , bes@@ et by internal di@@ visions , in@@ capable of addressing deep-@@ rooted inequality and law@@ lessness , and prone to popu@@ list or authoritarian leadership that promises quick fix@@ es to ent@@ ren@@ ched problems .
mexico ’ s current qu@@ and@@ ary is the flu , but it faces more important challenges than a mu@@ tating micro@@ be .
with more than 40 million people living in poverty and 7,000 killed in dru@@ g-@@ related violence last year , mexico will need to reform quickly to address what the virus has brought to light : a government far removed from the suffering of ordinary people and too frequently in@@ sensitive to their p@@ light .
in this national crisis , mexico ’ s people have closed ran@@ ks , collabor@@ ated , and showed that they are capable of working together to achieve common goals in the public interest .
but their political and economic elites frequently seem in@@ capable of doing so .
that is why home seems far , far away for so many mexic@@ ans .
why more migration makes sense
oxford – in almost every rich country , anti-@@ immigrant fer@@ vor is at fever pitch .
but it is a mal@@ ady that must be resi@@ sted if these societies are to continue to prosp@@ er and developing countries are to fight poverty and sustain economic growth .
a higher rate of global migration is des@@ ir@@ able for four reasons : it is a source of innovation and dynam@@ ism ; it responds to labor shor@@ tages ; it meets the challenges posed by rapidly aging populations ; and it provides an escape from poverty and per@@ secu@@ tion .
by contrast , limit@@ ing migration slo@@ ws economic growth and under@@ mines societies ’ long-term competi@@ tiveness .
it also creates a less prosper@@ ous , more unequal , and parti@@ tioned world .
of course , there are short-@@ run , local costs to higher rates of migration that must be addressed if societies are to enjoy the much larger long-term benefits .
and yet , despite domestic opposition in recipi@@ ent countries , the number of international migr@@ ants has doubled over the past 25 years , and will double again by 2030 .
rapid economic and political change – and , increasingly , environmental change – dis@@ lo@@ dges people and encoura@@ ges them to seek opportunity and security in new homes .
against the back@@ drop of rapid globalization , the individual risks and costs of moving internation@@ ally will continue to fall .
the combination of the estimated increase in the world ’ s population by two billion people , lower transport costs , better connectivity , and growing transnational social and economic networks could and should lead to increased movement of people .
if this process is allowed to take its course , it will stimulate global growth and serve to reduce poverty .
and yet , while the incremental reduction of barriers to cross-@@ border flows of capital , goods , and services has been a major achievement of recent decades , international migration has never been more strictly controlled .
the classical economists such as john stuart mill saw this as both economically il@@ logical and eth@@ ically unacceptable .
adam smith obje@@ cted to anything that ob@@ stru@@ cted “ the free circulation of labor from one employment to another . ”
by the n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth century , the development of steam and other transport meant that one-third of the population of sc@@ andin@@ a@@ via , ireland , and parts of italy e@@ migr@@ ated .
mass migration gave millions of europeans an escape route from poverty and per@@ secu@@ tion , and fed the dynam@@ ism and development of countries like the united states , the united kingdom , and various colonies .
the rise of nation@@ alism prior to the outbreak of world war i led to the widespread introduction of pas@@ sports and us@@ her@@ ed in stri@@ c@@ ter controls on the international movement of people .
a hundred years later , despite falling barriers to trade , finance , and information , the walls to free mobility have been built higher .
approximately 200 million people , around 3 % of the world ’ s population , now live in countries in which they were not born .
these are the orph@@ ans of the international system .
in our book exceptional people , we demonstrate that , on balance , they bring great benefit to their host societies .
in addition to providing a mu@@ ch-@@ needed source of skilled and uns@@ killed labor , they contribute dis@@ proportion@@ ately to innovation and wealth creation .
for example , immigr@@ ants to the us contribute more than half of the patents and silicon valley start-@@ ups .
they also contribute more in tax than they claim through soci@@ al-@@ welfare benefits or other payments .
medical and public health advances have increased longevity in developed countries , while persi@@ stently low fertility levels and the end of the post-@@ w@@ wi@@ i baby boom mean that the number of na@@ tiv@@ e-@@ born workers will fall in the coming years .
as countries ’ populations age and their fertility rates collapse , more migration will be necessary to ensure economic competi@@ tiveness and finance pension and heal@@ th-@@ care systems .
the effects of a shrinking labor force will be com@@ po@@ unded by rising educational at@@ tainment in developed countries , which will leave fewer people interested in taking on low-@@ skilled service jobs or in working in the tra@@ des and construction .
between 2005 and 20@@ 25 , oecd countries are expected to experience a 35 % increase in the percentage of their work@@ forces with ter@@ ti@@ ary education .
as education levels rise , so do expectations about work .
for the countries they leave , migr@@ ants often represent a brain dra@@ in .
even so , they contribute significantly to their home countries .
taiwan and israel are testimony to the role played by migr@@ ants abroad , with their dias@@ por@@ as playing a vital role in terms of political support , investment flows , and technology transfer .
moreover , migration has historically been the most effective measure against poverty .
re@@ mit@@ tan@@ ces sent home by migr@@ ants exce@@ eded $ 4@@ 40 billion in 2010 , with over two-thirds of these flows going to developing countries .
in a number of small developing countries , re@@ mit@@ tan@@ ces contribute more than one-third of gdp , and in a number of larger countries , annual recei@@ pts exce@@ ed $ 50 billion .
in latin america and the caribbean , more than 50 million people are supported by re@@ mit@@ tan@@ ces , and the numbers are even greater in africa and asia .
both rich and poor countries would benefit from increased migration , with developing countries benef@@ iting the most .
it is estimated that increasing migration by just 3 % of the workforce in developed countries between 2005 and 20@@ 25 would generate global gains of $ 3@@ 56 billion , more than two-thirds of which would acc@@ ru@@ e to developing countries .
opening borders completely could produce gains as high as $ 39 trillion for the world economy over 25 years .
there has been much discussion of the need to complete the doha round of global trade negotiations and increase development assistance to poor countries .
while these actions are vital , putting migration reform on the agenda is as important – a small increase in migration would yield a much greater bo@@ on to the global economy and developing countries than the combined benefits of aid and trade reform .
today , powerful countries argue against migration reform and the development of a rul@@ es-@@ based global migration organization .
but more migration is in everyone ’ s interest , and the public debate about it is too important to be left to politicians .
deep thinking needs to be followed by bold action .
why mus@@ har@@ ra@@ f survi@@ ves
recent threats by the bush administration to cut off billions of dollars in aid to pakistan have spar@@ ked panic in government circles .
likewise , according to the pakistani ambassador in washington , military strikes by the united states aimed at al-qaeda and taliban ha@@ vens inside pakistan ’ s tribal areas would dest@@ abili@@ ze pakistan and “ possibly could bring &#91; general per@@ ve@@ z mus@@ har@@ ra@@ f &#93; down . ”
but how worried should the pakistani authorities really be in the face of growing us pressure to root out islamic mili@@ tants ?
occasi@@ onal fru@@ strations not@@ with@@ standing , it is , in fact , unlikely that the us will turn against a fai@@ thful – and dependent – ally , especially one whose leader enjo@@ ys cor@@ dial personal relations with bush .
nor , due to a lack of organized opposition , will public anger at mus@@ har@@ ra@@ f ’ s pro-@@ us policy dest@@ abili@@ ze his regime .
indeed , the wi@@ ly gener@@ al-@@ president does not merely survive crisis after crisis , but has thri@@ ved in power .
how does he do it ?
the answer lies in a fin@@ ely hon@@ ed strategy , perfe@@ cted over years , that jug@@ gles us demands and the interests of local intelligence chie@@ fs , mulla@@ hs , tribal leaders , ven@@ al politicians , and a host of fortune see@@ kers .
webs of intri@@ gue and mur@@ ky players obscure details , but the priorities are un@@ mista@@ ke@@ able .
first , american im@@ patience must be held in check .
pakistan is expected to deliver results on al-qaeda and the taliban .
however , the pot is not to be emp@@ tied all at once .
for example , when us vi@@ ce-@@ president dick chen@@ ey arrived in islam@@ abad in early march , threatening an aid cut and direct us action against islamic mili@@ tants , his message was not lost .
shortly before his un@@ marked aircraft landed , pakistan announced the capture in quet@@ ta of mulla@@ h ob@@ ai@@ dul@@ la@@ h , de@@ pu@@ ty to the elu@@ sive taliban chief , mulla@@ h o@@ mar .
ob@@ ai@@ dul@@ la@@ h carried a $ 1 million reward and was the most senior taliban captured since november 2001 .
ob@@ ai@@ dul@@ la@@ h ’ s capture – carried out reluct@@ antly – under@@ scores the pakistan military ’ s ambiguous relationship with the taliban .
despite more than 700 pakistani combat deaths , many in mus@@ har@@ ra@@ f ’ s army wish to retain the taliban as qu@@ asi@@ -@@ allies who – when the americans leave afghanistan someday – will give pakistan the “ strategic depth ” it needs against india .
thus , to the cha@@ gr@@ in of afghanistan ’ s president , ham@@ id kar@@ za@@ i , quet@@ ta remains a hub of taliban opposition to his regime .
a second aspect of mus@@ har@@ ra@@ f ’ s strategy is to create mutually beneficial relations with islam@@ ists .
this is a tricky business .
mus@@ har@@ ra@@ f cannot per@@ mit the mulla@@ hs to become too strong .
the mulla@@ hs , on the other hand , consider mus@@ har@@ ra@@ f an agent of the great sat@@ an , america , and thus a tra@@ it@@ or to islam .
nevertheless , mus@@ har@@ ra@@ f ’ s men have sk@@ ill@@ fully frac@@ tured the main islamic opposition party , mut@@ ta@@ hi@@ da maj@@ li@@ s-@@ e-@@ a@@ mal ( m@@ ma ) , with bribes , black@@ mail , and internal dis@@ sen@@ sion f@@ om@@ ented by agent provo@@ cat@@ e@@ urs .
as part of the trade-@@ off , terrorist leaders who are officially under house arrest – like mau@@ lan@@ a ma@@ so@@ od az@@ har and ha@@ fi@@ z sa@@ e@@ ed – remain able to open offices , address r@@ allies , and pre@@ ach jihad freely .
such appe@@ as@@ ement carries a price .
this is clear in islam@@ abad , where over the past two months , kal@@ ash@@ ni@@ ko@@ v-@@ tot@@ ing students have open@@ ly challenged the state , following a government order for the demo@@ li@@ tion of dozens of illeg@@ ally built mosqu@@ es and semin@@ aries .
un@@ ner@@ ved by the wil@@ d-@@ eyed students , the government fal@@ tered , then sur@@ rendered .
in a dramatic rever@@ sal , mus@@ har@@ ra@@ f ’ s minister of religious affairs , the son of former dictator general zi@@ a ul@@ -@@ ha@@ q , promised to rebuild damaged mosqu@@ es and even symbo@@ lic@@ ally laid the first stone at one construction site .
the third element of mus@@ har@@ ra@@ f ’ s strategy is more positive : he knows that he must do some good – and also be seen doing it .
this is crucial for his image as a newly emerged world leader , promising moder@@ ate islam in an ocean of extremism .
some of mus@@ har@@ ra@@ f ’ s achievements are significant .
relations with india have improved , the k@@ ash@@ mir insur@@ gency supported by pakistan has been scaled back , a women ’ s protection bill was passed in the teeth of islamic opposition , and a virul@@ ent public school curriculum that emphasi@@ zed jihad and mar@@ tyr@@ dom has been ton@@ ed down .
but men who live by the gun are willing to die by the gun , and mus@@ har@@ ra@@ f is not taking chances .
he knows that the real threat to his power – and his life – comes from within his constitu@@ ency , the military .
as a result , he has become obsessed with micro@@ managing everything from tro@@ op movements and special events to post@@ ings and pro@@ motions , all of which require his personal stamp of approval .
hard@@ line islam@@ ists , favor@@ ed previously , are now out , and soldiers charged with mu@@ tiny have received the death penalty .
although this has further dee@@ pen@@ ed pro@@ - and anti-@@ us di@@ visions within the army , among both commissioned and non-@@ commissioned officers , mus@@ har@@ ra@@ f clearly expe@@ cts to remain president well beyond the october 2007 elections , as well as to extend further his term of leadership of the army .
to achieve this end , whatever needs to be done will be done ; principles and rules are el@@ astic .
one might have expected the americans to know better than to bet all on a man who might be gone tomorrow .
with the defeat of al-qaeda and the taliban america ’ s only visible goal , it is no surprise that the us remains enormously un@@ popular among pakistan@@ is , forcing mus@@ har@@ ra@@ f to maintain his per@@ il@@ ous balancing act .
why a sin@@ o-@@ american cold war won ’ t happen
oxford – it is often said that the us and china – super@@ powers at economic , geo@@ political , and ideological log@@ ger@@ heads – are heading toward a new cold war .
and the rhetoric – at least from one side – has come to resemble that of win@@ ston chur@@ chill ’ s 194@@ 6 “ iron cur@@ tain ” speech , one of the in@@ augu@@ ral events of the cold war .
just this month , us vice president mike p@@ ence accused china of predat@@ ory economic practices , military aggression against the united states , and attempts to under@@ mine us president don@@ ald trum@@ p .
but despite the media hype , a new cold war is not inevitable – or even likely .
to be sure , chinese leaders , fe@@ aring disorder and any weak@@ ening of the communist party of china ’ s legiti@@ macy , are determined to prevent the us from forcing changes on china ’ s political and economic system .
china will continue to pursue reforms at its own pace and in its own way .
for chinese president x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping , a top priority is to merge the c@@ pc with the machinery of government in order to reduce corruption and bur@@ nish the state ’ s ideological cre@@ denti@@ als .
any attempt to interfere in this process would be crossing a red line .
fortunately for x@@ i , trum@@ p has no interest in “ democra@@ tizing ” other countries , and he doesn ’ t seem to have been swa@@ yed by the us investors , finan@@ ci@@ ers , and technology ti@@ tans who want his administration to press for more access to the chinese economy .
no doubt , us tari@@ ffs threaten the 18 % of chinese exports that go to the us each year .
but the trum@@ p administration has more urgent priorities than changing china ’ s system of government , not@@ with@@ standing the aggressive rhetoric of us trade representative robert ligh@@ thi@@ zer and white house national trade council director peter na@@ var@@ ro .
trum@@ p desperately wants to bol@@ ster us manufacturing by re@@ patri@@ ating global supply chains and blocking or cur@@ bing impor@@ ts . “ make america great again ” is really about making in america again .
still , even if today ’ s us-@@ china stan@@ do@@ ff does not evolve into a new cold war , it could wea@@ ken both countries and us@@ her in a more multi@@ polar world .
within china , us rhetor@@ ical broad@@ sides , tari@@ ffs , and san@@ ctions may be empowering x@@ i ’ s domestic cri@@ tics .
and it doesn ’ t help that china currently has limited options for re@@ tali@@ ating .
true , it could start to sell off some of its $ 1 trillion in us dollar reserves . but that would wea@@ ken the value of the us treas@@ u@@ ries that it continues to hold .
the us now constit@@ utes a minority of one within the g@@ 7 , the g@@ 20 , and the united nations framework convention on climate change . after trum@@ p pulled the us out of the trans@@ -@@ pacific partnership ( t@@ pp ) , the remaining parties moved ahead on their own .
far from setting the terms of debate on international issues , the trum@@ p administration has convinced other countries to reduce their reli@@ ance on us leadership .
widespread circum@@ vention of the us will ha@@ sten the emergence of a new multi@@ polar order .
for example , by with@@ drawing from the iran nuclear deal , trum@@ p has essentially dar@@ ed the united kingdom , france , germany , china , russia , and the european union to de@@ fy us pr@@ er@@ og@@ atives .
for now , countries that rely on iranian oil may have no choice but to go along with the us .
like most traded goods , oil exports are paid for in dollars – largely through the society for worldwide inter@@ bank financial tele@@ communication ( swi@@ ft ) in bel@@ gi@@ um – and the us has the power to shut down such trans@@ actions .
most companies and countries have concluded that doing business in iran is not worth losing access to the us market and the international dollar-@@ payments system .
but in the future , they may no longer have to make such trade@@ offs .
on august 21 , germany ’ s foreign minister , hei@@ ko ma@@ as , ur@@ ged europe to establish payment channels that are independent of the us .
and the following month , the eu ’ s foreign policy chief announced plans to form a “ special purpose vehicle ” to “ ass@@ ist and reas@@ sure economic oper@@ ators pursuing legitimate business with iran . ”
meanwhile , russia has said that it is developing its own system for financial transfers , to protect itself from being shut out of the swi@@ ft system in the event of har@@ sher us san@@ ctions .
and china has been pursuing a similar project at least since 2015 , when the people ’ s bank of china launched a system to facili@@ tate cross-@@ border trans@@ actions in ren@@ min@@ bi .
none of these alternative systems have yet to match the convenience of swi@@ ft and the dollar system .
but if a new system were to take hold , it could rapidly shift power away from the us .
rather than a cold war , the world may be heading toward an international system led by four powers , with the us , china , russia , and germany domin@@ ating their respe@@ ctive regions and seeking the upper hand in international negotiations .
such a scenario is remin@@ is@@ cent of the world war ii vision of us president franklin d. roosevelt , who proposed that the four victor@@ i@@ ous allies – the us , the uk , china , and the soviet union – act as “ four policemen , ” each pat@@ rolling its own sphere of influence and negotiating with the others on world peace .
today , approxima@@ tions of the same four powers are once again in the lead , only now we have stronger international institutions to help keep the peace .
whether that peace lasts will depend on the willingness of the four powers to use and adapt those institutions to the emerging international system .
the us with iran in syria
princeton – the prospect of a us military strike on syria has di@@ mmed following president barack obama ’ s embrace of an international initiative to take control of syria ’ s chemi@@ cal@@ -@@ weapons stock@@ pile .
the elev@@ enth@@ -@@ hour u-@@ turn on the push for military action has come against a back@@ drop of intensi@@ fying diplo@@ matic pressure from the international community to avoid escal@@ ation of the violence in syria .
and that outcome is not possible without iran .
in a joint press conference with his sy@@ rian counter@@ part , wal@@ id al-@@ mo@@ allem , russian foreign minister sergey la@@ v@@ ro@@ v tab@@ led a proposal , originally agreed with iran , calling for syria to “ place chemical weapons storage sites under international control . ” the stock@@ piles would then be destroyed and syria would fully join the international chemical weapons convention .
the second component of the russi@@ an-@@ iranian proposal calls for international efforts , under the au@@ sp@@ ices of the united nations security council , to rein in sy@@ rian rebel forces ’ chemi@@ cal@@ -@@ weapons capabilities .
mo@@ allem immediately embraced the proposal .
hours later , un secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general ban ki@@ -@@ moon did as well , while obama said that “ i fer@@ v@@ ently hope that this can be resolved in a non-@@ military way . ”
this initiative would allow obama to escape from a messy political and foreig@@ n-@@ policy predi@@ cam@@ ent .
but the matter is far from settled : obama has not ruled out a military strike .
so here are 12 reasons why america should grasp the opportunity for a diplo@@ matic resolution affor@@ ded by the russi@@ an-@@ iranian plan .
first , there is evidence that the sy@@ rian opposition has a@@ mas@@ sed chemical weapons .
in december 2012 , iran officially informed the us about chemical weapons , including sar@@ in gas , being transferred to syria .
the us declined to cooperate with iran to press ahead on the case .
second , us military strikes on syria have the potential to eng@@ ul@@ f the entire region – and perhaps the us – in a broader war .
after its experiences in afghanistan and iraq over the past decade , the us can hardly afford a sy@@ rian qu@@ ag@@ mi@@ re .
third , with the regional sun@@ ni@@ -@@ shi@@ a conflict intensi@@ fying , the prospect of tens of billions of petro@@ dollars bac@@ king terrorist extremi@@ sts has already dest@@ abili@@ zed the region .
us military strikes against syria would further fuel extremism and result in widespread atro@@ cities by the rebel@@ s against sy@@ ri@@ ans of all fai@@ ths .
reports point to the execution and muti@@ lation of sy@@ ri@@ an-@@ government prisoners .
there is no doubt that the fate of syria ’ s christian and jewish communities is now extremely pre@@ car@@ i@@ ous .
fourth , america ’ s decision to back extremi@@ sts in syria contradi@@ cts its “ war on terrorism ” and will ero@@ de international support for it .
the prospect of iranian cooperation to root out al qaeda extremi@@ sts , which it provided in afghanistan and iraq , would be unlikely following any intervention .
fifth , it is wrong to assume that without sy@@ rian president bas@@ har al-@@ as@@ sad , iran would lose its influence in the muslim world as well as its link to he@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h in lebanon .
america ’ s regional position weak@@ ened , and iran ’ s streng@@ th@@ ened , following the us-@@ led invasi@@ ons of afghanistan and iraq ; us intervention in syria could reproduce that pattern .
sixth , a us attack on syria would leave the us isolated internation@@ ally and end any hope of a diplo@@ matic resolution .
there is no domestic or international appeti@@ te for another us military adventure – nato , the g-@@ 20 , the europeans , russia , china , and 60 % of americans op@@ pose a un@@ il@@ ateral us military strike .
seventh , the civilian casu@@ alties ar@@ is@@ ing from a military strike would be high .
if the main justi@@ fication for an attack is humanitarian – to end the sen@@ sel@@ ess s@@ laughter of sy@@ rian civili@@ ans – us military intervention would do more harm than good .
eighth , us involvement in syria will breathe new life into efforts to press for a wider war between the us and iran .
al qaeda aff@@ ili@@ ates will target us regional interests in the hope that the blame falls on iran and its milit@@ ant prox@@ ies – providing a pre@@ text for us military confron@@ tation .
ninth , a us military strike against a third musli@@ m-@@ majority country would demo@@ lish the credi@@ bility of obama ’ s efforts to repair america ’ s image in the islamic world .
indeed , it would most likely prove to be a strategic bo@@ on to the “ resistance axis ” – iran and he@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h .
tenth , any us un@@ il@@ ateral military strike against syria would rat@@ ch@@ et up ten@@ sions between the us and russia .
this , in turn , would streng@@ then the russi@@ a-@@ iran alliance .
el@@ event@@ h , iranian supreme leader ay@@ at@@ ol@@ la@@ h ali k@@ ham@@ en@@ ei has issued permission for president has@@ san rou@@ han@@ i ’ s new administration to enter into direct talks with the us .
no better opportunity to end decades of bil@@ ateral hosti@@ lity is likely to come along .
in these circumstances , a us attack on syria would almost certainly d@@ ash any hope of a us-@@ iran rap@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement for years to come .
finally , with the moder@@ ate rou@@ han@@ i now installed as president , a us military strike could under@@ mine a golden opportunity for america and iran to reach a face-@@ saving solution ( for both sides ) on iran ’ s nuclear program .
both iran and the us consider the use of weapons of mass destruction a grave crime .
indeed , iran was a major victim of chemi@@ cal@@ -@@ weapons attacks during its 198@@ 0-@@ 1988 war with saddam hussein ’ s iraq .
iran can be a major partner to halt proliferation of w@@ m@@ ds in syria , the middle east , and beyond .
iran main@@ tains that the security council is the only body legally auth@@ orized to veri@@ fy alle@@ ga@@ tions concern@@ ing the use of such deadly weapons and to decide on the appropriate response .
one promising avenue for us-@@ iran cooperation on syria could be joint support for a fac@@ t-@@ finding mission by the security council to identify the perpetr@@ ators .
obama has his “ red line ” on the use of chemical weapons .
so does k@@ ham@@ en@@ ei .
why overseas chinese dominate china &apos;s exports
since the early 1990s , more foreign direct investment ( f@@ di ) has flo@@ wed into china than to any country except america .
of this vast capital in@@ flow , overseas chinese – from hong kong , taiwan , ma@@ ca@@ o and southeast asia – delivered the lion ’ s share .
investments from hong kong and ma@@ ca@@ o cla@@ imed 70 % of chinese f@@ di in the early 90s ; since then their share has decreased , yet it still accounts for 50 % of china ’ s total f@@ di .
that china receives so much capital from ex@@ patri@@ ates is a global source of envy .
indian officials be@@ mo@@ an the fact that overseas indians lack both the wealth and the pro@@ pen@@ sity to invest back home .
economists and chin@@ a-@@ wat@@ chers celebrate this ready supply of capital , know-how , and marketing channels which enabled china to become – in a short period of time – asia ’ s manufacturing base and export power-@@ house .
la@@ vis@@ h praise for this stream of ex@@ patri@@ ate f@@ di , however , mis@@ ses its deep flaws .
yes , ex@@ patri@@ at@@ e-@@ invested firms produce many chinese exports , but they often do it by sei@@ zing control of ex@@ port-@@ oriented businesses from indigenous chinese .
two rati@@ os tell the story .
one is the export / gdp ratio , which rose from 15 % in 1990 to 20 % in 1999 , an increase of 5 % .
the other is the share of exports by foreign firms of total chinese exports : this rose from 15 % to almost 40 % during the same period .
so , foreign firms may create exports for china , but they also diver@@ t a big slice of the export pie away from indigenous chinese entrepreneurs .
ex@@ patri@@ ate control of so much ex@@ port-@@ oriented businesses reflects a fundamental failing in china ’ s financial system .
china may have the second highest savings rate in the world , la@@ gging behind only singapore , but these funds are usually wasted on inefficient state-@@ owned enter@@ pris@@ es ( so@@ es ) .
these investments have failed to increase the competi@@ tiveness of chinese so@@ es , yet have star@@ ved efficient local entrepreneurs of the credi@@ ts they need .
as a result , ex@@ patri@@ ate chinese investors buy up businesses controlled by indigenous entrepreneurs on the cheap because the money they bring is the only source of funds available for business expansion .
china ’ s ability to attract so much ex@@ port-@@ oriented f@@ di is thus a warning that there is something very wrong with the financial system .
discrimin@@ ation against indigenous private entrepreneurs in china goes beyond finance .
until recently , private chinese firms could not export directly to foreign bu@@ yers and could not retain foreign exchange ear@@ nings .
but if you are in the export business , you need foreign exchange to import designs or inter@@ mediate inputs .
the restri@@ ction of access to foreign exchange made it impossible for private entrepreneurs to run independent export businesses .
chinese law also discrimin@@ ated against local export businesses .
foreign investors often complain that their property rights go un@@ protected .
true , perhaps , but private chinese entrepreneurs get a far worse deal .
as early as 1982 , china ’ s constitution contained a cl@@ ause to protect property rights of foreign investors ; domestic private entrepreneurs were not offered the same protection until 1999 !
supposedly , the match between china ’ s cheap labor costs and the entrepreneurship of ex@@ patri@@ ate chinese investors is made in heaven .
the problem with this view is that it impli@@ es that indigenous chinese entrepreneurs are somehow in@@ competent .
what matters about f@@ di is not only that foreign money comes into china , but also that it brings foreign control of business .
and foreign control only makes sense if it brings in the management know-how that local entrepreneurs lack .
is this a plau@@ sible explanation as to why chinese entrepreneurs ce@@ de control to ex@@ patri@@ ates ?
a look at other countries may be instruc@@ tive .
native indian and turkish entrepreneurs run successful export gar@@ ment businesses in their countries and contract with foreign bu@@ yers to sell goods .
the foreign bu@@ yers provide designs and even raw materials , while domestic entrepreneurs put them together according to required specifi@@ cations .
unless chinese entrepreneurs are more in@@ competent than their indian and turkish counter@@ parts - and no one suggests that – there is no reason why ex@@ patri@@ ate chinese cannot contract with indigenous entrepreneurs to produce goods for export .
the difference is that f@@ di brings not only a business opportunity but also finan@@ cing to liqui@@ di@@ ty-@@ star@@ ved chinese entrepreneurs , whereas a contract only brings forth a business opportunity .
china ’ s entrepreneurs lack money , not talent .
in fact , in some areas , chinese entrepreneurs should know more than ex@@ patri@@ ates . take traditional handi@@ cra@@ fts like ja@@ de and ivory car@@ ving .
in 1995 , there were some 900 foreig@@ n-@@ controlled firms producing traditional chinese handi@@ cra@@ fts ; the average foreign equity share was 88 % .
thus , in industries in which chinese have excell@@ ed for thousands of years , foreign control is now almost absolute .
cheap labor is the least plau@@ sible argument why so much ex@@ port-@@ oriented f@@ di has gone to china .
f@@ di is not the only form of cross-@@ border economic trans@@ action .
a hong kong firm can contract out its production in gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong province to re@@ ap the same labor@@ -@@ savings benefits it would gain from investing in china .
cheap labor explains why ex@@ patri@@ ate chinese seek to produce in china ; it does not explain why their investments are so sought after by the chinese .
as china ne@@ ars mem@@ ber@@ ship in the w@@ to , its political and administra@@ tive apparatus is mobili@@ zing to improve the investment environment and property rights for foreign investors .
but why not look after the interests of domestic entrepreneurs as well ?
the most urgent task for china ’ s government is not w@@ to mem@@ ber@@ ship , but improving the political , regul@@ atory and financial treatment of chinese entrepreneurs , who are as talented , innovative and hard working as their ex@@ patri@@ ate counter@@ parts .
there is no compelling reason why they should lose control of their businesses – often at fi@@ re-@@ sale prices – to overseas cousins on so massive a scale .
why pay more for fairness ?
marks &amp; spencer , a supermarket and clothing chain with 400 stores throughout britain , recently announced that it is conver@@ ting its entire range of coffee and tea , tot@@ aling 38 lines , to fair@@ trade , a marketing symbol of “ ethical production . ”
the chain already sells only fair@@ trade tea and coffee in its 200 café revi@@ ve coffee shops .
it is also boo@@ sting its purch@@ ases of shirts and other goods made with fair@@ trade cotton .
the announcement came during “ fair@@ trade fort@@ night , ” a two-@@ week promotion of fair@@ trade products that included speaking tours by farmers from developing countries , telling bri@@ tons how fair@@ trade has assi@@ sted their communities .
the movement toward more ethical consumption has made significant gains in the united states as well , as consumers increasingly turn to organic , locally produced foods , and eggs from hens not kept in c@@ ages .
in the uk , a survey has found that half of those shown the fair@@ trade symbol recognized it and understood that it refers to products that give a better deal for third world farmers .
there is no comparable us research , but related data , and discussions with my own students , suggests that the figure would be much lower .
tra@@ ders seeking fair@@ trade certi@@ fication must pay producers a price that covers the costs of sustainable production and provides a living wage .
for example , the minimum price for coffee is $ 1.@@ 26 per pound , no matter how low the market price may fall .
if the market price rises above that figure , the fair trade price will increase so that it remains five cents per pound higher .
small farmers , for their part , are required to be organized in co@@ opera@@ tives or other groups that allow democratic participation .
plan@@ tations and factories can use the fair@@ trade label if they pay their workers decent wages , comp@@ ly with health , safety , and environmental standards , allow uni@@ ons or other forms of workers ’ associ@@ ations , provide good housing if workers are not living at home , and do not use child labor or forced labor .
not every one appro@@ ves of fair@@ trade .
br@@ ink lind@@ sey , director of the pro-@@ market ca@@ to institute ’ s center for trade policy studies , believes that the campaign for fair@@ trade coffee is a “ well-@@ meaning dead end . ”
with some justi@@ fication , he argues that the real cause of the fall in coffee prices was not the profit@@ e@@ ering of multination@@ als , but big increases in coffee production in brazil and vietnam , combined with new techniques that make it possible to grow coffee with less labor and hence more cheap@@ ly .
in lind@@ sey ’ s view , if we want to ass@@ ist coffee gro@@ wers , we should encourage them either to abandon coffee and produce more profitable crops – and here he rightly points to rich nations ’ trade barriers and subsidies as obstacles that must be dis@@ man@@ tled – or to move into hig@@ her@@ -@@ value products , like speci@@ alty co@@ ffe@@ es , that bring higher prices .
what is curious about lind@@ sey ’ s argument , however , is that the fair@@ trade coffee campaign can be seen as doing just what he recommen@@ ds – encouraging coffee farmers to produce a speci@@ alty coffee that brings a higher price .
pro-@@ market economists don ’ t object to corporations that blat@@ antly use sno@@ b appeal to promote their products .
if people want to pay $ 48 for a pound of jama@@ i@@ can blue mountain coffee because that ’ s what james bond pre@@ fers , economists don ’ t object that the market is being distorted .
so why be critical when consumers choose to pay $ 12 for a pound of coffee that they know has been grown without toxic chemicals , under shade trees that help birds to survive , by farmers who can now afford to feed and educate their children ?
economists might rep@@ ly that if you want to help people feed and educate their children , you can pay $ 10 for a pound of non-@@ fair@@ trade coffee that tastes the same and give the $ 2 you save to an aid agency that provides food and education to poor children .
that ’ s a possible strategy , but there are advantages to fair@@ trade .
the gro@@ wers know that they have to provide a product that consumers like , both for its taste and for the way it is grown .
if their product sells well , they can take pride in having produced something that is sought after around the world .
from the gro@@ wers ’ perspective , receiving a premi@@ um by selling a fair@@ trade product is prefer@@ able to receiving a charitable hand@@ out that they would get whether they worked or not and regardless of the quality of what they produce .
paying more for a fair@@ trade label is no more “ anti-@@ market ” than paying more for a gu@@ c@@ ci label , and it reflects better ethical priorities .
fair@@ trade is not a government subsi@@ dy .
its success depends on market demand , not political lo@@ bb@@ ying .
fortunately , in europe , that market demand is growing rapidly .
one hopes that it will soon reach similar levels throughout the developed world , and wherever people can make choices about their discre@@ tionary spending .
the popu@@ list war against intelligence
atlanta – despite his seemingly limit@@ less capacity for v@@ indic@@ tiveness , it would be a mistake to interpret us president don@@ ald trum@@ p ’ s decision to with@@ draw the security clear@@ ance of former cia director john brenn@@ an as only his latest ven@@ de@@ tta for l@@ è@@ se-@@ maje@@ st@@ é .
true , brenn@@ an has all but labeled trum@@ p and his behavior , including his russian connections , a national security threat .
but trum@@ p ’ s move is more than personal pay@@ back .
as the most recent blow in his two-@@ year-@@ long attack on the intelligence community , his sla@@ p at brenn@@ an is a harb@@ inger of more to come as he tries to bring his es@@ pi@@ on@@ age agencies to heel .
more omin@@ ously for the health of the democracies of the west , other popu@@ lists are following trum@@ p ’ s example .
in europe , a variety of right-@@ wing parties , having now found themselves in power , are taking on former government an@@ tag@@ onists , who have monit@@ ored and poli@@ ced their extremism for decades .
in austria , the country ’ s popu@@ list leaders have been intimi@@ dating , mu@@ zz@@ ling , and pur@@ ging the country ’ s intelligence services .
in february , on orders from the popu@@ list interior minister , austri@@ an police ra@@ i@@ ded the country ’ s main intelligence agency – the very organization charged with monitoring right-@@ wing extremism .
( it should be rec@@ alled that the freedom party , the coalition partner in austri@@ an chan@@ cell@@ or sebastian kurz ’ s government , was founded by ex-@@ ss officers ) .
and what was the pre@@ text for the raid and subsequ@@ ent demo@@ tion of senior austri@@ an intelligence officials ?
that the agency was running an operation aimed at har@@ ming north korea .
no doubt , trum@@ p wishes that he could pull off such a stunt , and both halt the investigation of him led by robert mu@@ eller and bring to heel all of the us intelligence agencies .
a fan of stron@@ gman leaders who “ get it done , ” trum@@ p ad@@ mir@@ es diktat@@ s and bra@@ zen contemp@@ t for legal processes .
he almost certainly will pay even closer attention as the intelligen@@ ce-@@ fu@@ eled investig@@ ations into his presidential campaign ’ s possible coll@@ usion with moscow in 20@@ 16 close in on him .
it is this combination of self-interest and contemp@@ t for law that makes trum@@ p ’ s re@@ voc@@ ation of the brenn@@ an ’ s security clear@@ ance so troubling .
the regulations gover@@ ning clear@@ ances are straightforward : the president has the power to deny access to official secrets if someone is found to have com@@ promised classified information or is at risk of doing so .
by all accounts , brenn@@ an has done nothing of the sort .
in fact , trum@@ p admit@@ s that .
buried in the explan@@ atory word salad that accompanied the re@@ voc@@ ation of brenn@@ an ’ s security clear@@ ance , the white house cla@@ imed that brenn@@ an ’ s “ er@@ ra@@ tic ” behavior was the cause .
that acc@@ us@@ ation would be lau@@ g@@ hable if it wasn ’ t so serious .
trum@@ p has simply ignored the laws – including laws gover@@ ning the us intelligence services – that he s@@ wore fai@@ th@@ fully to ex@@ ec@@ ute .
el@@ even former cia directors and de@@ pu@@ ty directors , as well as 70 former senior cia officers ( including me ) , said as much last week , critici@@ zing the unprecedented re@@ voc@@ ation as political co@@ er@@ cion and acc@@ using trum@@ p of mis@@ using presidential powers , dama@@ ging national security , and threatening current and former officials ’ right of free speech .
as if to under@@ score the point , white house spo@@ kes@@ people say that trum@@ p inten@@ ds to order more re@@ vo@@ cations , including a former national security advis@@ er and de@@ pu@@ ty at@@ tor@@ ney general , as well as former directors of national intelligence , the cia and the national security agency .
the hit list is no coincidence .
those in the cros@@ sha@@ irs have over@@ seen intelligence collection and analysis that informed the intelligence community ’ s conclusion that russia interfer@@ ed in the 20@@ 16 election , including possible coll@@ usion with trum@@ p ’ s presidential campaign .
with attacks on the intelligence and law en@@ for@@ cement communities playing well among his suppor@@ ters , trum@@ p could well double down on this de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ ery .
but his willingness to use his presidential powers as a blat@@ antly partisan political weapon breaks ground that no american should want him to tre@@ ad .
the damage that has resulted from the raid in austria shows why .
while austri@@ an courts ultimately will determine the raid ’ s leg@@ ality , the effects are already clear .
by stri@@ pping austria ’ s spi@@ es of their files , the raid has essentially put the intelligence service out of operation and raised doub@@ ts among al@@ lied intelligence services about the austri@@ ans ’ reli@@ ability .
internal operations are dead in the water , as is intelligence sharing with european counter@@ parts .
washington is not vienna , but the parall@@ els deserve close attention nonetheless .
trum@@ p ’ s attacks on the intelligence community and its former leaders are unprecedented , and it would be naive not to consider their impact , not only on the current intelligence leadership but also on the r@@ ank@@ -and-@@ file officers that do the difficult and often dangerous work of intelligence gathering and analysis .
that is why it is so important to ad@@ here to the laws that empower ( and constra@@ in ) intelligence agencies and that under@@ pin the political independence and integrity of their officers .
events in austria should be a warning .
for democracies to thrive , government must be transparent as well as publicly accountable .
when it comes to over@@ seeing intelligence agencies ple@@ dged to protect their sources and methods , the challenges are obvious .
but so , too , are the threats , including to the democratic process itself , when politicians viol@@ ate rather than respect the rules that govern their intelligence services ’ integrity .
in the final analysis , brenn@@ an isn ’ t the only victim of trum@@ p ’ s un@@ war@@ ran@@ ted and v@@ indi@@ ctive action .
so are all americans when national leaders put their own interests above those of the country and corrupt the political system they are s@@ wor@@ n to defend .
why put charles taylor on trial
we pe@@ ti@@ tioned nigeria &apos;s federal high court last may to review the decision of nigerian president ol@@ use@@ gun ob@@ as@@ an@@ jo to grant refugee status to former li@@ beri@@ an president charles taylor , who is a fu@@ gi@@ tive from war crimes charges brought by a united nation@@ s-@@ backed special court in sierra leone .
we are two of taylor &apos;s many victims .
seven years ago , we were young nigerian business@@ men trading in electronic hardware and medical equipment on africa &apos;s west coast .
we pro@@ cu@@ red our supplies in nigeria and expor@@ ted them to liberia and sierra leone .
in the summer of 1997 , david was in mon@@ ro@@ via when charles taylor was in@@ au@@ gur@@ ated president of liberia following an eight-@@ year civil war .
one year later , the un and the economic community of west african states deployed soldiers as peace@@ keepers in neighbor@@ ing sierra leone to guarantee a ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire in that country &apos;s near-@@ deca@@ de-@@ long conflict , inst@@ ig@@ ated by rebel@@ s of the revolutionary united front .
in the fall of 1998 , we traveled separ@@ ately on business trips to free@@ town , the capital of sierra leone .
on previous vis@@ its , we had heard reports of atro@@ cities committed by ruf rebel@@ s , including ampu@@ tations , ra@@ pes , and muti@@ lations of civili@@ ans in the countryside .
but the presence of the international community reas@@ su@@ red us that it was safe to do business in the country .
both our home government and friends in sierra leone agreed .
we planned to spend the christmas and new year holi@@ days in free@@ town before returning to nigeria early in 1999 .
then our plans went aw@@ ry .
shortly before christmas , ru@@ mor@@ s of an im@@ pen@@ ding rebel assau@@ lt began to filter into sierra leone &apos;s capital .
first a trick@@ le , then a delu@@ ge of intern@@ ally displaced persons arrived .
we tried to change our flights and return to nigeria , but there were no flights available .
on january 6 , the rebel@@ s over@@ ran the home where we were staying in free@@ town .
we were among nine nigeri@@ ans staying there .
the rebel@@ s - over one hundred of them , many young teenagers - surrounded our building , set it on fire , and ordered all nigeri@@ ans to come out .
their commander , who spoke with a distinct li@@ beri@@ an accent , called himself captain gold@@ teeth .
when we tried to escape , the rebel@@ s captured us .
captain gold@@ teeth had us brought to a bus terminal next to our residen@@ ce , where more than 80 other cap@@ tives were assembled .
he said that he had instructions - from the executive man@@ sion in mon@@ ro@@ via - to send a message to nigeria , the leading tro@@ op contribu@@ tor and finan@@ ci@@ er of the regional peace@@ keeping force , e@@ com@@ o@@ g .
captain gold@@ teeth asked the &quot; cu@@ t-@@ hand-@@ cu@@ t-@@ foot man &quot; to separate nigeri@@ ans from the others .
then they began to ampu@@ tate us .
their first victim was emmanuel &apos;s younger brother , ben@@ edi@@ ct eg@@ bun@@ a .
they cut off his hands from beneath the elbow .
he bled to death in front of his pregnant wife , za@@ in@@ ab , and us before he was dumped behind the house .
many of our best friends were also mu@@ til@@ ated and killed .
next it was our turn .
the ma@@ che@@ te cut through emmanuel &apos;s flesh and bones but did not entirely se@@ ver them .
with hands dan@@ gling from his arms , the rebel@@ s dumped emmanuel in the ce@@ me@@ tery .
they then cut off david &apos;s arms before setting him ab@@ la@@ ze .
neither of us knows how we survived this or@@ deal .
ben@@ edi@@ ct eg@@ bun@@ a &apos;s five-@@ year old son , ben@@ edi@@ ct jr . , born five months after the s@@ laughter of his father , is a source of comfort to both of us and to all who knew his father .
someday , when he grows up , ben@@ edi@@ ct j@@ r. will look to us to reconstruct the memories of the father he will never know .
at a later point , ben@@ edi@@ ct will almost certainly also ask us what happened to those responsible for his father &apos;s killing .
what shall we tell him ?
we have a duty to seek justice for the victims of charles taylor &apos;s crimes .
refugee status is a humanitarian shelter .
nigeria must not let it be used as a ty@@ rant &apos;s shield .
why pu@@ tin makes a bad ally
stanford – russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin ’ s intervention in the sy@@ rian conflict has been wel@@ com@@ ed by some as a moment for the kre@@ m@@ lin to “ come in from the cold . ”
russia ’ s conflict with the islamic state , the argument goes , has alig@@ ned the country ’ s interests with those of the west .
even turkey ’ s dow@@ ning of a russian war@@ plane does not seem not to have de@@ fl@@ ated this optimism .
indeed , at a recent press conference , us president barack obama again ur@@ ged pu@@ tin to join the alliance against the islamic state .
and french president fran@@ ç@@ ois holl@@ an@@ de bil@@ led his recent visit to moscow as an effort to build a broad international coalition against the terrorist group .
at first bl@@ ush , the idea that russia is a natural ally against islam@@ ist terrorists seems to make sense .
the country has suffered horrific terrorist attacks by islam@@ ist extremi@@ sts , including the bom@@ bing in november of a plane above the sin@@ ai pen@@ insu@@ la , which killed 2@@ 24 passengers and crew , nearly all of them russian .
around 20 million muslims , most of them sun@@ ni , live within the russian feder@@ ation , and the country ’ s security officials report that some 7,000 fighters from the former soviet republi@@ cs and russia have joined the islamic state .
on deeper exam@@ ination , however , it becomes clear that an anti-@@ terror alliance with russia is wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking .
pu@@ tin has not gone into syria to defeat the islamic state . he has interven@@ ed to save the regime of russia ’ s client , sy@@ rian president bas@@ har al-@@ as@@ sad .
pu@@ tin may sometimes give the appearance that he is ready to abandon as@@ sad , but ultimately he will defend him .
leaving as@@ sad to his fate would be a sign of weakness – and thus ana@@ thema to pu@@ tin .
ordinary russians may be in danger of attacks by islamic extremi@@ sts , but they pose little threat to pu@@ tin or his allies .
russia has indeed suffered a number of terrorist attacks , including the 2004 bes@@ lan mas@@ sac@@ re , in which 3@@ 34 people , most of them school@@ children , were killed .
in nearly every case , the response to the attacks was brutal , ine@@ pt , and costly in terms of civilian lives lost .
and yet the pu@@ tin regime has emerged uns@@ ca@@ th@@ ed each time .
indeed , terrorist attacks at the turn of the century soli@@ di@@ fied public opinion against che@@ chen rebel@@ s and gave pu@@ tin the public support he needed to ra@@ ze gro@@ z@@ ny , che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya ’ s capital .
pu@@ tin ’ s confidence in dealing with terrorism reflects the design of russia ’ s security state .
russia spends more on internal security than it does on national defense .
it has interior ministry troops , federal security agency ( fs@@ b ) special forces , om@@ on ( mobile special service ) troops , military intelligence troops , and a vast network of internal spi@@ es and infor@@ man@@ ts .
regime oppon@@ ents are not allowed to run for office , their rights to demonstrate are restricted , and they are subject to a legal arbit@@ rar@@ iness in the courts .
citizens have virtually no protection from wi@@ re@@ ta@@ ps or the inter@@ ception of their electronic communications .
every society must balance civil rights against national security .
pu@@ tin ’ s russia has sw@@ ung to one extreme of the spectrum , while the united states and europe ( despite the prote@@ sts of civil liber@@ t@@ arians ) have chosen to occupy the other end .
indeed , russia is an example of the upper limit of what state power can do to control terrorist activity .
it would be a rare extrem@@ ist group that had not been infil@@ tr@@ ated with an inform@@ ant who reports to moscow .
there is even evidence that those who carried out the bes@@ lan mas@@ sac@@ re were infil@@ tr@@ ated by russian intelligence .
moreover , any terrorist group knows that their operations will be met with the most extreme use of force .
in bes@@ lan , for example , russian special forces used thermo@@ bar@@ ic weapons .
as the reaction to the attacks in paris illustrates , the seemingly random murder of 130 civili@@ ans has monum@@ ental resonance in the west – especially when the religious and ideological mo@@ tives are difficult to understand .
but the kre@@ m@@ lin places a lower value on human lives than western societies do .
in pu@@ tin ’ s calculations , the loss of lives in extrem@@ ist attacks is un@@ welcome , but ultimately acceptable if it does not threaten the regime .
the russian people might be horri@@ fied and frightened . but the russian regime is primarily concerned with its own survival – and with how it might use the public ’ s horror to its benefit .
working with the west to combat the islamic state serves neither of those purposes .
new york – the united states federal reserve ’ s decision to under@@ take a third round of quantitative e@@ asing , or q@@ e@@ 3 , has raised three important questions .
will q@@ e@@ 3 jum@@ p-@@ start america ’ s ane@@ mic economic growth ?
will it lead to a persistent increase in risky assets , especially in us and other global equity markets ?
finally , will its effects on gdp growth and equity markets be similar or different ?
many now argue that q@@ e@@ 3 ’ s effect on risky assets should be as powerful , if not more so , than that of q@@ e@@ 1 , q@@ e@@ 2 , and “ operation twist , ” the fed ’ s earlier bon@@ d-@@ purchase program .
after all , while the previous ro@@ unds of us mon@@ etary e@@ asing have been associated with a persistent increase in equity prices , the size and duration of q@@ e@@ 3 are more substantial .
but , despite the fed ’ s impressive commitment to aggressive mon@@ etary e@@ asing , its effects on the real economy and on us equi@@ ties could well be smaller and more fle@@ eting than those of previous q@@ e ro@@ unds .
consider , first , that the previous q@@ e ro@@ unds came at times of much lower equity valu@@ ations and ear@@ nings .
in march 2009 , the s &amp; p 500 index was down to 6@@ 60 , ear@@ nings per share ( eps ) of us companies and banks had sun@@ k to a finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ crisis low , and price / ear@@ nings rati@@ os were in the single digits .
today , the s &amp; p 500 is more than 100 % higher ( ho@@ vering near 1,@@ 4@@ 30 ) , the average eps is close to $ 100 , and p / e rati@@ os are above 14 .
even during q@@ e@@ 2 , in the summer of 2010 , the s &amp; p 500 , p / e rati@@ os , and eps were much lower than they are today .
if , as is likely , economic growth in the us remains ane@@ mic in spite of q@@ e@@ 3 , top-@@ line revenues and bottom@@ -@@ line ear@@ nings will turn south , with negative effects on equity valu@@ ations .
moreover , fiscal support is ab@@ sent this time : q@@ e@@ 1 and q@@ e@@ 2 helped to prevent a deeper recession and avoid a double dip , respe@@ ctively , because each was associated with a significant fiscal stimulus .
in contrast , q@@ e@@ 3 will be associated with a fiscal contra@@ ction , possibly even a large fiscal cliff .
even if the us avo@@ ids the full fiscal cliff of 4.@@ 5 % of gdp that is lo@@ oming at the end of the year , it is highly likely that a fiscal drag amo@@ unting to 1.5 % of gdp will hit the economy in 2013 .
with the us economy currently growing at a 1.@@ 6 % annual rate , a fiscal drag of even 1 % impli@@ es near-@@ stag@@ nation in 2013 , though a modest recovery in housing and manufacturing , together with q@@ e@@ 3 , should keep us growth at about its current level in 2013 .
but there is no broader re@@ bound underway .
in both 2010 and 2011 , leading economic indi@@ cators showed that the first-@@ half slow@@ down had bottom@@ ed out , and that growth was already accelerating before the announcement of mon@@ etary e@@ asing .
thus , q@@ e nu@@ dged along an economy that was already reco@@ vering , which pro@@ lon@@ ged asset ref@@ lation .
by contrast , the latest data suggest that the us economy is performing as slu@@ g@@ g@@ ish@@ ly now as it was in the first half of the year .
indeed , if anything , weakness in the us labor market , low capital expen@@ di@@ tures , and slow income growth have contradi@@ cted signals in the early summer that third-@@ quarter growth might be more robust .
meanwhile , the main transmission channels of mon@@ etary stimulus to the real economy – the bond , credit , currency , and stock markets – remain weak , if not broken .
indeed , the bon@@ d-@@ market channel is unlikely to boost growth .
long-term government bond yields are already very low , and a further reduction will not significantly change private agents ’ borrowing costs .
the credit channel also is not working properly , as banks have ho@@ ar@@ ded most of the extra liqui@@ dity from q@@ e , creating excess reserves rather than increasing len@@ ding .
those who can borrow have am@@ ple cash and are cau@@ tious about spending , while those who want to borrow – highly inde@@ b@@ ted households and firms ( especially small and medi@@ um-@@ size enter@@ pris@@ es ) – face a credit crun@@ ch .
the currency channel is similarly impaired .
with global growth weak@@ ening , net exports are unlikely to improve robu@@ stly , even with a weaker dollar .
moreover , many major central banks are imple@@ menting vari@@ ants of q@@ e alongside the fed , dam@@ pen@@ ing the effect of the fed ’ s actions on the dollar ’ s value .
perhaps most important , a weaker dollar ’ s effect on the trade balance , and thus on growth , is limited by two factors .
first , a weaker dollar is associated with a higher dollar price for commodities , which impli@@ es a drag on the trade balance , because the us is a net commodi@@ ty-@@ impor@@ ting country .
second , any improvement in gdp derived from stronger exports leads to an increase in impor@@ ts .
empiri@@ cal studies estimate that the overall impact of a weaker us dollar on the trade balance is close to zero .
the only other significant channel to transmit q@@ e to the real economy is the wealth effect of an equ@@ ity-@@ market increase , but there is some circul@@ arity in the argument that q@@ e@@ 3 will lead to a persistent rise in equity prices .
if persistent asset ref@@ lation requires a significant gdp growth recovery , it is tau@@ t@@ ological to say that if equity prices rise enough following q@@ e , the resul@@ ting increase in gdp from a wealth effect justi@@ fies the rise in asset prices .
if mon@@ etary policy ’ s transmission channels to the real economy are broken , one cannot assume that q@@ e will have a significant effect on economic growth .
fed chair@@ man ben ber@@ nan@@ ke has recently emphasi@@ zed the importance of an additional channel : the confidence channel , through which the fed ’ s commitment to maintaining generous mon@@ etary conditions for longer could improve private spending .
the issue is how substantial and durable such effects will be .
confidence is fragile in an environment characterized by ongoing dele@@ ver@@ aging , ma@@ cro un@@ certain@@ ties , weak labor@@ -@@ market growth , and a fiscal drag .
in short , q@@ e@@ 3 reduces the tail risk of an ou@@ tri@@ ght economic contra@@ ction , but is unlikely to lead to a sustained recovery in an economy that is still enduring a painful dele@@ ver@@ aging process .
in the short run , q@@ e@@ 3 will lead investors to take on risk , and will stimulate modest asset ref@@ lation .
but the equ@@ ity-@@ price rise is likely to fi@@ zz@@ le out over time if economic growth disap@@ points , as is likely , and dra@@ gs down expectations about corporate revenues and profit@@ ability .
sh@@ in@@ z@@ o abe ’ s mon@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ policy delu@@ sions
new haven – the politi@@ ci@@ zation of central banking continues unab@@ ated .
the resurrec@@ tion of sh@@ in@@ z@@ o abe and japan ’ s liberal democratic party – pillars of the political system that has left the japanese economy mi@@ red in two lost decades and counting – is just the latest case in point .
japan ’ s recent election hin@@ ged critically on abe ’ s views of the bank of japan ’ s mon@@ etary policy stance .
he argued that a ti@@ mi@@ d bo@@ j should learn from its more aggressive counter@@ parts , the us federal reserve and the european central bank .
just as the fed and the ec@@ b have apparently saved the day through their un@@ conventional and aggressive quantitative e@@ asing ( q@@ e ) , goes the argument , abe believes it is now time for the bo@@ j to do the same .
it certainly looks as if he will get his way .
with bo@@ j governor ma@@ sa@@ ak@@ i shi@@ ra@@ ka@@ wa ’ s term ending in april , abe will be able to select a success@@ or – and two de@@ pu@@ ty gover@@ nor@@ s as well – to do his bi@@ dding .
but will it work ?
while experimental mon@@ etary policy is now widely accepted as standard operating procedure in today ’ s post-@@ crisis era , its efficacy is du@@ bi@@ ous .
nearly four years after the world hit bottom in the after@@ math of the global financial crisis , q@@ e ’ s impact has been stri@@ k@@ ingly asym@@ metric .
while massive liqui@@ dity inje@@ ctions were effective in un@@ freezing credit markets and arrested the worst of the crisis – witness the role of the fed ’ s first round of q@@ e in 200@@ 9@@ -@@ 2010 – subsequ@@ ent efforts have not spar@@ ked anything close to a normal cycli@@ cal recovery .
the reason is not hard to fa@@ tho@@ m .
hob@@ bled by severe damage to private and publi@@ c-@@ sector balance sheets , and with policy interest rates at or near zero , post-@@ bubble economies have been mi@@ red in a classic “ liqui@@ dity trap . ”
they are more focused on paying down massive debt over@@ hangs built up before the crisis than on assuming new debt and boo@@ sting aggregate demand .
the sad case of the american consumer is a classic example of how this plays out .
in the years leading up to the crisis , two bubbles – property and credit – fu@@ eled a recor@@ d-@@ high person@@ al-@@ consumption bin@@ ge .
when the bubbles burst , households understand@@ ably became fix@@ ated on bal@@ ance@@ -@@ sheet repair – namely , paying down debt and rebuilding personal savings , rather than res@@ um@@ ing exc@@ essive spending habits .
indeed , not@@ with@@ standing an unprecedented post-@@ crisis tri@@ pling of fed assets to roughly $ 3 trillion – probably on their way to $ 4 trillion over the next year – us consumers have pulled back as never before .
in the 19 quarters since the start of 2008 , annu@@ alized growth of infla@@ tion-@@ adju@@ sted consumer spending has aver@@ aged just 0.@@ 7 % – almost three percentage points below the 3.@@ 6 % trend increases recorded in the 11 years ending in 2006 .
nor does the ec@@ b have reason to be gra@@ ti@@ fied with its strain of quantitative e@@ asing .
despite a doubling of its balance sheet , to a little more than € 3 trillion ( $ 4 trillion ) , europe has sli@@ pped back into recession for the second time in four years .
not only is q@@ e ’ s ability to jum@@ p@@ start cris@@ is-@@ torn , bal@@ ance@@ -@@ she@@ et-@@ constrained economies limited ; it also runs the important risk of blur@@ ring the distinction between mon@@ etary and fiscal policy .
central banks that buy sovereig@@ n debt issued by fiscal authorities off@@ set market@@ -@@ imposed discipline on borrowing costs , effectively subsidi@@ zing publi@@ c-@@ sector pro@@ fli@@ g@@ acy .
unfortunately , it appears that japan has forgotten many of its own lessons – especially the bo@@ j ’ s disap@@ pointing experience with zero interest rates and q@@ e in the early 2000 ’ s .
but it has also lost sight of the 1990 ’ s – the first of its so-called lost decades – when the authorities did all they could to pro@@ long the life of in@@ sol@@ vent banks and many non@@ financial corporations .
z@@ om@@ bie@@ -like companies were kept on artificial life-@@ support in the false hope that time alone would revi@@ ve them .
it was not until late in the decade , when the banking sector was re@@ organized and corporate re@@ struc@@ turing was encouraged , that japan made progress on the long , ardu@@ ous road of bal@@ ance@@ -@@ sheet repair and structural transformation .
us authorities have suc@@ cum@@ bed to the same japan@@ es@@ e-@@ like temp@@ tations .
from quantitative e@@ asing to recor@@ d-@@ high federal budget defic@@ its to unprecedented bail@@ outs , they have done everything in their power to mask the pain of bal@@ ance@@ -@@ sheet repair and structural adju@@ st@@ ment .
as a result , america has created its own generation of z@@ om@@ bies – in this case , z@@ om@@ bie consumers .
like japan , america ’ s post-@@ bubble healing has been limited – even in the face of the fed ’ s out@@ size liqui@@ dity inje@@ ctions .
household debt stood at 1@@ 12 % of income in the third quarter of 2012 – down from record high@@ s in 2006 , but still nearly 40 percentage points above the 75 % norm of the last three decades of the twen@@ tieth century .
similarly , the person@@ al-@@ saving rate , at just 3.5 % in the four months ending in november 2012 , was less than half the 7.@@ 9 % average of 197@@ 0-@@ 99 .
the same is true of europe .
the ec@@ b ’ s über@@ -@@ aggressive actions have achieved little in the way of bringing about long-@@ awa@@ ited structural transformation in the region .
cris@@ is-@@ torn peripher@@ al european economies still suffer from unsustainable debt loads and serious productivity and competi@@ tiveness problems .
and a fragmented european banking system remains one of the weak@@ est links in the regional daisy chain .
is this the “ cure ” that abe really wants for japan ?
the last thing that the japanese economy needs at this point is back@@ sli@@ ding on structural reforms .
yet , by forcing the bo@@ j to follow in the mis@@ directed foot@@ steps of the fed and the ec@@ b , that is precisely the risk that abe and japan are facing .
massive liqui@@ dity inje@@ ctions carried out by the world ’ s major central banks – the fed , the ec@@ b , and the bo@@ j – are neither achieving tra@@ ction in their respe@@ ctive real economies , nor facili@@ tating bal@@ ance@@ -@@ sheet repair and structural change .
that leaves a huge sum of excess liqui@@ dity slo@@ shing around in global asset markets .
where it goes , the next crisis is inevitably do@@ omed to follow .
why remember pearl harbor ?
new york – december 7 marks the 6@@ 7@@ th anniversary of the japanese attack on pearl harbor .
over the years , “ the day of in@@ fam@@ y ” has become a classic reference point for gal@@ vani@@ zing patri@@ otic senti@@ ment in america .
in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attack , for example , analo@@ gies to pearl harbor were made frequently .
but despite its central place in america ’ s collective memory , pearl harbor remains little understood .
why did japan initi@@ ate such a seemingly self-@@ destructive war in the first place ?
aside from lessons that japan must learn from its moment@@ ous decision , is there something to be learned by the united states as well ?
the decision to attack pearl harbor was reached after five months of deliber@@ ations that included numerous official conferences .
it was a gradu@@ al process in which more sym@@ pathetic , alb@@ eit firm , us engagement might have helped s@@ way japan in a different direction .
in fact , japanese government opinion was so divided that it is surprising that it was able to unite in the end .
many in the japanese army initially regarded the soviet union as the main threat facing the country .
others saw the us as the primary enemy .
some were concerned with more abstract , ideological enemies , such as communism and “ americ@@ an@@ ism , ” while there were also voices high@@ lighting the men@@ ace of the “ white race ” ( including japan ’ s allies , germany and italy ) against the “ yellow race . ”
then there were those who preferred not to fight any enemy at all , particularly the us , whose long-term war@@ -@@ making power , the government knew , far sur@@ passed japan ’ s own .
the tac@@ tical master@@ mind of the pearl harbor operation , admi@@ ral is@@ or@@ ok@@ u y@@ ama@@ mo@@ to , was one of them .
over the course of the summer of 194@@ 1 , events slowly til@@ ted japan towards the possibility of war with the west .
but pearl harbor was in no way inevitable .
germany ’ s attack on the soviet union comp@@ elled japan in july 194@@ 1 to prepare a plan of attack .
although it made clear japan ’ s desire to take advantage of the european conflict and gain a fo@@ oth@@ old in the european colonies in southeast asia , the plan was not clear about who constitu@@ ted japan ’ s true enemy .
japan ’ s military thrust into southeast asia led president franklin del@@ ano roosevelt ’ s administration to impose san@@ ctions .
the us fro@@ ze japanese assets , an example followed by britain and the dutch east in@@ dies .
when japan responded by taking over southern french in@@ do@@ china , the us re@@ tali@@ ated by im@@ posing an embar@@ go on oil exports to japan .
rather than telling japan that the us was determined to search for a diplo@@ matic solution , america ’ s categ@@ or@@ ical reaction confir@@ med it to the japanese as an arrogant and concei@@ ted enemy .
moreover , by transfer@@ ring its pacific fleet from san diego to pearl harbor , the us encouraged the japanese understanding that the us fully anticipated war with japan .
world war ii in the pacific finally came about for many different reasons .
but it was , above all , the sense of en@@ cir@@ cle@@ ment and humili@@ ation that united the deeply divided japanese government .
feeling defeated by a series of failed approaches to the us , including an over@@ ture to hold direct talks with roosevelt , prime minister fu@@ mi@@ mar@@ o kon@@ o@@ e res@@ ig@@ ned on october 16 , making hard-@@ line army minister hi@@ de@@ ki t@@ ō@@ j@@ ō his success@@ or .
the high-@@ handed tone of the h@@ ull note of november 26 , demanding japan ’ s with@@ dra@@ wal of all its troops from china , was a final blow to the moder@@ ates in japan ’ s government , who still hoped for diplo@@ matic negotiations .
by this time , many policymakers were convinced that the us was not ready to hear them out .
it was ultimately in the name of saving asia for all asi@@ ans from what was regarded as western arrogan@@ ce that the government united to wage war .
on december 1 , it was decided that the war would commen@@ ce in six days .
there were legitimate historical reasons for japan to feel humili@@ ated on the eve of war .
the gun@@ boat diplomacy that resulted in the opening of japan and unequal treaties in the mid-@@ 19th century was but a beginning .
more immediately , the great depression and the subsequ@@ ent com@@ part@@ ment@@ alization of the world into economic blo@@ cs also worked to the advantage of the already powerful .
coupled with the economic hard@@ ship of the inter@@ war years were instances of racial prejudice in the us that aimed at preventing japanese immigration .
united by this long-@@ sim@@ mer@@ ing and humili@@ ating sense of exclu@@ sion , japanese policymakers , whatever their differences , stumbled toward the december 1 decision to go to war .
with almost 70 years of hin@@ d@@ sight , pearl harbor should offer some lessons for us foreign policy today .
despite obvious differences between pearl harbor and recent islam@@ ist terrorist tactics , they show the common desire of self-@@ pro@@ cla@@ imed da@@ vi@@ ds to top@@ ple their goli@@ a@@ ths in a clearly lo@@ p-@@ si@@ ded battle .
these da@@ vi@@ ds depend on western technologies to overcome im@@ balances of power , and are driven by a sense of real or imagined humili@@ ation .
but no matter how strong and historically justi@@ fied such gri@@ ev@@ ances may be those who resort to mur@@ der@@ ous tactics must be con@@ dem@@ ned .
however , high-@@ han@@ de@@ dness and tough talk alone are an inadequate response , for this approach further humili@@ ates those who already feel humili@@ ated , and ali@@ en@@ ates those who might otherwise pro@@ ffer a more moder@@ ate voice .
diplomacy no longer works with terrorism , but it can help to prevent it by dealing carefully with potentially hostile states .
with global expectations moun@@ ting for a fresh start in us foreign policy , it is vital not just to remember , but to understand the attack on pearl harbor .
new york – most people around the world will not be able to vote in the united states ’ s up@@ coming presidential election , even though they have a great deal at stake in the result .
overwhel@@ m@@ ingly , non-@@ us citizens favor barack obama ’ s re-@@ election over a victory for his challen@@ ger , mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney .
there are good reasons for this .
in terms of the economy , the effects of ro@@ m@@ ney ’ s policies in creating a more unequal and divided society would not be directly felt abroad .
but , in the past , for better and for worse , others have often followed america ’ s example .
many governments quickly subscri@@ bed to ronald reagan ’ s mantra of der@@ eg@@ ulated markets – policies that eventually brought about the worst global recession since the 19@@ 30 ’ s .
other countries that followed america ’ s lead have experienced growing inequality – more money at the top , more poverty at the bottom , and a weaker middle class .
ro@@ m@@ ney ’ s proposed contra@@ c@@ tionary policies – the attempt to reduce defic@@ its pre@@ ma@@ tur@@ ely , while the us economy is still fra@@ il – will almost surely wea@@ ken america ’ s already ane@@ mic growth , and , if the euro crisis wor@@ sens , it could bring on another recession .
at that point , with us demand shrinking , the rest of the world would indeed feel the economic effects of a ro@@ m@@ ney pres@@ iden@@ cy quite directly .
that raises the question of globalization , which ent@@ a@@ ils concer@@ ted action on many fron@@ ts by the international community .
but what is required with regard to trade , finance , climate change , and a host other areas is not being done .
many people attribute these failures partly to an absence of american leadership .
but , while ro@@ m@@ ney may su@@ mm@@ on bra@@ va@@ do and strong rhetoric , other world leaders would be unlikely to follow him , o@@ wing to the belief ( correct in my judgment ) that he would take the us – and them – in the wrong direction .
american “ excep@@ tion@@ alism ” may sell well at home , but it does poorly abroad .
president george w. bush ’ s iraq war – arguably a viol@@ ation of international law – showed that though america spends almost as much on defense as the rest of the world combined , it could not paci@@ fy a country with less than 10 % of its population and less than 1 % of its gdp .
moreover , it turned out that us-@@ style capitalism was neither efficient nor stable .
with most americans ’ incomes stag@@ nat@@ ing for a decade and a half , it was clear that the us economic model was not delivering for most citizens , whatever official gdp data said .
indeed , the model blew up even before bush left office .
together with the ab@@ uses of human rights under his administration , the great recession – the predictable ( and predicted ) consequence of his economic policies – did as much to wea@@ ken america ’ s soft power as the wars in iraq and afghanistan did to wea@@ ken the credi@@ bility of its military power .
in terms of values – namely , the values of ro@@ m@@ ney and his running mate , paul ryan – things are not much better .
for example , every other advanced country recognizes the right to accessible health care , and obama ’ s affordable care act represents a significant step toward that goal .
but ro@@ m@@ ney has criticized this effort , and has offered nothing in its place .
america now has the distinction of being among the advanced countries that afford the least equality of opportunity to their citizens .
and ro@@ m@@ ney ’ s dra@@ stic budget cu@@ t@@ backs , targeted at the poor and middle class , would further im@@ pe@@ de social mobility .
at the same time , he would expand the military , spending more money on weapons that do not work against enemies that do not exist , enrich@@ ing defense contra@@ ctors like hal@@ li@@ bur@@ ton at the expense of desperately needed public investment in infrastructure and education .
while bush is not on the bal@@ lot , ro@@ m@@ ney has not really distan@@ ced himself from the bush administration ’ s policies .
on the contrary , his campaign has fe@@ atu@@ red the same advis@@ ers , the same devo@@ tion to higher military spending , the same belief that tax cuts for the rich are the solution to every economic problem , and the same fuzzy budget math .
consider , for example , the three issues that are at the center of the global agenda mentioned earlier : climate change , financial regulation , and trade .
ro@@ m@@ ney has been silent on the first , and many in his party are “ climate deni@@ ers . ”
the world cannot expect genuine leadership from ro@@ m@@ ney there .
as for financial regulation , while the recent crisis has high@@ ligh@@ ted the need for stri@@ c@@ ter rules , agreement on many issues has proven to be elu@@ sive , partly because the obama administration is too close to the financial sector .
with ro@@ m@@ ney , though , there would be no distance at all : metaphor@@ ically speaking , he is the financial sector .
one financial issue on which there is global agreement is the need to close down offshore bank ha@@ vens , which exist mainly for purposes of tax ev@@ asion and avoi@@ dance , money la@@ under@@ ing , and corruption .
money does not go to the ca@@ y@@ man islands because sunshine makes it grow faster ; this money thri@@ ves on the absence of sunshine .
but , with ro@@ m@@ ney un@@ apo@@ lo@@ ge@@ tic about his own use of ca@@ y@@ man banks , we are unlikely to see progress even in this area .
on trade , ro@@ m@@ ney promises to launch a trade war with china , and to de@@ clare it a currency manipul@@ ator on day one – a promise that gives him little wi@@ g@@ gle room .
he ref@@ uses to note the ren@@ min@@ bi ’ s large real appreciation in recent years , or to acknowledge that , while changes in china ’ s exchange rate may affect the bil@@ ateral trade deficit , what matters is america ’ s multi@@ lat@@ eral trade deficit .
a stronger ren@@ min@@ bi would simply mean a switch in the us from china to lower@@ -@@ cost producers of tex@@ tiles , appar@@ el , and other goods .
the irony – again lost on ro@@ m@@ ney – is that other countries are acc@@ using the us of currency manipulation .
after all , one of the main benefits of the federal reserve ’ s policy of “ quantitative e@@ asing ” – perhaps the only channel with a significant effect on the real economy – deri@@ ves from the de@@ preci@@ ation of the us dollar .
the world has a lot riding on america ’ s election .
unfortunately , most people who will be affected by it – almost the entire world – will have no influence on the outcome .
why shoot down r@@ yan@@ air ?
competition policy is the european union &apos;s biggest success .
the reason is simple : decisions in this area have been removed from the jur@@ is@@ di@@ ction of individual nations , thus making them more difficult to influence .
the result is that the many lob@@ bies that op@@ pose increased competition , or fight to protect state aid , have been hugely weak@@ ened .
but has the anti-@@ trust fight gone too far ?
the executive powers that the european commission enjo@@ ys over competition policy allow it to circum@@ vent the national ve@@ toes and com@@ promises that are common in other areas .
for example , imple@@ mentation of rules gover@@ ning the single market are subject to a un@@ anim@@ ity rule , or at the very least a qualified majority of member states , with the result that progress is usually slow .
the european commission recently lost much of its standing in the eyes of ordinary europeans with the vi@@ tri@@ oli@@ c fights between the council and the commission over the de@@ fun@@ ct stability p@@ act and the failure to appro@@ ve the dra@@ ft constitution .
so it is vital that the commission &apos;s reputation in the area of competition policy shine because this reputation is the union &apos;s most precious capital ; this is no time to waste it .
however , exc@@ essive ze@@ al and pursuit of cases with du@@ bi@@ ous economic justi@@ fication , as has sometimes happened in mer@@ ger cases , can do serious damage .
those who argue for the protection of state aid , for instance , immediately use an unfortunate decision in the mer@@ ger area : see , they say , how stupid the commission is at economics !
examples of this include the decisions to ve@@ to the mer@@ ger between air@@ tours and first choice , and also between te@@ tra la@@ val and si@@ del - decisions that where based on du@@ bi@@ ous arguments and were eventually rever@@ sed by the european court of justice , with serious damage to the commission &apos;s credi@@ bility .
the recent decision to fine r@@ yan@@ air , europe &apos;s main budget airline , for its arrangement with local officials in using char@@ ler@@ o@@ i as its main airport in bel@@ gi@@ um , is another example of an unfortunate decision that could under@@ mine the commission &apos;s reputation .
here are the facts : char@@ ler@@ o@@ i was a small du@@ sty airport with less than 200,000 passengers per year .
r@@ yan@@ air proposed a deal : the airport for@@ goes its landing fees , and in exchange r@@ yan@@ air flies in two million people per year .
the deal was signed and almost everybody was happy : passengers who fly cheap@@ ly ; the airport , where the number of shops increased along with the number of passengers ; the local community , where new jobs were created .
the unhappy exceptions , of course , were the big airlines that charge ten times as much as r@@ yan@@ air and were losing business .
state-@@ owned , said brus@@ sels ?
then fore@@ going landing fees is t@@ ant@@ amount to giving r@@ yan@@ air state aid - the presum@@ ption being that the lost revenue must be coming at the expense of bel@@ gian taxpa@@ yers .
so the commission asked r@@ yan@@ air to pay back most of the for@@ gone fees , and announced that it will review the airline &apos;s terms of operation at other european airports as well .
the outcome may well be the de@@ mise of r@@ yan@@ air .
michael o &apos;@@ lear@@ y , the ceo of r@@ yan@@ air , is a visionary .
in an interview last summer , he depic@@ ted a world in which people would fly free and airlines would charge airports in exchange for the millions of passengers they deliver to their shops .
this is the best possible world for passengers , since nobody forces anyone to spend money in an airport ; people do it only because it is convenient .
even leaving aside this vision , r@@ yan@@ air succeeded in providing cheap far@@ es in a european travel market that not long ago was prohi@@ bi@@ tively expensive .
r@@ yan@@ air has been a champion of increasing competition in the airline industry , forcing other carri@@ ers to reduce far@@ es .
pun@@ ishing this airline will only reduce competition in the airline industry , an outcome that , mari@@ o mon@@ ti , the eu competition commission@@ er , and lo@@ yo@@ la de pal@@ aci@@ o , the eu transport commission@@ er , cannot possibly want .
obviously , one may object that if the commission lo@@ wers its guard on state aid once , then &quot; everything may go . &quot;
so how can the commission distinguish between cases ?
our answer is that there should be a presum@@ ption that state aid to any industry or specific company must be subject to prohi@@ bi@@ tion .
this simple principle should guide commission competition decisions .
only in exceptional cases can this presum@@ ption be over@@ turned .
r@@ yan@@ air is probably one of these exceptional cases .
after all , there was a far better solution than pun@@ ishing the airline : force bel@@ gi@@ um to priva@@ tise the airport .
once private , char@@ ler@@ o@@ i airport could sign any agreement it wishes , with r@@ yan@@ air or any other airline .
here , however , we hit a soft spot : european treaties protect competition , but are neutral vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis state ownership of companies .
brus@@ sels cannot force a member country to priva@@ tize : it can only force it to run a state-@@ owned company as if it were a private corporation .
this is difficult , because getting rid of the implic@@ it guarantee enjoyed by a state-@@ owned company is virtually impossible .
dra@@ f@@ ters of the next rendi@@ tion of the european constitution should take notice .
long live china ’ s slow@@ down
new haven – at 7.@@ 7 % , china ’ s annual gdp growth in the first quarter of this year was slower than many expected .
while the data were hardly devastating relative to a consensus forecast of 8.@@ 2 % , many ( including me ) expected a second con@@ secu@@ tive quar@@ ter@@ ly re@@ bound from the slow@@ down that appeared to have ended in the third quarter of 2012 .
china doub@@ ters around the world were quick to po@@ un@@ ce on the number , expressing fears of a stall , or even a dre@@ aded double dip .
but slower gdp growth is actually good for china , provided that it reflects the long-@@ awa@@ ited structural transformation of the world ’ s most dynamic economy .
the broad out@@ lines of this transformation are well known – a shift from ex@@ port@@ - and invest@@ ment-@@ led growth to an economic structure that draws greater support from domestic private consumption .
less well known is that a re@@ balanced china should have a slower growth rate – the first hin@@ ts of which may now be evident .
a re@@ balanced china can grow more slowly for one simple reason : by drawing increased support from ser@@ vic@@ es-@@ led consumer demand , china ’ s new model will embrace a more labor@@ -@@ intensive growth recipe .
the numbers seem to bear that out .
china ’ s services sector requires about 35 % more jobs per unit of gdp than do manufacturing and construction – the primary drivers of the old model .
that number has potentially huge implications , because it means that china could grow at an annual rate in the 7-@@ 8 % range and still achieve its obje@@ ctives with respect to employment and poverty reduction .
china has struggled to at@@ tain these goals with anything less than 10 % growth , because the old model was not generating enough jobs per unit of output .
as chinese manufacturing moved up the value chain , firms increasingly replaced workers with machines embo@@ dying the latest technologies .
as a result , its economic model spa@@ wned a labor@@ -@@ saving , capit@@ al-@@ intensive growth dynamic .
on one level , that made sense .
but it left china in a dee@@ pen@@ ing hole : increasingly defi@@ cient in jobs per unit of output , it needed more units of output to absorb its surplus labor .
the old manufacturing model , which fu@@ eled an unprecedented 20-@@ fold increase in per capita income relative to the early 1990 ’ s , also so@@ wed the seeds of exc@@ essive resource consumption and environmental degradation .
ser@@ vic@@ es-@@ led growth is , in many ways , the antidote to the “ unstable , un@@ balanced , un@@ coordinated , and ultimately unsustainable ” growth model that former premi@@ er wen ji@@ ab@@ ao ’ s famously criticized in 2007 .
yet services offer more than just a labor@@ -@@ intensive growth path .
compared to manufacturing , they have much smaller resource and carbon footprints .
a ser@@ vic@@ es-@@ led model provides china with an alternative , environmentally friend@@ lier , and ultimately more sustainable economic structure .
it is premature , of course , to conclude that a ser@@ vic@@ es-@@ led transformation to slower growth is now at hand .
the latest data hint at such a possibility , with the ter@@ ti@@ ary sector ( services ) expanding at an 8.@@ 3 % annual rate in the first quarter of this year – the third con@@ secu@@ tive quarter of acceleration and a half-@@ percentage point faster than the 7.@@ 8 % first-@@ quarter gain recorded by the secondary sector ( manufacturing and construction ) .
but it will take more than a few quarters of mil@@ dly encouraging data to vali@@ date such an important shift in the chinese economy ’ s underlying structure .
not surprisingly , china skep@@ tics are putting a different spin on the latest growth numbers .
fears of a sha@@ dow@@ -@@ bank@@ -@@ induced credit bubble now top the worry list , rein@@ forcing long@@ standing concerns that china may suc@@ cum@@ b to the dre@@ aded “ middle-@@ income trap ” – a sustained growth slow@@ down that has ens@@ nar@@ ed most high-@@ growth emerging economies at the jun@@ c@@ ture that china has now reached .
china is hardly immune to such a possibility .
but it is unlikely to occur if china can carry out the ser@@ vic@@ es-@@ led pro-@@ consumption re@@ balancing that remains the core strategic initiative of its current ( 12th ) five-@@ year plan .
inv@@ ari@@ ably , the middle-@@ income trap aff@@ li@@ cts those emerging economies that cling to ear@@ ly-@@ stage development models for too long .
for china , the risk will be highest if it sticks with the ti@@ me@@ wor@@ n recipe of un@@ balanced manufactur@@ ing@@ - and construc@@ tion-@@ led growth , which has created such serious sustainability problems .
if china fails to re@@ balance , weak external demand from a cris@@ is-@@ bat@@ tered developed world will continue to ho@@ bble its export machine , forcing it to up the ante on a credi@@ t@@ - and invest@@ ment-@@ led growth model – in effect , doubling down on resour@@ ce-@@ intensive and environmentally dama@@ ging growth .
but i remain hopeful that china ’ s new leadership team will move quickly to implement its new model .
there are no viable alternatives .
financial markets , as well as grow@@ th-@@ star@@ ved developed economies , are not thrilled with the natural rhythm of slower growth that a re@@ balanced chinese economy is likely to experience .
resource industries – indeed , resour@@ ce-@@ based economies like australia , canada , brazil , and russia – have become addicted to china ’ s old strain of unsustainable hyper-@@ growth .
yet china knows that it is time to break that dangerous habit .
the united states is likely to have a different problem with consu@@ mer-@@ led growth in china .
after all , higher private consumption impli@@ es an end to china ’ s surplus saving – and thus to the seemingly open-@@ ended recycling of that surplus into dollar-@@ based assets such as us treas@@ ury bills .
who will then fund america ’ s budget deficit – and on what terms ?
just as china must embrace slower growth as a natural consequence of its re@@ balancing imperative , the rest of the world will need to figure out how to cope when it does .
mil@@ an – until recently , relatively little attention was paid to states ’ balance sheets .
measurement and reporting were negle@@ cted .
even today , states ’ li@@ abilities receive consider@@ able attention , while their asset sides receive significantly less .
in an earlier era , states owned substantial industrial assets .
this “ command@@ ing heights of the economy ” model was rejected largely because it seriously under-@@ performed , especially when state-@@ owned sectors were protected from competition ( as was the norm ) .
but , more important , the absence of entry and exit by firms , a key ingredient of innovation , caused dynam@@ ism to suffer and losses to grow over time .
the model ’ s short@@ com@@ ings led to priva@@ tization in many developed and developing countries .
in europe , priva@@ tization was viewed as a key step in the integration process .
the theory , in europe and elsewhere , was that states could not be im@@ partial owners of industrial assets .
through regulation , public pro@@ cu@@ rement , and hidden subsidies , they would favor their own assets .
of course , state ownership is not the only way to im@@ pe@@ de efficiency and dynam@@ ism .
regulations in a range of countries , from japan to italy , create sectors that are shel@@ tered from competition , with de@@ tri@@ mental effects on productivity .
this pattern is particularly pronoun@@ ced in the non-@@ tra@@ dable sectors ( which account for two-thirds of the economy ) , where the discipline of foreign competition is ab@@ sent by definition .
even here , foreig@@ n-@@ based domestic competitors could improve performance .
it is important that more attention is now paid to public li@@ abilities – not only growing sovereig@@ n debt , but also larger , non-@@ debt li@@ abilities embedded in soci@@ al-@@ insurance programs .
a combination of defe@@ ctive growth models , rising longevity , and un@@ anticipated increases in costs ( such as health care in america ) have caused these lon@@ ger-@@ term li@@ abilities to explode .
rein@@ ing in debt and other li@@ abilities has substan@@ tially reduced governments ’ scope for sustaining demand in the face of severe negative sho@@ cks , thus reducing their ability to buy time for structural adju@@ st@@ ment in the private sector .
shifting consumption to investment via tax increases is possible , but too problematic politically , with the bur@@ den-@@ sharing issue usually leading to im@@ pas@@ se and in@@ action .
meanwhile , the asset side of states ’ balance sheets remains largely invisible .
states own land , mineral rights , and infrastructure .
some have sovereig@@ n wealth funds .
many have public pension funds of substantial magnitude , consi@@ sting of diversi@@ fied portfoli@@ os of assets .
these assets are , in a sense , spoken for – there are claims on them in the form of li@@ abilities , which have grown as expected ris@@ k-@@ adju@@ sted returns on assets decline ; but they do represent a partial funding of public li@@ abilities and are an element of resilience .
by contrast , in china , the asset side of the state balance sheet is very large : land , foreig@@ n-@@ currency reserves of $ 3.5 trillion , and around an 85 % stake in state-@@ owned enter@@ pris@@ es that account for about 40 % of output .
this bal@@ ance@@ -@@ sheet configuration has helped china to respond to sho@@ cks and sustain high levels of publi@@ c-@@ sector investment .
the li@@ ability side will expand as social insurance grows – but slowly , o@@ wing to a fear of under@@ esti@@ mating the li@@ abilities being created .
in the best case – without a sharp decline in financial assets accelerating an economic down@@ turn , a sudden collapse of a defe@@ ctive growth model , or even rapid increases in li@@ abilities associated with demographic shifts or heal@@ th-@@ care technology – it might make sense to focus only on controlling li@@ abilities .
but a best-@@ case scenario provides a poor policy framework in our im@@ perfect world .
in fact , states are routinely called upon to deal with a wide range of market failures or limitations : unsustainable growth patterns and regul@@ atory myo@@ pi@@ a ; distribu@@ tional problems associated with the evolution of technology and globalization ; accelerating concentration of national income ; and major structural transi@@ tions associated with sho@@ cks and secular trends in technology and the global economy .
here is the dilemma : governments with substantial assets have flexibility and the capacity to act , but they can also mis@@ manage their assets to the de@@ tri@@ ment of markets and economic dynam@@ ism .
in china , where the asset side of the balance sheet is large , the strategy of shrinking it via priva@@ tization has been largely rejected , at least for now .
the loss of resilience would be too great .
that leads to the challenge of effective management of public assets – management that promotes rather than im@@ pe@@ des market efficiency and innovation .
here , what might be called the pension / sovereig@@ n-@@ weal@@ th-@@ fund model – in which a public entity holds and manages a diversi@@ fied portfolio of assets as a financial investor with appropriately speci@@ fied du@@ ties and governance – seems to be the right way to go .
the asset side of the balance sheet is main@@ tained in the aggregate , but the management of the assets , particularly the diversi@@ fication of hol@@ dings , can be thought of as p@@ ru@@ dent and de fac@@ to priva@@ tized .
for developed countries , increasing resilience and flexibility over time by building public assets should be a long-term priority .
periodic systemic risk affects entire economies and public finan@@ ces , not only financial markets , and governments should be able to respond during periods of rapid structural change .
in practice , this means two things .
first , once a collective choice is made about the des@@ ired levels of social insurance , the impli@@ ed li@@ abilities should be fully funded over time .
the alternative is a poor inter@@ gener@@ ational bur@@ den-@@ sharing choice .
second , governments , like individuals , households , and businesses , need to save for a rain@@ y day .
that is all the more important in periods – like the current one – of rapid change , high vola@@ tili@@ ty , and only partly predictable systemic inst@@ ability .
why talk to iran ?
washington , dc – june 12 marks the first anniversary of mahmoud ah@@ ma@@ din@@ eja@@ d ’ s dispu@@ ted re-@@ election as iran ’ s president .
meanwhile , the crisis over iran ’ s nuclear program is escal@@ ating .
the iranian regime continues to de@@ fy the international community ’ s efforts to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons .
in response , us president barack obama ’ s administration has been working through the united nations security council to impose tougher economic san@@ ctions . nonetheless , iran edges toward master@@ ing the process of enrich@@ ing uranium to weapon@@ s-@@ grade puri@@ ty .
the closer iran gets to developing a nuclear weapon , the greater the likelihood that israel , with or without us help , might attack iran ’ s nuclear facilities .
the iranian government ’ s in@@ transi@@ gence , its blat@@ ant efforts to mis@@ lead nuclear in@@ spec@@ tors , its o@@ dious calls for the destruction of israel , its brutal repres@@ sion of political oppon@@ ents – all provide good reason for obama to sla@@ m the door shut on dialogue .
with diplomacy having failed to cur@@ b iran ’ s nuclear ambi@@ tions , cri@@ tics of engagement charge , it is time to resort to co@@ er@@ cion before iran cros@@ ses the nuclear ru@@ bi@@ con .
a rising chor@@ us of voices now for@@ swe@@ ars engagement with iran ’ s rul@@ ers , insi@@ sting that it is time for the regime to go .
but closing off dialogue with iran would be a precipit@@ ous and dangerous mistake .
as my new book , how enemies become friends , con@@ firms , even fier@@ ce adver@@ sar@@ ies can settle their differences through negotiation .
for four compelling reasons , the us and its allies should keep the door open to dialogue until the el@@ event@@ h hour .
first , ti@@ ghter san@@ ctions make sense only as a diplo@@ matic tool , not as a bl@@ unt instrument of co@@ er@@ cion .
the new san@@ ctions simply are not severe enough to intimi@@ date iran into sub@@ mission , and more restri@@ ctive ones would not pass muster within the security council .
accor@@ d@@ ingly , if tougher san@@ ctions prove to be useful , they will do so by confron@@ ting iran with a united diplo@@ matic front , thereby encouraging its government to make a deal in order to end the country ’ s isolation .
new san@@ ctions are war@@ ran@@ ted , but as a comple@@ ment , not an alternative , to diplomacy .
second , the costs of aband@@ oning diplomacy are so high that continued engagement makes sense even as iran ref@@ uses to bu@@ dge .
to give up on diplomacy is to leave the international community with two ugly options : living with a nuclear iran or carrying out a pre@@ ven@@ tive military strike against iran ’ s nuclear installations .
should iran poss@@ ess the ultimate weapon , it might embrace a new restra@@ int in its foreign policy ; nu@@ clear@@ -@@ weapons states , precisely because they confront the prospect of nuclear re@@ tali@@ ation , have historically tre@@ ad with caution .
but the iranian regime is no ordinary government ; it may not ad@@ here to the normal practices of nuclear restra@@ int .
even if it does , a nuclear iran may trigger an arms race in the region and em@@ bol@@ den an iranian government that already supports extrem@@ ist movements throughout the middle east .
an american security umbr@@ ella over the persi@@ an gulf and israel might calm nerves , but it would do little to counter increased iranian support of islamic radi@@ cals .
a military strike would likely have worse consequences .
even if a strike was an operational success , it would only set back iran ’ s nuclear program by several years – while giving the regime a new incentive to acquire a nuclear de@@ terr@@ ent and build better hidden and defen@@ ded nuclear facilities .
in response to an attack , iran might well seek to ob@@ stru@@ ct shipping in the persi@@ an gulf , potentially trig@@ gering oil shor@@ tages and so@@ aring prices .
and it could launch attacks on us , european , and israeli targets on a global basis .
such pro@@ spe@@ cts make continued diplomacy , however elu@@ sive the pro@@ spe@@ cts of success , nothing short of mand@@ atory .
the third reason for pursuing dialogue is that fac@@ tional in@@ fighting and political intri@@ gue within the iranian regime make for consider@@ able political fluidi@@ ty .
admit@@ tedly , tur@@ mo@@ il in tehran brings in@@ con@@ stan@@ cy to iran ’ s foreign policy , war@@ ran@@ ting caution about the pro@@ spe@@ cts for a meaningful diplo@@ matic breakthrough .
but internal jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ying for power also means that a co@@ ali@@ tional alig@@ nment favor@@ ing a negoti@@ ated settlement just might fall into place .
ah@@ ma@@ din@@ eja@@ d himself , after all , late last year voic@@ ed enthusiasm for a western proposal to break the log@@ jam by expor@@ ting iran ’ s uranium for processing abroad , only to reverse course soon there@@ after . then last month , he rever@@ sed course again , working with brazil and turkey to craft a water@@ ed-@@ down version of the original proposal .
ah@@ ma@@ din@@ eja@@ d may be bo@@ b@@ bing and weaving . but his mer@@ curi@@ al ways make it plau@@ sible that he may find it politically advanta@@ geous to strike a serious bar@@ gain on the nuclear issue . just in case , the diplo@@ matic door should remain a@@ jar .
finally , even as stal@@ e@@ mate continues on iran ’ s uranium enrich@@ ment , continued engagement may offer a round@@ about means of arriving at a bar@@ gain on the nuclear issue .
dialogue with the us could focus on areas , such as iraq and afghanistan , where the two parties share a measure of common ground .
joint efforts to combat drug trafficking in afghanistan , for example , could help dil@@ ute the mutual an@@ tag@@ on@@ ism and di@@ str@@ ust that contribute to block@@ age on the nuclear front .
iran remains several years away from master@@ ing the technology needed to build nuclear weapons , which provides time to search for such diplo@@ matic open@@ ings .
with iran having spur@@ ned obama ’ s offers of compromise , it is temp@@ ting for the us administration to turn its back on dialogue .
but the stakes are too high to abandon engagement .
even with new san@@ ctions in the off@@ ing , dialogue still offers the best prospect for peac@@ efully resol@@ ving what may be the world ’ s most dangerous dispute .
why target big banks ?
london – it seemed that a new model for global governance had been for@@ ged in the white heat of the financial crisis .
but now that the ashes are cooling , different perspectives on bank regulation are emerging on either side of the atlantic .
the emphasis in europe has been on regul@@ ating financial markets with a view to moder@@ ating future crises .
credit mistakes are made during the boom , not during the crash , so the argument goes .
better regulation and mon@@ etary policy during the boom years , therefore , could limit the scale of any bust .
by contrast , the emphasis in the united states has been on finding market@@ -@@ friendly ways to contain spil@@ lovers from bank failure .
policy deb@@ ates in the us are chie@@ fly pre@@ occupied with en@@ suring that banks are never “ too big to fail ” ; that private investors rather than taxpa@@ yers hold “ cont@@ ing@@ ent capital , ” which in a crash can be converted into equity ; and that “ over-@@ the-@@ counter ” markets ’ functioning be improved through greater reli@@ ance on centralized trading , clear@@ ing , and sett@@ lements .
the chief point of intersection between the european and us approaches is major banks .
this convergence has less to do with regul@@ atory thinking on bank size or function than with a common need to play to the political gallery and raise more tax revenue .
banks ’ balance sheets are syste@@ mi@@ cally dangerous when blo@@ ated by leverage , and it is this that regul@@ atory or fiscal policy should address through liqui@@ dity buff@@ ers and leverage rati@@ os .
after all , it is the contagi@@ ousness of financial crises , not banks ’ size , that matters .
any list con@@ ju@@ red up in 2006 of institutions that were “ too big to fail ” would not have included northern rock , bra@@ d@@ ford &amp; b@@ ing@@ ley , i@@ kb , bear sterns , or even le@@ hman brothers .
banks l@@ end to banks , so while some are more il@@ liquid than others , they are all intrinsically il@@ liquid institutions .
small failures can give birth to large pan@@ ics , which means that in a crisis almost everyone is “ too big to fail . ”
the reality is that we can have as large a financial boom and subsequ@@ ent bust as we just experienced , resul@@ ting in the same economic misery , in a world made up only of small banks .
many argue that bankers ’ belief that their institutions are too big to fail and that their jobs are safe encoura@@ ges them to underestimate the risks that they assume .
but if that belief dominated bankers ’ thinking , they would still worry about their savings .
in other words , they would not wrap themselves up in their institutions ’ equity and the lever@@ aged products they were selling .
yet they did .
the revealed preference of banks ’ and bankers ’ behavior is that they did not l@@ end more because they thought they could get away with it , but because they thought it was safe .
they were fo@@ ols more than kna@@ ves .
the main driver of exc@@ essive len@@ ding and leverage is a mista@@ ken view of risk that is shared by everyone .
the riski@@ est institutions were not the largest : firms like j. p. morgan and h@@ s@@ bc proved safer than others , and neither sought nor needed state funding .
those that failed were relatively small , like i@@ kb , bear sterns , and so on .
big banks like the idea that regulation should care less about banks ’ size and more about their ris@@ kin@@ ess , and so champion a “ ris@@ k-@@ sensitive ” approach – not least because they have the bigger ris@@ k-@@ management operations and databases , so ris@@ k-@@ sensitive regulation is more on@@ er@@ ous for their smaller competitors .
but this approach suffers from a fatal fall@@ acy : if booms are fu@@ eled by under@@ esti@@ mation of risks , and regulation is made more sensitive to the esti@@ mation of risks , booms will be bigger and bu@@ sts deeper .
a better argument for cur@@ bing bank size is the exc@@ essive influence of big banks on policy@@ .@@ what policymakers should therefore be looking for is regulation that makes the financial system less sensitive to error in markets ’ esti@@ mation of risk , not more so .
there are two ways to do this .
the first is to observe that this error is correlated with the boom@@ -@@ bust cycle .
booms have similar characteristics – strong growth in banks ’ balance sheets and credit , and therefore a rise in leverage .
these trends imp@@ ly an increased probability that the market is under@@ esti@@ mating risk , so systemic risk regul@@ ators should raise minimum capital requirements as soon as they spot them .
counter-@@ cycli@@ cal capital requirements fit with this idea , and a range of indi@@ cators could be used to cali@@ brate the increase in capital requirements , coupled perhaps with some discre@@ tion .
there are many reasons why the market fails to correct systemic error , including that booms are always founded on a belief by both regul@@ ators and bankers that “ this time it is different . ”
let ’ s not forget the es@@ says in central banks ’ stability reports on how credit deriva@@ tives were benef@@ iting the financial sector .
the second way to reduce the financial system ’ s sensitivity to ris@@ k-@@ esti@@ mation errors is to limit the flow of risks to institutions with a structural , rather than a statistical , capacity for holding that risk .
that way , when the risk model@@ ers get it wrong , we will be in less trouble .
credit risk is best he@@ dged through diversi@@ fication across un@@ correlated credi@@ ts .
liqui@@ dity risk is best he@@ dged through diversi@@ fication across time .
market risk is best he@@ dged through a combination of diversi@@ fication across assets and enough time to decide when to sell .
in the past , risks with vola@@ tili@@ ty of similar statistical magni@@ tudes were considered to be fun@@ gible , and , could flow to wh@@ om@@ ever was prepared to bear them .
but , while banks with short-term funding and many branches origin@@ ating loans have a deep capacity for holding credit risks , they have a limited capacity for holding market risks , and little capacity for holding liqui@@ dity risk .
the lesson for regul@@ ators is simple : capacity for risk is related to the ma@@ turi@@ ty of funding , not to what an institution is called .
brus@@ sels – as europe picks over the ruins of the mega-@@ mer@@ ger that would have created a world-@@ beating new aero@@ space and defense giant , questions are being asked about the ing@@ l@@ ori@@ ous role that the european union played in the fi@@ as@@ co .
the european commission ’ s failure to champion the $ 50 billion mer@@ ger of the fran@@ co-@@ german european aer@@ on@@ au@@ tic def@@ ence and space company ( e@@ ads ) , owner of air@@ bus , and the united kingdom ’ s ba@@ e systems is being seen as a crucial factor in the deal ’ s collapse .
the integration of the two high-tech aviation and avi@@ onics leaders had looked like an eu@@ -@@ inspired blueprint for industrial success .
for several years , eu leaders have been ur@@ ging the con@@ soli@@ dation of europe ’ s defense industries , so the proposed deal – which origin@@ ated in the corporate boar@@ dro@@ oms of e@@ ads and ba@@ e systems – looked like an answer to their calls .
yet both the commission and the european parliament kept silent and with@@ held the political support that might have en@@ su@@ red that the deal went through .
a tim@@ ely reminder by eu leaders of the strategic importance of the aero@@ space sector would have helped al@@ lay many of the mis@@ gi@@ v@@ ings in berlin , and to a lesser degree in london , that ultimately sank the deal .
aviation , like defense , is the shar@@ pest of the r &amp; d cutting edges available to advanced countries , and regularly produces key technological breakthroughs .
nation@@ alist squ@@ ab@@ bles over the details of the mer@@ ger would surely have been atten@@ u@@ ated by a stat@@ es@@ man@@ like intervention from the commission in brus@@ sels .
it was therefore a bizarre coincidence that the mer@@ ger ’ s collapse came on the day that the commission unvei@@ led its new industrial strategy for re@@ gaining europe ’ s competitive edge in the face of asian and north american competition .
one of the most powerful arguments for the e@@ ad@@ s-@@ ba@@ e marriage had been the expectation of industry analy@@ sts that within 20 years china will challenge air@@ bus and boeing in the global aviation market , while also creating a powerful new defense industry .
that scenario now looks all the more likely .
why , then , did the european commission remain silent ?
the answer appears to be that it fe@@ ared negative reactions from the three governments involved in the mer@@ ger talks , and believed that its own authority would suffer from any public re@@ bu@@ ff .
the persistent ru@@ mor circul@@ ating among defense company execu@@ tives is that soon after news of the proposed mer@@ ger le@@ aked , the weekly commission@@ ers ’ meeting cha@@ ired by commission president jo@@ s@@ é manuel bar@@ ro@@ so was enjo@@ ined to keep silent on the matter in order to avoid any potential dangers .
whether true or not , the important point is that the mer@@ ger transc@@ ended national consider@@ ations , and the european commission had a duty to involve itself .
the eu ’ s executive body is meant to be the driving force behind europe ’ s efforts to revi@@ ve lag@@ g@@ ard industries and fight to reverse the long-term economic decline that the euro@@ zone crisis appears to pres@@ age .
nobody is arguing that the commission is responsible for the deal ’ s unhappy end – only that it should have ral@@ lied support for it .
the significance of the mer@@ ger ’ s collapse is now becoming clear to obser@@ vers across europe , especially in germany , where the media have been extremely critical of how “ negative politics ” sealed the proposed mer@@ ger ’ s fate .
with the eu in the thro@@ es of the seemingly endless euro@@ zone sovereig@@ n-@@ debt crisis and facing a lo@@ oming debate over its future decision-making architecture , the collapse of the e@@ ad@@ s-@@ ba@@ e mer@@ ger will be no more than a foot@@ note in the history books .
but it may be said to mark the point when the european commission open@@ ly acknowled@@ ged that it has become little more than a secre@@ tari@@ at to eu governments .
that is a far cry from the political power@@ house that some europeans fear – and for which others still hope .
should central banks target employment ?
washington , dc – on december 12 , us federal reserve chair@@ man ben ber@@ nan@@ ke announced that the fed will keep interest rates at close to zero until the unemployment rate falls to 6.@@ 5 % , provided inflation expectations remain sub@@ du@@ ed .
while the fed ’ s gover@@ ning stat@@ utes , unlike those of the european central bank , explicitly include a mandate to support employment , the announcement marked the first time that the fed tied its interest@@ -@@ rate policy to a numer@@ ical employment target .
it is a welcome breakthrough , and one that should be em@@ ulated by others – not least the ec@@ b .
central banks ’ stat@@ utes differ in terms of the obje@@ ctives that they set for mon@@ etary policy .
all include price stability .
many add a reference to general economic conditions , including growth and employment or financial stability .
some give the central bank the authority to set an inflation target un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally ; others sti@@ pu@@ late coordination with the government in setting the target .
there is no recent example , however , of a major central bank setting a numer@@ ical employment target .
this should change , as the size of the employment challenge facing the advanced economies becomes more apparent .
weak labor markets , low inflation , and debt over@@ hang suggest that a fundamental re-@@ or@@ dering of priorities is in order .
in japan , sh@@ in@@ z@@ o abe , the in@@ coming prime minister , is sign@@ aling the same set of concerns , although he seems to be proposing a “ minimum ” inflation target for the bank of japan , rather than a link to growth or employment .
the spread of global valu@@ e-@@ chains that integrate hundreds of millions of develop@@ ing-@@ country workers into the global economy , as well as new labor@@ -@@ saving technologies , imp@@ ly little chance of cost-@@ push wage inflation .
likewise , the market for long-term bonds indicates extremely low inflation expectations ( of course , interest rates are higher in cases of perceived sovereig@@ n default or re-@@ den@@ om@@ ination risk , such as in southern europe , but that has nothing to do with inflation ) .
moreover , the dele@@ ver@@ aging underway since the 2008 financial im@@ plo@@ sion could be easier if inflation were moder@@ ately higher for a few years , a debate the international mon@@ etary fund encouraged a year ago .
together with these consider@@ ations , policymakers should take into account the tremendous human and economic costs of high unemployment , ranging from the millions of shat@@ tered lives , skills erosion , and disappe@@ ar@@ ance of opportunities for an entire generation , to the dead@@ -@@ weight loss of id@@ le human resources .
is the failure to ensure that millions of young people acquire the skills required to participate in the economy not as great a li@@ ability for a society as a large stock of public debt ?
nowhere is this re@@ or@@ dering of priorities more needed than in the euro@@ zone .
yet , strangely , it is the fed , not the ec@@ b , that has set an unemployment target .
the us unemployment rate has declined to around 7.@@ 7 % and the curr@@ ent-@@ account deficit is close to $ 500 billion , while euro@@ zone unemployment is at a record high , near 12 % , and the current account shows a surplus approaching $ 100 billion .
if the ec@@ b ’ s inflation target were 3 % , rather than close to but below 2 % , and germany , with the world ’ s largest curr@@ ent-@@ account surplus , encouraged 6 % wage growth and toler@@ ated 4 % inflation – im@@ plying modest real-@@ wage growth in excess of expected productivity gains – the euro@@ zone adju@@ st@@ ment process would become less politically and economically costly .
indeed , the policy calculus in northern europe greatly under@@ estimates the economic losses due to the disrup@@ tions imposed on the south by exc@@ essive au@@ ster@@ ity and wage def@@ lation .
the resul@@ ting high levels of youth unemployment , health problems , and id@@ le production capacity also all have a substantial impact on demand for impor@@ ts from the north .
contrary to conventional wisdom , the ec@@ b ’ s legal mandate would allow such a re-@@ or@@ dering of priorities , as , with reference to the ec@@ b , the treaty on the functioning of the european union states that “ the primary ( emphasis added ) objective of the european system of central banks … shall be to maintain price stability , ” and there is another part of the treaty dealing with general euro@@ zone economic policies that emphasi@@ zes employment .
this would seem not to pre@@ clu@@ de a temporary comple@@ mentary employment objective for the ec@@ b at a time of exceptional challenge .
moreover , the ec@@ b has the authority to set the euro@@ z@@ one-@@ wide inflation target , and could set it higher for two or three years , without any treaty viol@@ ation .
the real problem is the current political attitude in germany .
somehow , the memory of hyper@@ inflation in the early 19@@ 20 ’ s seems sc@@ ari@@ er than that of massive unemployment in the early 19@@ 30 ’ s , although it was the lat@@ ter that fu@@ eled the rise of naz@@ ism .
maybe the up@@ coming german elections will allow progressive forces to clari@@ fy what is at stake for germany and europe – indeed , the entire world .
in a more global context , none of this is to dis@@ miss the lon@@ ger-@@ term dangers of inflation .
in most countries , at most times , inflation should be kept very low – and central banks should an@@ chor inflation expectations with a stable long-term target , although the alternative of targe@@ ting nomin@@ al gdp deserves to be discussed .
moreover , mon@@ etary policy cannot be a long-term substitute for structural reforms and sustainable budgets .
long periods of zero real interest rates carry the danger of asset bubbles , mis@@ allo@@ cation of resources , and unintended effects on income inequality , as recent history – not least in the us and japan – demonstrates .
for the coming 2-@@ 3 years , however , particularly in europe , the need for dele@@ ver@@ aging , the costs of widespread job@@ lessness , and the risk of social collapse make the kind of temporary unemployment target announced by the fed highly des@@ ir@@ able .
china ’ s american bail@@ out ?
zur@@ ich – the twenty-@@ first-@@ century economy has thus far been shaped by capital flows from china to the united states – a pattern that has supp@@ ressed global interest rates , helped to ref@@ late the developed world ’ s leverage bubble , and , through its impact on the currency market , fu@@ eled china ’ s meteor@@ ic rise .
but these were no ordinary capital flows .
rather than being driven by direct or portfolio investment , they came primarily from the people ’ s bank of china ( p@@ bo@@ c ) , as it a@@ mas@@ sed $ 3.5 trillion in foreign reserves – largely us treas@@ ury se@@ curi@@ ties .
the fact that a single institution wi@@ el@@ ds so much influence over global macro@@ economic trends has caused consider@@ able anxiety , with do@@ om@@ sa@@ yers predicting that doub@@ ts about us debt sustainability will force china to sell off its hol@@ dings of us debt .
this would drive up interest rates in the us and , ultimately , could trigger the dollar ’ s collapse .
but selling off us treas@@ ury se@@ curi@@ ties , it was argued , was not in china ’ s interest , given that it would drive up the ren@@ min@@ bi ’ s exchange rate against the dollar , dimin@@ ishing the domestic value of china ’ s reserves and under@@ mining the export sector ’ s competi@@ tiveness .
indeed , a us defense department report last year on the nation@@ al-@@ security implications of china ’ s hol@@ dings of us debt concluded that “ attemp@@ ting to use us treas@@ ury se@@ curi@@ ties as a co@@ er@@ ci@@ ve tool would have limited effect and likely would do more harm to china than to the &#91; us &#93; . ”
to describe the symbio@@ tic relationship between china ’ s ex@@ port-@@ led gdp growth and america ’ s exc@@ essive consumption , the economic histori@@ ans ni@@ all fer@@ gus@@ on and mor@@ it@@ z schul@@ ar@@ ick coined the term “ chim@@ er@@ ica . ”
the inv@@ oc@@ ation of the chim@@ era of greek mythology – a mon@@ strous , fi@@ re-@@ breathing am@@ alg@@ am of lion , goat , and dra@@ gon – makes the term all the more appropriate , given that chim@@ er@@ ica has generated massive and terrifying distor@@ tions in the global economy that cannot be correc@@ ted without serious consequences .
in 2009 , these distor@@ tions led fer@@ gus@@ on and schul@@ ar@@ ick to forecast chim@@ er@@ ica ’ s collapse – a prediction that seems to be coming true .
with the reserves ’ long-term effects on china ’ s internal economic dynamics finally taking hold , selling off foreig@@ n-@@ exchange reserves is now in china ’ s interest .
over the last decade , the vast quantities of short-term capital that were being pump@@ ed into china ’ s banking system drove commercial banks and other financial institutions to expand credit substan@@ tially , especially through the sha@@ dow@@ -@@ banking system , leading to a massive credit bubble and severe over-@@ investment .
in order to manage the resul@@ ting increase in risk , china ’ s new leaders are now ref@@ using to provide further liqui@@ dity inje@@ ctions , as well as cur@@ bing loans to un@@ profitable sectors .
but these efforts could trigger a financial crisis , requ@@ ir@@ ing china to initi@@ ate a major recap@@ it@@ alization of the banking system .
in such a scenario , non-@@ performing loans in china ’ s banking system would probably amount to roughly $ 1 trillion .
the most obvious means of recap@@ itali@@ zing china ’ s banks would be to inject ren@@ min@@ bi@@ -@@ denomin@@ ated government debt into the banking sector .
but china ’ s total public debt , including off-@@ bal@@ ance@@ -@@ sheet lo@@ cal@@ -@@ government finan@@ cing vehicles , probably amounts to around 70 % of gdp already .
despite debate over the details , the conclusion of carmen rein@@ hart and kenne@@ th ro@@ go@@ ff – that a high debt / gdp ratio can inhi@@ bit economic growth – remains widely accepted ; so it is unlikely that raising the debt ratio to 100 % would be in china ’ s long-term interest .
even if china ’ s leaders decided that they had the necessary fiscal la@@ titude to pursue such a strategy , they probably would not , o@@ wing to the risk of inflation , which , perhaps more than any other economic variable , tends to lead to social un@@ rest .
fortunately for china , the negative consequences of such a move would probably be far less severe than previously thought .
to be sure , an injection of us treas@@ u@@ ries into the banking sector , and their subsequ@@ ent con@@ version to ren@@ min@@ bi , would still streng@@ then china ’ s currency .
but the rise would most likely be off@@ set by capital out@@ flows , as loo@@ ser capital controls would enable sa@@ vers to escape the financial crisis .
moreover , even if the ren@@ min@@ bi became stronger in the short term , china is no longer as dependent on maintaining export competi@@ tiveness as it once was , given that , exclu@@ ding assembly and re@@ processing , exports now contribute less than 5 % of china ’ s gdp .
against this background , the us federal reserve , rather than focusing only on “ ta@@ per@@ ing ” its monthly purch@@ ases of long-term se@@ curi@@ ties ( quantitative e@@ asing ) , must prepare itself for a potential sell@@ -@@ off of us debt .
given that a fe@@ d-@@ funded recap@@ it@@ alization of china ’ s banking system would ne@@ gate the impact of mon@@ etary policy at home , driving up borrowing costs and im@@ pe@@ ding gdp growth , the fed should be ready to sustain quantitative e@@ asing in the event of a chinese financial crisis .
after spending years attemp@@ ting to insu@@ late the us economy from the up@@ shot of its own banking crisis , the fed may ultimately be forced to ba@@ il out china ’ s banks , too .
this would fundamentally redefine – and , one hopes , re@@ balance – us-@@ china relations .
why the fed should post@@ pone rate hi@@ kes
jackson hole , wy@@ oming – as central bankers from around the world gather this week in jackson hole for the federal reserve ’ s annual economic policy sym@@ posi@@ um , one key topic of discussion will be the current global stock@@ -@@ market tur@@ mo@@ il .
there are many reasons for these gy@@ rations , but the expectation that the fed will start to raise interest rates – perhaps as early as september – is clearly one of them .
the arguments for a rate hi@@ ke are valid .
the united states ’ economy is gaining tra@@ ction .
the international mon@@ etary fund fore@@ ca@@ sts 3 % annual growth in 2015 and 20@@ 16 , accompanied by inflation rates of 0.@@ 1 % and 1.5 % , respe@@ ctively .
when an economy is norm@@ alizing , it is reasonable to reduce expan@@ sion@@ ary measures , such as those introduced after the crisis of 2008 .
because the fed has clearly communic@@ ated that it will move gradually toward less expan@@ sion@@ ary policies , its credi@@ bility would be damaged if it did not follow through .
but there are strong reasons for the fed to post@@ pone interest@@ -@@ rate hi@@ kes and to keep mon@@ etary policy expan@@ sion@@ ary over the coming quarters .
for star@@ ters , the us recovery remains weak .
historically , 3 % growth during a recovery is far from impressive .
in other recent reco@@ ver@@ ies , growth often hit 4 % or even 5 % when increased capacity utili@@ zation pushed up productivity and investment .
over the past three decades , the us has been able to grow at an average annual rate of around 2.5 % .
some attribute relatively slow growth to demographic factors , which have reduced the labor force , as well as to weak productivity levels , which have been low .
but america ’ s potential output may be under@@ estimated , and its inflation pro@@ pen@@ sity exagger@@ ated .
the us labor market works well .
unemployment is down to 5 % , with no signs of over@@ heating .
the employment cost index suggests that wage increases so far have been surprisingly low .
one reason for this is that labor@@ -@@ market flexibility increased during the recovery .
self-@@ employment , short-term contracts , or part@@ -@@ time arrangements account for many of the jobs that have been created over the past few years .
full-time jobs with comprehensive benefits are now much rar@@ er .
this ongoing “ u@@ beri@@ zation ” of the us labor market means that the balance in the wa@@ ge-@@ setting process has shifted .
as a result , it will take longer for demand to feed through to wages and inflation than in the past .
moreover , the economy is under@@ going an ongoing technological shift ste@@ mming from digi@@ tization and globalization .
estimates from citi@@ group indicate that almost half of all jobs will be disrup@@ ted in the coming decades .
jobs that require lower skills and less training are particularly vulnerable ; but it is also clear that many other occupa@@ tional categories – including administration , accounting , logi@@ stics , banking , and various service activities – are likely to be affected .
companies will be able to reduce their head@@ count and production costs while improving customer service , which , like u@@ beri@@ zation , will affect the wa@@ ge-@@ setting process .
central bankers , i believe , are under@@ esti@@ mating the impact of this structural shift .
in the more tech-@@ oriented economies , like the us , the united kingdom , and the nor@@ dic countries , there is a risk that traditional macro@@ economic models will over@@ estimate the cost pressure from labor .
another reason why the fed should post@@ pone a rate hi@@ ke is that financial tur@@ mo@@ il in emerging markets , particularly china , could have a substantial impact on the global economy , with some clear implications for the us economy .
in particular , lower energy and commodity prices are likely to dam@@ pen infla@@ tionary pressure .
when inflation is low for a long period , inflation expectations also tend to be low .
add falling commodity and energy prices to the mix and there is a risk that inflation expectations will remain too low to sustain a balanced recovery .
the global implications of lower emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market curren@@ cies are also likely to be de@@ fla@@ tionary .
the direct impact is that a stronger dollar reduces the cost of impor@@ ted goods .
the indi@@ rect effect , which might be substantial , is that cost-@@ competitive light manufacturing in emerging markets increases .
that would rein@@ force the de@@ fla@@ tionary pressure from globalization for years to come .
there is also a risk of greater curren@@ cy@@ -@@ market vola@@ tili@@ ty if the fed jumps the gun in raising rates .
but , because they floo@@ ded global markets with liqui@@ dity , large portfolio flows have moved into emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market countries , whose curren@@ cies often are not as liquid as the dollar .
when investment moves back into dollars , the currency fluctuations in these less liquid markets can become exc@@ essive .
the fed clearly has a responsibility to consider how its policy decisions affect the global financial system .
exc@@ essive currency vola@@ tili@@ ty is not in america ’ s interest , not least because large ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate de@@ preci@@ ations in emerging markets would ampli@@ fy the effects of globalization on us jobs , wages , and inflation , particularly as weaker foreign curren@@ cies make outsour@@ cing a more economically viable solution .
another reason for the fed to re@@ consider hi@@ king rates is that the legiti@@ macy of the brett@@ on woods institutions depends on a well-@@ functioning global financial system .
the global economy ’ s center of gravity is moving to asia , latin america , and africa , but the imf and the world bank still seem to mirror the reality of the 1950s .
if the fed is seen as unle@@ ash@@ ing a major crisis in emerging markets , this will almost certainly do long-term damage to the global financial system .
the fed should regard lower commodity prices , reduced infla@@ tionary pressures , changes in the labor market , and further disruptive technological shifts as suffici@@ ently convincing arguments to post@@ pone a rate hi@@ ke .
including the risk of exc@@ essive vola@@ tili@@ ty in the global financial system tips the balance even further .
there is plenty of time for the fed to signal that its policy stance has shifted , and the con@@ cla@@ ve in jackson hole is an excellent opportunity to start that communication .
if the facts have changed , the policy implications must also change .
the greatest loss of credi@@ bility always comes when policymakers try to ignore changing realities .
why the greek bail@@ out failed
even if negoti@@ ators overcome the most recent sticking points , it will be difficult to trust in their imple@@ mentation if the greek people remain un@@ convinced .
that has certainly been the experience so far .
and without structural reform , there is little chance that the greek economy will see sustained stability and growth – not least because official len@@ ders are un@@ willing to continue extending an un@@ re@@ formed greece significantly more money than it is asked to pay . ( this has been the case through most of the crisis , even if one would never know it from the world press coverage . )
greece ’ s mem@@ ber@@ ship in the european union gives its credi@@ tors significant leverage , but evi@@ dently not enough to change the fundamental calculus .
greece remains very much a sovereig@@ n country , not a sub-@@ sovereig@@ n state .
the “ tro@@ i@@ ka ” of credi@@ tors – the international mon@@ etary fund , the european central bank , and the european commission – simply do not enjoy the kind of leverage over greece that , say , the munici@@ pal assistance corporation wi@@ el@@ ded over new york city when it tee@@ tered on the edge of bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy in the mid-@@ 1970s .
the best struc@@ tur@@ al-@@ adju@@ st@@ ment programs are those in which the deb@@ tor country ’ s government pro@@ poses the policy changes , and the imf helps design a bes@@ poke program and provides the political cover for its imple@@ mentation .
im@@ posing them from the outside is simply not an effective option .
so , for reforms to take hold , the greek government and its elec@@ tor@@ ate must believe in them .
that a country must take ownership of its reform program is not a new lesson .
the imf ’ s rocky relationship with ukra@@ ine began long before the latest round of negotiations .
back in 2013 , imf staff wrote a sober@@ ing report on the organization ’ s experience in the country .
their conclusion , in essence , was that the government ’ s failure to embrace the reform process fully all but guaranteed that its program would not work .
if a government is in@@ capable of or un@@ interested in making the needed adju@@ st@@ ments , the report argued , the best option is to drip money out as reforms are implemented , as is now being done in greece .
unfortunately , that approach has not proved adequate to overcome the challenges there .
struc@@ tur@@ al-@@ reform conditions often ti@@ lt the balance between competing domestic fac@@ tions , for better or for worse .
if there is no will inside the country to maintain the reforms , they will quickly be under@@ min@@ ed .
left-@@ wing ide@@ olo@@ gues have long viewed struc@@ tur@@ al-@@ reform programs with deep suspi@@ cion , acc@@ using international len@@ ders like the imf and the world bank of being captured by neo@@ liberal market fundament@@ alists .
this cri@@ ti@@ que has some truth in it , but is over@@ blown .
to be sure , structural reforms often favor policies like labor@@ -@@ market flexibility .
but one should not make the mistake of viewing these interventions in black@@ -and-@@ white terms .
breaking down du@@ al labor markets that are exclu@@ ding young workers ( as they do in much of southern europe , including italy and , to some extent , france ) is very different from making it easier to fire all workers .
making pension systems sustainable does not amount to making them stin@@ gier .
making tax systems simpler and fair@@ er is not the same as raising all taxes .
recently , oppon@@ ents of structural reform have put forward more exotic obje@@ ctions – most not@@ ably the problem caused by def@@ lation when policy interest rates are at zero .
if structural reforms simply lower all wages and prices , it may indeed be difficult in the short-term to counter the drop in aggregate demand .
but a similar cri@@ ti@@ que could be made of any other change in policy : if it is poorly designed , it will be counter-@@ productive .
the truth is that the way forward in europe requires achieving greater productivity .
the lessons from greece and other un@@ successful bail@@ out programs are sober@@ ing .
if a debt bail@@ out program requires a wh@@ oles@@ ale change in a country ’ s economic , social , and political model , the best course of action might be to write off the private losses , rather than pour in public money to cover them .
in cases like greece , the credi@@ tors ’ passion for structural reforms might be better directed at home – particularly toward improving financial regulation .
the vast majority of greeks want to stay in the eu .
in an ideal world , offering financial aid in exchange for reforms might help those in the country who want to shape it into a modern european state .
but given the difficulty greece has had so far in making the necessary changes to reach that goal , it might be time to re@@ consider this approach to the crisis completely .
in place of a program providing the country with further loans , it might make more sense to provide ou@@ tri@@ ght humanitarian aid – regardless of whether greece remains fully within the euro@@ zone .
why the greek deal will work
london – now that greek banks have re@@ opened and the government has made scheduled payments to the european central bank and the international mon@@ etary fund , does greece ’ s near-@@ death experience mark the end of the euro crisis ?
the conventional answer is a clear no .
according to most economists and political comm@@ ent@@ ators , the latest greek bail@@ out was little more than an anal@@ ges@@ ic .
it will dul@@ l the pain for a short period , but the euro ’ s deep-@@ se@@ ated problems will metast@@ asi@@ ze , with a dis@@ mal progno@@ sis for the single currency and perhaps even the european union as a whole .
but the conventional wisdom is likely to be proved wrong .
the deal between greece and the european authorities is actually a good one for both sides .
rather than mar@@ king the beginning of a new phase of the euro crisis , the agreement may be remembered as the cul@@ min@@ ation of a long series of political com@@ promises that , by correc@@ ting some of the euro ’ s worst design flaws , created the conditions for a european economic recovery .
to express guar@@ ded optimism about the greek deal is not to con@@ done the provo@@ cative arrogan@@ ce of former greek finance minister yan@@ is var@@ ou@@ fa@@ kis or the poin@@ tless v@@ indic@@ tiveness of german finance minister wolf@@ gang sch@@ äu@@ ble .
neither is it to deny the economic criticism of the bail@@ out pro@@ visions presented by progressi@@ ves like joseph stig@@ li@@ tz and conservatives like h@@ ans@@ -@@ wer@@ ner sinn .
the arguments against creating a european single currency and then allowing greece to cheat its way into mem@@ ber@@ ship were valid back in the 1990s – and , in theory , they still are .
but this does not mean that breaking up the euro would be des@@ ir@@ able , or even toler@@ able .
joining the euro was certainly ru@@ in@@ ous for greece , but there is always “ a great deal of ruin in a nation , ” as adam smith re@@ marked 250 years ago , when losing the american colonies seemed to threaten britain with financial deva@@ station .
the great virtue of capitalism is that it adap@@ ts to ru@@ in@@ ous conditions and even finds ways of turning them to advantage .
the united states in the mid-@@ n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth century was badly su@@ ited for a single currency and a single economic structure , as eviden@@ ced by the civil war , which was provo@@ ked as much by single-@@ currency ten@@ sions as by moral ab@@ horr@@ ence to slavery .
italy would probably be better off today if g@@ ari@@ bal@@ di had never launched uni@@ fication .
but once uni@@ fication has happened , the pain of dis@@ man@@ tling the political and economic settlement usually overwhel@@ ms the apparent gains from a break@@ -up .
this seems to be the case in europe , as clear maj@@ orities of voters are saying in all euro@@ zone countries , including germany and greece .
thus , the question was never whether the single currency would break up , but what political rever@@ s@@ als , economic sacrifi@@ ces , and legal sub@@ ter@@ fu@@ ges would occur to hold it together .
the good news is that europe now has some persu@@ asive answers .
indeed , europe has overcome what could be described as the “ original sin ” of the single-@@ currency project : the ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht treaty ’ s prohi@@ bi@@ tion of “ mon@@ etary finan@@ cing ” of government defic@@ its by the ec@@ b and the related ban on mutual support by national governments of one another ’ s debt bur@@ dens .
in january , ec@@ b president mari@@ o dra@@ gh@@ i effectively side@@ stepped both obstacles by launching a program of quantitative e@@ asing so enormous that it will finance the entire defic@@ its of all euro@@ zone governments ( now including greece ) and mu@@ tu@@ alize a significant proportion of their out@@ standing bonds .
moreover , european governments have bel@@ at@@ edly understood the most basic principle of public finance .
government deb@@ ts never have to be re@@ paid , provided they can be extended in a cooperative manner or bought up with newly created money , issued by a credible central bank .
but for this to be possible , interest payments must always be made on time , and the sanc@@ ti@@ ty of debt contracts must always take prece@@ dence over elec@@ toral promises regar@@ ding pen@@ sions , wages , and public spending .
now that prime minister alexis t@@ si@@ pr@@ as ’ s government has been forced to acknowledge the un@@ qualified priority of debt servi@@ cing , and can now benefit from unlimited mon@@ etary support from the ec@@ b , greece should have little problem supporting its debt burden , which is no hea@@ vier than japan ’ s or italy ’ s .
finally , germany , spain , italy , and several northern european countries required , for domestic political reasons , a ritual humili@@ ation of radical greek politicians and voters who open@@ ly de@@ fied eu institutions and au@@ ster@@ ity demands .
having achieved this , eu leaders have no further reason to impose au@@ ster@@ ity on greece or strictly en@@ force the terms of the latest bail@@ out .
instead , they have every incentive to demonstrate the success of their “ tough love ” policies by e@@ asing au@@ ster@@ ity to accelerate economic growth , not only in greece but throughout the euro@@ zone .
this raises a key issue that the t@@ si@@ pr@@ as government and many others mis@@ understood throughout the greek crisis : the role of construc@@ tive hypo@@ cris@@ y in europe ’ s political economy .
gaps between public statements and private intentions open up in all political systems , but these become huge in a complex multinational structure like the eu .
on paper , the greek bail@@ out will impose a fiscal ti@@ ghten@@ ing , thereby ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ating the country ’ s economic sl@@ um@@ p .
in practice , however , the budget targets will surely be allowed to slip , provided the government carries out its promises on priva@@ tization , labor markets , and pension reform .
these structural reforms are much more important than fiscal targets , both in symbolic terms for the rest of europe and for the greek economy .
moreover , the extension of ec@@ b mon@@ etary support to greece will transform financial conditions : interest rates will plum@@ met , banks will recap@@ it@@ alize , and private credit will gradually become available for the first time since 2010 .
if budget targets were strictly en@@ forced by bail@@ out monit@@ ors , which seems unlikely , this improvement in conditions for private bor@@ ro@@ wers could easily compen@@ sa@@ te for any modest ti@@ ghten@@ ing of fiscal policy .
in short , the main conditions now seem to be in place for a sustainable recovery in greece .
conventional wisdom among economists and investors has a long record of failing to spot major turning points ; so the near-@@ universal belief today that greece faces permanent depression is no reason to despair .
trans@@ atlantic free trade ?
ma@@ dri@@ d – this month , the united states national intelligence council released a sober@@ ing report entitled global trends 2030 : alternative worlds .
most important , according to the authors , if current trends continue , asia could soon sur@@ pass north america and europe in global power .
it will have a higher gdp , larger population , higher military spending , and more technological investment .
in this geo@@ political context , europe and the us need each other more than ever , making greater trans@@ atlantic cooperation crucial .
this seems to be the approach that inspired out@@ going us secretary of state hillary clinton ’ s recent speech at the bro@@ ok@@ ings institution on us-@@ european relations .
given the shift in global power and the prospect of us energy self-@@ suffici@@ ency as domestic hydro@@ carbon output booms , america is trying to adapt its foreign policy to the new multi-@@ polar international order .
and , although asia is now america ’ s strategic priority , europe is still the partner with which americans have the most in common .
“ i want to be clear , ” clinton not@@ ed .
“ our re@@ orientation toward asia is not a with@@ dra@@ wal from europe . ”
the us , according to clinton , hopes that europe will follow suit , so that asia is seen not only as a market , but also as a focus of common strategic action .
but , beyond that , as the us and europe seek to ensure their global roles , cooperation between them is more important than ever .
so now is the time for a bold initiative : the launch of a us-@@ european union free-@@ trade agreement .
clinton has already hin@@ ted at america ’ s read@@ iness for this , men@@ tioning the possibility of negotiating a complete agreement that would increase trade and stimulate growth on both sides of the atlantic .
the journalist david ig@@ na@@ ti@@ us even dar@@ ed to give it a name in a recent article in the washington post : ta@@ ft@@ a ( trans@@ atlantic free-@@ trade agreement ) .
edward lu@@ ce , writing in the financial times , preferred “ trans@@ atlantic partnership . ”
the us and the eu ( taken as a whole ) are not only the world ’ s two largest economies and typically the largest commercial partners for other major economies ; they also maintain the world ’ s largest bil@@ ateral trade relationship .
american investment in europe is three times higher than it is in asia .
european investment in the us is eight times larger than its investments in china and india combined .
so trans@@ atlantic trade is crucial for both economies , particularly for job creation .
indeed , it is estimated that one-third of all bil@@ ateral us-@@ eu trade consists of internal transfers by companies that operate in both markets .
although us and eu tari@@ ffs on each other ’ s market@@ ed manufactured goods are already low ( below 3 % , on average ) , a free-@@ trade agreement would be enormously beneficial in promoting further investment , thereby boo@@ sting economic growth and creating more jobs .
such an agreement could include trade in goods , services , financial instruments , and agriculture , and would necessi@@ tate greater compati@@ bility of european and american regulations and legal norms , im@@ plying substantial savings .
moreover , the effects of such an agreement would be felt far beyond the us and europe .
for example , both have already signed free-@@ trade treaties with various latin american countries , im@@ plying the creation of a geographi@@ cally enormous free-@@ trade area , which should boost economic resilience in the face of global crisis .
indeed , regional free-@@ trade agre@@ ements are gaining momentum worldwide .
the trans@@ -@@ pacific partnership , a free-@@ trade agreement spe@@ ar@@ headed by the us , is set to be a gam@@ e-@@ chan@@ ger in the asi@@ a-@@ pacific region , with decisi@@ ve advances this year putting it on course to be concluded in 2015 .
potential sig@@ nat@@ ories include the us , australia , malaysia , vietnam , singapore , new zealand , chile , peru , brun@@ ei , canada , mexico , and perhaps japan and south korea .
the result will be trade liber@@ alization in an area that produces 40 % of global gdp .
isn ’ t it time to consider something similar for europe and the us ?
the eu , now confron@@ ting a wave of popu@@ li@@ sm and euro@@ -@@ skep@@ ticism , could revi@@ ve its sense of purpose by commit@@ ting itself to closer trans@@ atlantic cooperation and coordination on trade , to be carried out by the european commission .
such a project has worked before in bringing europe together ; it can do so again .
the most precious asset today is confidence , and the mere fact of launching negotiations would generate it in abundance .
prote@@ c@@ tion@@ ism is no solution to the crisis , whereas a trans@@ atlantic free-@@ trade agreement would favor multi@@ lat@@ er@@ alism and openness .
in this sense , it is important to stress the work of the world trade organization , the best multi@@ lat@@ eral forum that the world has for resol@@ ving trade dispu@@ tes .
signing a trans@@ atlantic trade treaty would be ir@@ refu@@ table proof that the political case for open trade can be made – and won .
the only way to achieve this is through the clear commitment of political leaders on both sides of the atlantic , together with privat@@ e-@@ sector involvement , which is fundamental to sustaining ur@@ gently needed economic growth .
but let ’ s not wait : faced with predictions of the west ’ s relative decline , the us and the eu must commit themselves to more union , more cooperation , and more prosperity .
today , that means a trans@@ atlantic free-@@ trade agreement .
financial reform ’ s breakthrough year
z@@ an@@ zi@@ bar – here ’ s an odd prediction for the coming year : 2013 will be a water@@ shed for financial reform .
true , while the global financial crisis erup@@ ted more than four years ago , and the dod@@ d-@@ frank financial reforms were adopted in the united states back in 2010 , not much has changed about how wall street operates – except that the large firms have become bigger and more powerful .
yet there are reasons to expect real progress in the new year .
the us federal reserve is finally shifting its thinking .
in a series of major speeches this fall , governor dan tar@@ ul@@ lo made the case that the problem of “ too big to fail ” financial institutions remains with us .
we need to take additional measures to reduce the level of systemic risk – including limit@@ ing the size of our largest banks .
news reports indicate that the fed has already started saying no to some bank mer@@ gers .
at the same time , the us federal depos@@ it insurance corporation has become a ba@@ stion of sensible thinking on finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ sector issues .
in part , this is because the f@@ dic is responsible for cleaning up the mess when finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ sector firms fail , so its senior officials have a strong incentive to protect its insurance fund by preventing risks from getting out of control .
the f@@ dic is showing intellectual leadership as well as organi@@ zational capabilities – vice chair@@ man tom ho@@ en@@ ig ’ s speeches are a mu@@ st-@@ read .
wall street is pushing back , of course .
but the rolling series of sc@@ and@@ als surrounding global megab@@ an@@ ks makes it difficult for anyone to keep a straight face when execu@@ tives insist that our largest banks must maintain their current scale and scope .
do we need h@@ s@@ bc to facili@@ tate global money la@@ under@@ ing ?
do we need bar@@ cla@@ ys and u@@ bs to manipulate li@@ bor ( a key bench@@ mark for interest rates around the world ) ?
do we need still more losses at poorly run trading operations for j@@ p morgan chase ?
the pro-@@ bank lobby groups are posi@@ tioning themselves to argue that the new resolution powers under dod@@ d-@@ frank have ended the to@@ o-@@ big@@ -to-@@ fail problem , and we can expect a publi@@ c-@@ relations drive in this direction early in the new year .
but the consensus view at the most recent meeting of the f@@ dic ’ s systemic resolution advis@@ ory committee ( of which i am a member ) was that this claim should not be taken seriously .
under dod@@ d-@@ frank , it is arguably easier for the f@@ dic to handle the failure of a single large financial institution than it was in pre-@@ dod@@ d-@@ frank days .
but what if two or three or seven firms are all in trouble at the same time ?
the answer , as former fed chair@@ man paul vol@@ cker impli@@ ed at the meeting , is that we would be right back where we started – in the panic and frozen credit markets that followed the collapse of le@@ hman brothers in september 2008 .
indeed , the idea that substantial sho@@ cks could soon hit the us financial system is not far-@@ fe@@ tched .
the european debt crisis , for example , remains far from being resolved .
a significant sovereig@@ n-@@ debt re@@ struc@@ turing there would bring down european banks and potentially damage us banks – as well as financial institutions around the world .
meanwhile , the continuing problems at european banks are a stark reminder that operating highly lever@@ aged , thin@@ ly capit@@ alized firms is incredibly risky .
and the regul@@ atory failures in europe – consider the german landes@@ banks , for example – will become only more obvious in the coming months .
creating a common super@@ vis@@ ory authority will mean nothing unless it can clean up the mess created by the existing super@@ vis@@ ors .
and that clean@@ up will expose more of the rot in banks ’ current operations .
the need for banks to finance themselves with more equity and relatively less debt will be the focus of one of the main publishing events in economics in 2013 . an@@ at ad@@ mat@@ i and martin hell@@ wig ’ s the bankers ’ new clothes : what ’ s wrong with banking and what to do about it ? will appear officially in march , but advance copies are already being closely read in leading central banks .
bankers everywhere will rush to read it before their regul@@ ators do .
the road to the ongoing financial and economic crisis was built on a foundation of intellectual capture : not only regul@@ ators , but academics , too , became cap@@ tiv@@ ated by modern finance and its methods .
ad@@ mat@@ i and hell@@ wig are at the van@@ guard of the counter@@ revolution , challenging the great myths of banking head-@@ on .
do we need financial institutions to be so highly lever@@ aged ( that is , carrying so much debt relative to equity ) ?
no , they argue .
if banks of all kinds were finan@@ ced with more equity , they would have stronger buff@@ ers to absorb losses .
both the equity and the debt issued by well-@@ capit@@ alized banks would be safer – and therefore cheaper .
bankers want to be so highly lever@@ aged for a simple reason : implic@@ it government guarante@@ es mean that they get the upside when things go well , while the down@@ side is someone else ’ s problem .
contrary to bankers ’ claims , this is not a good arrangement for society .
ad@@ mat@@ i and hell@@ wig are confron@@ ting the bankers and their allies in no un@@ certain terms , gro@@ unding their argument in deep financial thinking , yet writing for a broad audience .
whatever else happens in 2013 , we can be sure that they will not win the goldman sachs business book of the year award .
in defense of non-@@ vision@@ aries
oxford – many of the recent tribu@@ tes for margaret th@@ at@@ cher following her death celebrated her as a “ transformational ” leader who brought about great changes .
there were frequent references to her equally transformational american counter@@ part , ronald reagan .
but a more interesting comparison is with her other presidential contemporary , george h. w. bush .
though often dis@@ missed as a mere “ trans@@ ac@@ tional ” manager , bush had one of the best foreig@@ n-@@ policy records of the past half-@@ century .
his administration managed the end of the cold war , the dis@@ man@@ t@@ lement of the soviet union , and the uni@@ fication of germany within nato – all without violence .
at the same time , he led a broad united nation@@ s-@@ backed coalition that rep@@ elled saddam hussein ’ s aggression against kuwait .
had he dropped any of the balls he was juggling , today ’ s world would be much worse .
although he presi@@ ded over a major global transformation , bush , by his own account , did not have transformational obje@@ ctives .
on the uni@@ fication of germany , he resi@@ sted the advice of th@@ at@@ cher and others , apparently out of a sense of fairness and responsi@@ veness to his friend , german chan@@ cell@@ or hel@@ mut ko@@ hl .
in october 1989 , bush responded to a call from ko@@ hl by publicly stating that he did not “ share the concern that some european countries have about a re@@ unified germany . ”
at the same time , he was careful to let ko@@ hl and others take the lead .
when the berlin wall was opened a month later , partly o@@ wing to an east german mistake , bush was criticized for his low-@@ key response .
but bush had made a deliber@@ ate choice not to humili@@ ate the so@@ vie@@ ts or glo@@ at : “ i won ’ t beat on my chest and dance on the wall , ” was his response – a model of emotional intelligence in a leader .
such self-@@ restra@@ int helped to set the stage for the successful mal@@ ta summit with soviet president mik@@ ha@@ il gor@@ bach@@ e@@ v a month later .
the cold war ended quietly , and the dis@@ man@@ t@@ lement of the soviet empire followed .
as bush and his team responded to forces that were largely outside of his control , he set goals and obje@@ ctives that balanced opportunities and constraints in a p@@ ru@@ dent manner .
but , in each instance , bush was limit@@ ing his short-term gains in order to pursue long-term stability .
other cri@@ tics complained that bush did not set more transformational obje@@ ctives regar@@ ding russian democracy , the middle east , or nuclear non-@@ proliferation at a time when world politics seemed fluid .
but , again , bush remained more focused on maintaining global stability than on advan@@ cing new visions .
bush was also respectful of institutions and norms at home and abroad , going to the us congress for auth@@ ori@@ zation of the gulf war , and to the united nations for a resolution under chapter 7 of the un charter .
although a re@@ alist in his thinking , he could be wil@@ son@@ ian in his tactics .
bush ’ s termin@@ ation of the ground war in iraq after only four days was motivated in part by humanitarian concerns about the s@@ laughter of ira@@ qi troops , as well as by an interest in not leaving iraq so weak@@ ened that it could not balance the power of neighbor@@ ing iran .
while bush ’ s invasion of pan@@ ama to capture ( and later put on trial ) manuel nor@@ ie@@ ga may have viol@@ ated pan@@ am@@ anian sovereig@@ n@@ ty , it had a degree of de fac@@ to legiti@@ macy , given nor@@ ie@@ ga ’ s not@@ ori@@ ous behavior .
and , when bush organized his international coalition to pro@@ sec@@ ute the gulf war , he included several arab countries – not to ensure military success , but to boost the mission ’ s legiti@@ macy .
when bush and th@@ at@@ cher met in aspen , colorado , in the summer of 1990 , th@@ at@@ cher alle@@ ge@@ dly war@@ ned him “ not to go wo@@ b@@ bly . ” but most histori@@ ans agree there was no such danger .
with his careful combination of hard and soft power , bush created a successful strategy – one that accomplished american goals in a manner that was not un@@ du@@ ly insul@@ ar and with minimal damage to the interests of foreig@@ ners .
he was careful not to humili@@ ate gor@@ bach@@ e@@ v , and to manage the transition to bor@@ is yel@@ ts@@ in ’ s pres@@ iden@@ cy in a newly independent russia .
of course , not all foreig@@ ners were adequ@@ ately protected .
for example , bush assigned a low priority to kur@@ ds and shi@@ a in iraq , to dissi@@ dents in china , and to bos@@ ni@@ ans in the former yu@@ gosla@@ via .
in that sense , bush ’ s re@@ alism set limits to his co@@ smo@@ poli@@ tan@@ ism .
could bush have done more had he been a transformational leader like th@@ at@@ cher or reagan ?
perhaps he might have done more in a second term .
and , with better communication skills , he might have been able to do more to educate the american public about the changing nature of the post-@@ cold war world .
but , given the profound uncertainty of a world in flu@@ x , as well as the dangers of mis@@ calculation as the soviet empire collapsed , p@@ ru@@ dent management trum@@ ped grand visions .
nonetheless , few people at the end of 1989 believed that germany could be re@@ united peac@@ efully within the western alliance .
th@@ at@@ cher certainly did not .
the lesson is that in some circumstances , we should prefer leadership by good trans@@ ac@@ tional managers like george h. w. bush ( or d@@ wi@@ ght eisenhower before him ) , rather than by more flash@@ y and inspirational trans@@ formers .
is europe america ’ s friend or fo@@ e ?
paris – since don@@ ald trum@@ p became us president in january 20@@ 17 , his conduct has been aston@@ ish@@ ingly er@@ ra@@ tic , but his policies have been more consistent than fores@@ een by most obser@@ vers .
trum@@ p ’ s vola@@ tili@@ ty has been dis@@ concer@@ ting , but on the whole he has acted in accor@@ dance with promises made on the campaign tra@@ il and with views held long before anyone considered his election possible .
accor@@ d@@ ingly , a new cot@@ tage industry in rational theories of trum@@ p ’ s seemingly irrational behavior has developed .
the latest challenge is to make sense of his stance towards europe .
at a r@@ ally on june 28 , he said : “ we love the countries of the european union .
but the european union , of course , was set up to take advantage of the united states .
and you know what , we can ’ t let that happen . ” during his recent trip to the continent , he called the eu “ a fo@@ e ” and said it was “ possibly as bad as china . ”
regar@@ ding bre@@ x@@ it , he declared that british prime minister ther@@ esa may should have “ sued ” the eu .
then came the tru@@ ce , on july 25 : trum@@ p and jean-@@ c@@ lau@@ de jun@@ cker , the president of the european commission , agreed to work jo@@ in@@ tly on an agenda of free trade and world trade organization reform .
so it seems we are friends again – or perhaps just re@@ sting before the dispute res@@ um@@ es .
but the deeper question remains : why has trum@@ p repeatedly attacked america ’ s oldest and most reliable ally ?
why does he seem to des@@ p@@ ise the eu so deeply ?
why should the us try to under@@ mine europe , rather than seeking closer cooperation to protect its economic and geo@@ political interests ?
trum@@ p ’ s approach is particularly striking given that china ’ s rapid emergence as a strategic ri@@ val is america ’ s main national security issue .
contrary to earlier hopes , china is conver@@ ging with the west neither politically nor economically , because the role of the state and the rul@@ ing party in coordin@@ ating activities remains far greater .
geo@@ politically , china has been actively building cli@@ ent@@ eles , most visi@@ bly through its belt and road initiative , and it inten@@ ds to “ foster a new type of international relations ” that de@@ parts from the model promot@@ ed by the us in the twen@@ tieth century .
obviously , china , not europe , is the number one challenge to us world supre@@ macy .
former president barack obama ’ s china strategy combined dialogue and pressure .
he started building two mega-@@ economic alli@@ ances that exclu@@ ded china and russia : the trans@@ -@@ pacific partnership with 11 other pacific ri@@ m countries , and the trans@@ atlantic trade and investment partnership with the european union .
but trum@@ p with@@ drew the us from the t@@ pp and killed the t@@ tip before it was born .
then he opened a trade rift with the eu .
and he has attacked both the eu and its member states , especially germany .
there are three possible explanations .
one is trum@@ p ’ s peculiar obsession with bil@@ ateral trade balances .
according to this view , trum@@ p regar@@ ds germany , the rest of europe , and china as equally threatening competitors .
nobody else thinks this makes economic sense .
and the only result he can expect from this strategy is to hurt and wea@@ ken the long-@@ standing atlantic partnership .
but he has been complaining about mer@@ ce@@ des cars in the streets of new york city at least since the 1990s .
a second explanation is that trum@@ p wants to prevent the eu from posi@@ tioning itself as the third player in a tri@@ lat@@ eral game .
if the us inten@@ ds to turn the relationship with china into a bil@@ ateral power struggle , there are good reasons for it to regard the eu as an obstacle .
because it is itself governed by law , the eu is bound to op@@ pose a purely trans@@ ac@@ tional approach to international relations .
and a united europe that commands access to the world ’ s largest market is not a trivial player .
but after the eu has been under@@ min@@ ed , if not dis@@ band@@ ed , weak and divided european countries would have no choice but to r@@ ally behind the us .
finally , a more political reading of trum@@ p ’ s behavior is that he is seeking regime change in europe .
in fact , he has not disgu@@ ised his belief that europe is “ losing its culture ” because it has let immigration “ change its fabric . ”
and stephen ban@@ non , his former chief strateg@@ ist , has announced that he will spend half of his time in europe to help build an alliance of nation@@ alist parties and win a majority in next may ’ s european parliament elections .
a few weeks ago , only the first reading looked plau@@ sible .
the other two could be dis@@ missed as fantas@@ ies inspired by conspiracy theories .
no us president had ever presented the eu as a plot to wea@@ ken the us .
indeed , all of trum@@ p ’ s post@@ war pre@@ de@@ cess@@ ors would have reco@@ iled in horror at the idea of the eu ’ s dis@@ solution .
but the us president has gone too far for europe to dis@@ miss the more dis@@ mal scenarios .
for the eu , this is a pi@@ vot@@ al moment .
in the 1950s , it was launched beneath the us security umbr@@ ella and with america ’ s blessing .
since then , it has been built as a geo@@ political experiment conducted under us protection and in the context of a us-@@ led international system .
for this reason , its external dimensions – economically , diplo@@ matically , or regar@@ ding security – have always come second to its internal development .
what the recent crisis signifi@@ es is that this is no longer true .
europe must now define its strategic stance vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis a more distant and possibly hostile us , and vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis rising powers that have no reason to be kind to it .
it must stand for its values .
and it must ur@@ gently decide what it inten@@ ds to do regar@@ ding its security and defense , its neighborhood policy , and its border protection .
this is an acid test .
economically , the eu still has the potential to be a global player .
the size of its market , the strength of its major companies , a unified trade policy , a common regul@@ atory policy , a single competition authority , and a currency that is second only to the dollar are major assets .
it could – and should – use them to push for a re@@ vam@@ ping of international relations that add@@ resses legitimate us gri@@ ev@@ ances vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis china and legitimate chinese concerns over its international role .
europe has played a leading role in fighting climate change ; it could do the same for trade , investment , or finance .
europe ’ s main problem is political , not economic . the challenge it is facing comes at a moment when it is divided between island and continent , north and south , and east and west .
and the questions posed are fundamental : what defines a nation ?
who is in charge of borders ?
who guarante@@ es security ?
is the eu based on shared values or on the pure calculus of national interests ?
if the eu fails to define itself for a world that is fundamentally different from that of ten years ago , it probably will not survive as a meaningful institution .
if it does , however , it may regain the sense of purpose and legiti@@ macy in the eyes of citizens that years of economic and political se@@ t@@ backs have ero@@ ded .
why turkey &apos;s army will stay home
just when the smoke from turkey ’ s domestic political conflicts of the past year had begun to clear , another deadly attack by kur@@ dish se@@ para@@ ti@@ sts on turkish soldiers has the government threatening military attacks inside northern iraq .
that prospect raises risks for turkey , iraq , and the united states .
but there are reasons to doubt that the situation is as dangerous as recent headlines suggest .
turkey acc@@ uses ira@@ qi kur@@ ds of harb@@ oring between 3,000 and 3,@@ 500 of turkey ’ s most active kur@@ dish mili@@ tants – the p@@ k@@ k se@@ para@@ tist guer@@ illas who are bl@@ amed for the deaths of 80 turkish soldiers so far this year .
the trouble reached the boiling point on october 7 , when kur@@ dish fighters killed 13 turkish soldiers near turkey ’ s border with iraq .
the turkish public has demand@@ ed action , and prime minister re@@ ce@@ p ta@@ y@@ yi@@ p er@@ do@@ gan ’ s government has responded .
on october 17 , despite ple@@ as for patience and restra@@ int from iraq and the us , turkish law@@ makers voted 50@@ 7-@@ 19 to auth@@ ori@@ ze er@@ do@@ gan to order cross-@@ border military strikes into iraq at any time over the next year .
er@@ do@@ gan has sent ira@@ qi kur@@ ds a for@@ ce@@ ful message .
but , for several reasons , the turkish military is likely to limit its operations to small-scale in@@ cur@@ sions and air strikes on specific targets rather than launch an all-@@ out war .
first , the turkish military has no interest in embracing the risks that come with involvement in iraq ’ s sec@@ tarian stri@@ fe .
a full-@@ scale invasion might well provo@@ ke iraq ’ s own kur@@ dish guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ as into a pro@@ lon@@ ged and bloody battle with turkish forces that can only under@@ mine support for er@@ do@@ gan ’ s government at home and abroad .
second , turkey ’ s government hopes to keep the country ’ s bid to join the european union moving forward .
an invasion of iraq would bring that process to a grin@@ ding halt .
eu foreign policy chief ja@@ vier sol@@ ana has made plain that europe strongly op@@ poses any large-scale turkish military operation in iraq .
third , turkey is well aware that an all-@@ out attack inside iraq is exactly what turkey ’ s kur@@ dish se@@ para@@ ti@@ sts want .
what better way to damage turkey than to pull its military into conflict with iraq , the us , and the eu ?
er@@ do@@ gan has no intention of being drawn into that trap .
with all that in mind , this latest move by turkey ’ s parliament should be seen more as an ulti@@ mat@@ um to iraq ’ s kur@@ dish regional government to expe@@ l the turkish kur@@ ds and an attempt to persuade the us to use its consider@@ able influence there .
that ’ s hard@@ ball politics , not a declar@@ ation of war .
the parli@@ am@@ entary auth@@ ori@@ zation itself is carefully wor@@ ded to under@@ line turkey ’ s limited aims .
it stres@@ ses that turkey ’ s military has no intention of occu@@ p@@ ying ira@@ qi territory or threatening ira@@ qi kur@@ ds or their oil infrastructure .
an attack would certainly make iraq ’ s kur@@ dish provin@@ ces less appealing for foreign investors . but turkey has no reason to attack the assets of foreign oil companies .
iraq ’ s central government is aware of the risks , as well , and is likely to exercise maximum restra@@ int .
a limited turkish strike into northern iraq would probably e@@ lic@@ it little reaction beyond public con@@ dem@@ nation and rhetor@@ ical asser@@ tions of ira@@ qi sovereig@@ n@@ ty .
threats to iraq ’ s oil infrastructure around the northern ira@@ qi city of kir@@ ku@@ k and other territory under the kur@@ dish regional government ’ s control are minimal .
turkey ’ s government knows that any move to shut down the 60@@ 0-@@ mile pipeline from kir@@ ku@@ k to turkey ’ s mediterranean port at ce@@ y@@ han would have little near-@@ term impact , since most of iraq ’ s oil exports flow from the south , hundreds of miles from the country ’ s border with turkey .
furthermore , the turkish military can increase the pressure on ira@@ qi kur@@ ds with far less dra@@ stic measures .
it can close the two countries ’ principal border crossing , an important route for food , fuel , and other goods headed for ira@@ qi kur@@ ds .
it could also cut exports of electricity to northern iraq .
still , even small-scale military operations would generate risk .
if the p@@ k@@ k is able to launch a major attack on troops or civili@@ ans inside turkey , the public out@@ cry might leave er@@ do@@ gan with little choice but to up the ante .
the issue is complicated further by turkey ’ s ref@@ us@@ al to negotiate directly with the kur@@ dish regional government in northern iraq .
such talks , turkey fears , would offer tac@@ it acknowled@@ gement that ira@@ qi kur@@ ds have won a degree of autonomy from bag@@ h@@ dad .
that ’ s a bridge too far for turkey ’ s nation@@ alists and its military .
there are risks for ira@@ qi prime minister nour@@ i al mali@@ ki as well , because turkish military strikes on iraq ’ s northern provin@@ ces could under@@ mine the kur@@ dish support on which his government increasingly depends .
both sun@@ ni arab@@ s and kur@@ ds already res@@ ent al mali@@ ki ’ s mild reaction to iran ’ s recent sh@@ elling of ira@@ qi territory – an attempt to strike at iranian kur@@ dish mili@@ tants fle@@ eing across its border with iraq .
there are also risks for the us .
most supplies headed for us troops in iraq and afghanistan move through the in@@ cir@@ li@@ k air@@ base in turkey .
with the threat that the us house of representatives will appro@@ ve a resolution that acc@@ uses tur@@ ks of genocide against ethic ar@@ men@@ ians nine decades ago , this is a particularly in@@ opport@@ une moment for the two countries to be at odds over iraq .
but , wor@@ st-@@ case scenarios aside , a turkish invasion of northern iraq can only serve the interests of turkey ’ s kur@@ dish se@@ para@@ ti@@ sts .
that ’ s why cooler heads are likely to pre@@ va@@ il .
limited cross-@@ border operations are increasingly likely . a war between turkey and ira@@ qi kur@@ ds is not .
why ukra@@ ine deserves a hair@@ cut
london – in addition to its many other trou@@ bles , ukra@@ ine now finds itself in a show@@ down with its credi@@ tors .
investors holding high-@@ yiel@@ ding bonds – many of them bought at heavy dis@@ counts after russia ’ s an@@ nex@@ ation of cri@@ me@@ a last year – are demanding to be paid in full .
ukra@@ ine ’ s government , for its part , argues that the country ’ s financial difficulties – in particular the economic effects of the conflict and the pl@@ unge in the value of the hr@@ y@@ v@@ nia – have made its debt burden unsustainable .
the outcome of this stan@@ do@@ ff could determine ukra@@ ine ’ s future , as much as the military confron@@ tation with russia .
recent developments have put the country on a path that would have been unimaginable until very recently .
for the first time in ukra@@ ine ’ s post-@@ soviet history , it has a government that is willing and able to carry out real reform .
ukra@@ ine ’ s progress , however , could not be more fragile .
without some form of debt relief , it could easily be lost .
a little over a year ago , ukra@@ ine did not have an elected president or a representative and functioning parliament .
the political landscape was deeply fragmented .
civil society had been energi@@ zed by the ma@@ i@@ dan revolution that ou@@ sted former president vi@@ ktor yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch , but it was in tur@@ mo@@ il .
debate over the association agreement with the european union , along with the russi@@ an-@@ backed rebellion in the east , had sto@@ ked ten@@ sions over distin@@ ctions that previously played little or no role in people ’ s lives .
but since parli@@ am@@ entary elections in october , ukra@@ ine has begun to pull itself together .
russia ’ s intervention has to some extent back@@ fired , streng@@ th@@ ening support for a european orientation .
eastern ukra@@ ine may have voted differently from the rest of the country , but the overwhelming majority of voters came out in favor of europe .
the elec@@ tor@@ ate also said no to the more virul@@ ent forms of nation@@ alism , leaving the right-@@ wing extrem@@ ist parties margin@@ alized .
the result of the elections was the formation of a five-@@ party gover@@ ning coalition .
though seemingly fragile , it has held up remarkably well .
some of its members have displayed worrying popu@@ list tenden@@ cies , but an analysis of parli@@ am@@ entary voting patterns indicates that so far the coalition has been able to find agreement , even on very difficult issues .
the government has , among other things , raised gas tari@@ ffs by 450 % ( from absur@@ dly low levels ) .
dis@@ sen@@ sion has been relatively moder@@ ate .
as a result , ukra@@ ine ’ s core institutions are under@@ going fundamental change .
perhaps ukra@@ ine ’ s single most important achievement is the establishment of the national reform council .
originally set up to coordinate reforms across mini@@ stries and monitor their imple@@ mentation , it has come to serve as an important tool to discuss and ensure coher@@ ence among the different branches of government .
this lat@@ ter role is particularly important , given the constitu@@ tional ambiguity created by the re@@ version back to a parli@@ am@@ entary system and the un@@ easy co-@@ habit@@ ation of president pe@@ tro po@@ ro@@ sh@@ en@@ ko and prime minister ar@@ seni@@ y y@@ at@@ sen@@ yu@@ k in government .
meetings are held every three weeks and are atten@@ ded by the president , the prime minister , and his entire cabinet , providing a forum in which ten@@ sions can be discussed and e@@ ased .
in between meetings , the council ’ s special proje@@ ct-@@ management office assi@@ sts in the preparation and imple@@ mentation of key reforms by mini@@ stries .
with support from the european bank for reconstruction and development , the george sor@@ o@@ s-@@ funded international renaissance foundation , and bil@@ ateral assistance from , among others , the swedish government , the office has been able to hire staff at market rates , raising the quality of the government administration .
ukra@@ ine ’ s government has also benef@@ ited from the expertise of privat@@ e-@@ sector leaders .
de@@ pu@@ ty head of the presidential administration d@@ my@@ tro sh@@ ym@@ ki@@ v , who drove the national reform council , was ceo of microsoft ukra@@ ine .
finance minister natalie jar@@ es@@ ko and economic development and trade minister ai@@ var@@ as ab@@ ro@@ ma@@ vi@@ ci@@ us were both investment bankers ( neither was a ukra@@ ini@@ an citizen when they joined the government ) .
infrastructure minister and@@ ri@@ y pi@@ vo@@ var@@ sky , also a former investment banker , was most recently ceo of contin@@ ium , one of the country ’ s largest holding companies .
each has played a key role in pushing the reform agenda forward , working for sal@@ aries that are orders of magnitude smaller than what they earned before .
some have even employed staff using their own money .
meanwhile , the ambitious agen@@ das of the government ministers and the presidential administration are closely monit@@ ored by an energi@@ zed civil society .
as sor@@ os has not@@ ed , ukra@@ ine probably has the most active civil society in europe .
one of the country ’ s most interesting new vent@@ ures is vo@@ x@@ ukra@@ ine , a blogging platform set up by two ukra@@ ini@@ an economics professors based in the united states , yu@@ ri@@ y gor@@ od@@ ni@@ chen@@ ko and timo@@ fi@@ y my@@ lo@@ van@@ o@@ v .
they have champi@@ oned modern eviden@@ ce-@@ based decision-making and constantly come up with new , construc@@ tive ways of challenging the government and its assumptions .
despite all this progress , however , the odds remain stac@@ ked against the country .
the government is fighting at least two wars simultaneously – taking on a deeply ent@@ ren@@ ched oli@@ g@@ archy , while trying to f@@ end off its hostile eastern neighbor .
further trouble – in the form a steep@@ ly declining economy – is something it cannot afford .
the stakes could not be higher .
for the first time since the country gained its independence in 1992 , ukra@@ ine has a clear sense of direction and a government capable of supporting reform .
there are signs that the oli@@ g@@ arch@@ s ’ grip is beginning to loo@@ sen , o@@ wing partly to internal conflicts among them .
the eu and the us are working to help resolve its conflict with russia .
ukra@@ ine ’ s private credi@@ tors must now do their part , recognize the country ’ s economic and political situation , and accept a hair@@ cut on their bonds .
neither the ukra@@ ini@@ an economy – nor its political system – can afford that they do otherwise .
when inflation do@@ ves cry
pittsburgh – the wall street journal recently ran a front-@@ page article reporting that the mon@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ policy “ do@@ ves , ” who had forecast low inflation in the united states , have gotten the better of the “ haw@@ ks , ” who argued that the fed ’ s monthly purch@@ ases of long-term se@@ curi@@ ties , or so-called quantitative e@@ asing ( q@@ e ) , would unle@@ ash faster price growth .
the report was correct but mis@@ leading , for it failed to mention why there is so little inflation in the us today .
were the do@@ ves right , or just lucky ?
the us federal reserve board has pump@@ ed out trilli@@ ons of dollars of reserves , but never have so many reserves produced so little mon@@ etary growth .
neither the haw@@ ks nor the do@@ ves ( nor anyone else ) expected that .
mon@@ et@@ ari@@ sts insist that economies experience inflation when mon@@ e@@ y-@@ supply growth persi@@ stently exce@@ eds output growth .
that has not happened yet , so inflation has been post@@ po@@ ned .
instead of reje@@ cting mon@@ etary theory and history , the army of wall street so@@ oth@@ sa@@ yers should look beyond the fed ’ s press releases and ask themselves : does it make sense to throw out centuries of experience ?
are we really so confident that the fed has found a new way ?
the fed has printed new bank reserves with reck@@ less abandon .
but almost all of the reserves sit id@@ le on commercial banks ’ balance sheets .
for the 12 months ending in july , the st. louis fed reports that bank reserves rose 31 % .
during the same period , a commonly used measure of mon@@ etary growth , m@@ 2 , increased by only 6.@@ 8 % .
no sound mon@@ et@@ ar@@ ist thinks those numbers predict current inflation .
indeed , almost all the reserves added in the second and third ro@@ unds of q@@ e , more than 95 % , are sitting in excess reserves , neither l@@ ent nor bor@@ rowed and never used to increase money in circulation .
the fed pays the banks 0.@@ 25 % to keep them id@@ le .
with $ 2 trillion in excess reserves , and the prospect of as much as $ 85 billion added each month , banks receive $ 5 billion a year , and rising , without taking any risk .
for the bankers , that ’ s a bon@@ an@@ za , paid from mon@@ ies that the fed would normally pay to the us treas@@ ury .
and , adding insu@@ lt to injury , about half the payment goes to branches of foreign banks .
in normal times , there are valid reasons for paying interest on excess reserves .
currently , however , it is down@@ right counter-@@ productive .
bank loans have started to increase , but small bor@@ ro@@ wers , new bor@@ ro@@ wers , and start-@@ up companies are regularly refused .
current low interest rates do not cover the risk that banks would take .
to be sure , they could raise the rate for new and small bor@@ ro@@ wers ; but , in the current political climate , they would stand accused of sti@@ fl@@ ing economic recovery if they did .
the new consumer financial protection board is also a de@@ terr@@ ent , as banks consider it safer to l@@ end to the government , large corporations , and giant real-@@ estate spe@@ cul@@ ators .
the banks can report record profits without much risk , rebuild capital , and pay divi@@ den@@ ds and bon@@ uses .
and the fed can congratu@@ late itself on the mostly un@@ observed way that the large banks have used taxpa@@ yers ’ money .
instead of continuing along this fu@@ tile path , the fed should end its open-@@ ended q@@ e@@ 3 now .
it should stop paying interest on excess reserves until the us economy returns to a more normal foot@@ ing .
most important , it should announce a strategy for eliminating the massive volume of such reserves .
i am puzz@@ led , and frankly app@@ alled , by the fed ’ s failure to explain how it will restore its balance sheet to a non-@@ infla@@ tionary level .
the announ@@ c@@ ements to date simply increase uncertainty without telling the public anything useful .
selling $ 2 trillion of reserves will take years .
it must do more than repeat that the fed can raise interest rates paid on reserves to encourage banks to hold them .
it will take a clearly stated , widely understood strategy – the kind that paul vol@@ cker introduced in 197@@ 9@@ -@@ 1982 – to complete the job .
should the end of q@@ e come in september , december , or later ?
does it matter ?
historically , the fed has typically been slow to respond to inflation .
waiting until inflation is here , as some propose , is the usual way .
but that merely fuels inflation expectations and makes the task more painful .
and how high will the fed push up interest rates ?
once rates get to 5 % or 6 % , assuming inflation remains dor@@ m@@ ant , the fed can expect a bac@@ klas@@ h from congress , the administration , uni@@ ons , home@@ buil@@ ders , and others .
when contempl@@ ating the consequences of this , remember that 40 % of us government debt comes due within two years .
rolling it over at higher rates of 4 % or 5 % would add more than $ 100 billion to the budget deficit .
and that is just the first two years .
the budget cost increases every year , as more of the debt rolls over – and that does not include agency debt and the large increase in the curr@@ ent-@@ account deficit to pay china , japan , and other foreign holders of us debt .
those who believe that inflation will remain low should look more thorough@@ ly and think more clearly .
there are plenty of good textbooks that explain what too many policymakers and finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ market participants would rather forget .
send in the clo@@ w@@ ns
new york – when too many itali@@ ans voted late last month for either a lou@@ che and dis@@ credi@@ ted business ty@@ co@@ on or a comedian , european stock markets plum@@ me@@ ted .
with no public trust in the political class , italy might become un@@ govern@@ able .
but itali@@ ans are not alone .
rage against the political establishment has become a global phenomenon .
chinese bloggers , american tea party activists , british europ@@ ho@@ bes , egyptian islam@@ ists , dutch popu@@ lists , greek ultra-@@ righ@@ ti@@ sts , and thai “ red shirts ” all have one thing in common : hatred of the status quo and contemp@@ t for their countries ’ elites .
we are living in an age of popu@@ li@@ sm .
the authority of conventional politicians and traditional media is sli@@ pping away fast .
popu@@ li@@ sm can be a necessary correc@@ tive when political parties grow sc@@ ler@@ otic , mass media become too com@@ plac@@ ent ( or too close to power ) , and bureau@@ cra@@ cies are un@@ responsive to popular needs .
in a globalized world managed by bankers and techno@@ crats , many people feel that they have no say in public affairs ; they feel abandoned .
our national politicians , increasingly power@@ less to cope with serious crises , are suspected , often with good reason , of simply looking after their own interests .
all we can do is vote the ras@@ cals out , sometimes by voting for candidates whom we would not take seriously in more normal times .
italian elites are not the only ones in need of being sha@@ ken up .
but the problem with popu@@ li@@ sm is that it is rarely benign .
in the 19@@ 30 ’ s , it resulted in violent movements led by dangerous men in uniform .
today ’ s popu@@ lists are different .
they do not , on the whole , advocate violence .
some pre@@ ach that muslims are destroying western civilization .
others think that president barack obama is a kind of communist out to destroy america .
two types of contemporary popu@@ list , however , stand out : the ultra-@@ rich business ty@@ co@@ on and the clo@@ wn .
in the an@@ glo@@ -@@ sa@@ xon media world , ru@@ pert mur@@ doch , owner of far too many newspapers , tv stations , and movie studios , is a typical popu@@ list ty@@ co@@ on .
but he never aspi@@ red to lead a country .
former italian prime minister sil@@ vi@@ o ber@@ lus@@ con@@ i and former thai prime minister th@@ ak@@ sin sh@@ in@@ a@@ wat@@ ra did – and still do .
neither the clo@@ wn nor the ty@@ co@@ on is well su@@ ited to being a democratic leader .
the question is which is worse .
clo@@ w@@ ns have always played a role in politics .
medieval court je@@ sters were often the only ones who could speak truth to des@@ po@@ tic kings .
today , it is often comedi@@ ans who claim to speak truth to power – and to the public .
in america , liberals turn for political commentary to television comedi@@ ans like jon stewart and stephen col@@ bert , who are now more trusted than traditional news broad@@ ca@@ sters .
and clo@@ w@@ nish right-@@ wing radio tal@@ k-@@ show ho@@ sts now have more influence on many conservative american voters than the so@@ ber journalists of the mainstream media do .
a few years ago , a clo@@ wn named bro@@ z@@ o , with a large red nose and a bright green wig , was mexico ’ s most popular political comm@@ ent@@ ator on television , actively cour@@ ted by all candidates running for national office .
in 1980 , the french clo@@ wn col@@ u@@ che actually dropped out of the presidential race when one newspaper put his popular support at 16 % , causing him to fear that he might influence the result too much .
the prototype of modern european popu@@ li@@ sm was the flam@@ boy@@ ant dutch political show@@ man p@@ im for@@ tu@@ yn , who was ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ated in 2002 by a fana@@ tical veg@@ an .
for@@ tu@@ yn ’ s outrage@@ ousness was deliberately provo@@ cative and always entertaining .
his rants against the elites were often confused , but he was funny , which made the old elite politicians look like stu@@ ff@@ y old bor@@ es – which many of them were .
and now italy has be@@ ppe gri@@ llo , whose success in the country ’ s recent election makes him the first professional comedian to lead a major political party in europe .
the thing about clo@@ w@@ ns , though , is that few have any aspirations to rule their countries .
before his death , for@@ tu@@ yn is said to have been terrified of the prospect of becoming prime minister .
and gri@@ llo cannot even aspi@@ re to the job in italy because of his criminal record .
clo@@ w@@ ns mostly seek to provo@@ ke , and this can be healthy .
they are less likely than members of the professional political class to allow political calculations to influence their views .
and , sometimes , they actually say things that are uncomfortable but true , and that need to be said .
they attack the old elites not to shake things up , but to take their power .
promising to spread the ri@@ ches that they have made for themselves , they exploit the fantas@@ ies of those of us who have little and want more .
ber@@ lus@@ con@@ i understood the dreams of many itali@@ ans very well .
his extra@@ va@@ gan@@ ce , clo@@ w@@ nis@@ hness , and even his girls were part of his popular appeal .
like a bene@@ fi@@ cent king , he would give them money , and promised to challenge the old elites in bang@@ k@@ ok – the bankers , gener@@ als , judges , and even the cour@@ tiers surrounding the thai king .
but ty@@ co@@ ons are not natural democrats .
their main interest is in their own business .
and they do not hes@@ it@@ ate to under@@ mine an independent press or ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary when their business interests are threatened .
even though his sister , y@@ ing@@ luck sh@@ in@@ a@@ wat@@ ra , is now in power , th@@ ak@@ sin is still trying to ev@@ ade trial in thai courts on a wide array of financial charges .
as it happens , th@@ ak@@ sin was over@@ thrown in 2006 by a military coup that was largely backed by the bang@@ k@@ ok elites .
ber@@ lus@@ con@@ i was replaced by a government run by elite techno@@ crats , whose policies had to be approved by european bankers and european union bureau@@ crats .
neither of these responses to popu@@ li@@ sm is likely to boost democracy .
on the contrary , they make things worse .
what is needed is mainstream politicians who understand and respond to what is fu@@ eling popular rage .
paying attention to some of what the clo@@ w@@ ns are saying might be a good first step .
why don ’ t we trust our leaders ?
oxford – in developed democracies today , political leadership is increasingly up for grabs .
voters , clearly tired of the status quo , want change at the top , leaving even major parties ’ establi@@ sh@@ ments struggling to install leaders of their choosing .
in the united kingdom , lab@@ our party mps have been sty@@ mi@@ ed in their efforts to un@@ seat jere@@ my cor@@ by@@ n as leader .
in japan , the rul@@ ing liberal democratic party ’ s preferred candidate for governor of tokyo , hiro@@ ya ma@@ su@@ da , lost in a land@@ slide to yu@@ ri@@ ko ko@@ i@@ ke .
as for the united states , the republican party wanted virtually anybody except don@@ ald trum@@ p to win the nom@@ ination for the pres@@ iden@@ cy ; yet trum@@ p it is .
and while the democratic party is being represented by the establishment choice , hillary clinton , her competi@@ tor , ber@@ nie s@@ anders , put up a much stronger fight than virtually anyone anticipated .
the message to the establishment is clear : we don ’ t trust you anymore .
but some of the leaders voters do trust could pose a very real danger – to their suppor@@ ters , their countries , and the world .
trum@@ p – with his admi@@ ration of dictators , unab@@ ashed racism and sex@@ ism , ignorance regar@@ ding the issues , and mer@@ curi@@ al temper@@ ament – stands at the top of this list .
those who led the british campaign to leave the european union – such as conservatives like bor@@ is johnson ( now the country ’ s foreign secretary ) and ni@@ gel far@@ age , the right-@@ wing popu@@ list leader of the uk independence party – are similarly dis@@ para@@ ged for reck@@ lessly je@@ opar@@ di@@ zing the future of the uk and the eu alike .
if mainstream leaders want to change voters ’ minds , they should look carefully at what leadership really means .
here , it is worth rec@@ alling the insights of us general george c. marshall , who contempl@@ ated the topic as he worked to rebuild the us military in the 194@@ 0s .
marshall argued that leadership is a matter not of rhetoric , but of character .
in particular , leaders must display three key qualities to win the trust needed to lead effectively : purpose , im@@ parti@@ ality , and compe@@ tence .
purpose , in his view , meant putting the greater good ahead of one ’ s own interests .
a shining example is jo cox , the young british mp who was murdered during the bre@@ x@@ it campaign , whose leadership in advoc@@ ating for the rights of refugees was recognized across party lines .
but , in many cases , politics has become a matter of self-@@ promotion – and a race for ratings .
in today ’ s celebrity culture , politicians must be “ personalities . ” they campaign like con@@ te@@ stan@@ ts on a reality tv show .
trum@@ p , with his clo@@ w@@ nish looks and show@@ bi@@ z res@@ u@@ me , is probably the ultimate example of this shift .
( the hu@@ ff@@ ington post even decided last summer to publish coverage of trum@@ p ’ s campaign in its entertainment section . )
the problem is not only that this can lead to the election of utterly un@@ qualified leaders .
it is also that , once elected , even qualified leaders can struggle to shed the personal elements of their decision-making , and serve the country im@@ partially instead .
the sli@@ pper@@ y slope is exposed in a mem@@ o – recently dis@@ closed as part of the uk ’ s chil@@ co@@ t inquiry – written by former british prime minister tony blair to former us president george w. bush in the run@@ -up to the iraq war .
the note begins , “ i will be with you , whatever . ” he was talking about leading his country into war .
yet his language suggests that his personal bond with bush somehow took prece@@ dence over his duty as prime minister .
leading with purpose , rather than personality , is closely related to the im@@ parti@@ ality that marshall thought essential .
once in office , leaders must act with fairness and cand@@ or .
they must resist the temptation to use official power to benefit themselves , their families , or their cultural identity group , and refuse entic@@ ements , however powerful they may be , to offer special access or protection to friends , funders , and lobby@@ ists .
maintaining a high standard of im@@ parti@@ ality is not easy , but it is far from impossible .
president pe@@ dr@@ o p@@ ires of cape ver@@ de was awar@@ ded the 2011 i@@ bra@@ him prize for achievement in african leadership , for transforming his country into “ a model of democracy , stability , and increased prosperity . ”
p@@ ires retired from office without even a house to his name ; he worked for the people , not to ama@@ ss personal wealth .
the third cri@@ teri@@ on for good leadership – compe@@ tence – is not just a matter of how much knowledge a leader already poss@@ esses .
as marshall not@@ ed , it also consists in leaders ’ capacity to learn from their mistakes and to prepare themselves and those around them for important decisions .
chil@@ co@@ t ’ s verdi@@ ct on britain ’ s lack of preparation for the iraq war and its after@@ math is dam@@ ning in this regard .
so is the bre@@ x@@ it@@ e@@ ers ’ lack of any plan whatsoever for how to proceed after the refer@@ end@@ um .
voters need to see candidates who show purpose , im@@ parti@@ ality , and compe@@ tence .
if they don ’ t , they will continue to vote against the establishment that they believe has failed them – even if it means voting for tur@@ mo@@ il in europe or a reck@@ less nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ist in the us .
why vote ?
as an australian citizen , i voted in the recent federal election there .
so did about 95 % of registered australian voters .
that figure contra@@ sts marke@@ dly with elections in the united states , where the turn@@ out in the 2004 presidential election barely exce@@ eded 60 % .
in con@@ gressi@@ onal elections that fall in the middle of a president ’ s term , usually fewer than 40 % of eli@@ gible americans bother to vote .
there is a reason why so many australi@@ ans vote .
in the 19@@ 20 ’ s , when vot@@ er turn@@ out fell below 60 % , parliament made voting compul@@ sor@@ y .
since then , despite governments of var@@ ying political complexi@@ ons , there has been no serious attempt to repe@@ al the law , which polls show is supported by about 70 % of the population .
those without an acceptable excuse , like illness or travel abroad , must pay a small fine , but the number fined is less than 1 % of eli@@ gible voters .
in practice , what is compul@@ sor@@ y is not casting a valid vote , but going to the poll@@ ing place , having one ’ s name checked off , and putting a bal@@ lot paper in the box .
the secre@@ cy of the bal@@ lot makes it impossible to prevent people writing nonsense on their bal@@ lot papers or leaving them blank .
while the percentage of inv@@ al@@ id votes is a little higher where voting is compul@@ sor@@ y , it comes nowhere near off@@ setting the difference in vot@@ er turn@@ out .
compul@@ sor@@ y voting is not unique to australia .
bel@@ gi@@ um and argentina introduced it earlier , and it is practiced in many other countries , especially in latin america , although both san@@ ctions and en@@ for@@ cement vary .
because i was in the us at the time of the australian election , i was under no compul@@ sion to vote .
i had many reasons to hope for the defeat of john howard ’ s conservative government , but that doesn ’ t explain why i went to some trouble to vote , since the likelihood that my vote would make any difference was min@@ is@@ cule ( and , predic@@ tably , it did not ) .
when voting is voluntary , and the chance that the result will be determined by any single person ’ s vote is extremely low , even the smallest cost – for example , the time it takes to stro@@ ll down to the poll@@ ing place , wait in line , and cast a bal@@ lot – is sufficient to make voting seem irrational .
yet if many people follow this line of reasoning , and do not vote , a minority of the population can determine a country ’ s future , leaving a dis@@ cont@@ ented majority .
poland ’ s recent elec@@ toral history provides an example .
in the 2005 national elections , barely 40 % of those eli@@ gible voted , the lowest total since the ad@@ vent of free elections after the communist period .
as a result , j@@ aro@@ s@@ law kac@@ zy@@ n@@ ski was able to become prime minister with the support of a coalition of parties that gained a majority of seats in parliament , despite receiving only six million votes , out of a total of 30 million eli@@ gible voters .
when kac@@ zy@@ n@@ ski was forced to go to the polls again only two years later , it became evident that many of those who had not voted in 2005 were unhappy with the outcome .
kac@@ zy@@ n@@ ski ’ s government suffered a heavy defeat .
if we don ’ t want a small minority to determine our government , we will favor a high turn@@ out .
yet since our own vote makes such a tiny contribution to the outcome , each of us still faces the temptation to get a free ride , not bo@@ ther@@ ing to vote while hoping that enough other people will vote to keep democracy robust and to ele@@ ct a government that is responsive to the views of a majority of citizens .
but there are many possible reasons for voting .
some people vote because they enjoy it , and would have nothing better to do with the time saved if they did not .
others are motivated by a sense of civic duty that does not ass@@ ess the ration@@ ality of voting in terms of the possible impact of one ’ s own bal@@ lot .
still others might vote not because they imagine that they will determine the outcome of the election , but because , like football fans , they want to che@@ er their team on .
they may vote because if they don ’ t , they will be in no position to complain if they don ’ t like the government that is elected .
or they may calculate that while the chances of their determin@@ ing the outcome are only one in several million , the result is of such importance that even that tiny chance is enough to out@@ weigh the minor in@@ conveni@@ ences of voting .
if these consider@@ ations fail to get people to the polls , however , compul@@ sor@@ y voting is one way of over@@ coming the free-@@ rider problem .
the small cost imposed on not voting makes it rational for everyone to vote and at the same time establi@@ shes a social norm of voting .
australi@@ ans want to be co@@ er@@ ced into voting .
they are happy to vote , knowing that everyone else is voting , too .
countries worried about low vot@@ er turn@@ out would do well to consider their compul@@ sor@@ y model .
why wait for the euro ?
although the eu &apos;s e@@ ast@@ ward en@@ lar@@ gement has not yet happened , the debate is already shifting to ask what will follow : when should the new , pre@@ domin@@ antly post@@ communist , members adopt the euro ?
assuming that they comp@@ ly with the ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht treaty &apos;s pro@@ visions concern@@ ing the em@@ u - and are not un@@ fairly held to more string@@ ent criteria - the core issue is whether new members would benefit more by waiting or whether they should seek early entry .
at the out@@ set , it must be stressed that , in seeking earlier entry into the em@@ u a country assumes a more ambitious fiscal and structural program than would be needed if em@@ u mem@@ ber@@ ship is del@@ a@@ yed .
early entry , otherwise , would be an empty gesture .
i believe that early adoption of the euro is not only possible , but prefer@@ able to delay .
by early adoption i mean the shor@@ test per@@ mis@@ sible period of time - two years - following a new member sub@@ ordin@@ ating its mon@@ etary policy to the fiscal and mon@@ etary constraints of the exchange rate mechanism ( er@@ m ii ) .
assuming entry into both the eu and er@@ m ii in 2004 , new members should aim to enter the euro@@ zone around 2006 .
is this realistic ?
well , most candidate countries have already achieved a high degree of structural convergence with the eu .
exports to the union have so@@ ared since 1991 , when the collapse of the so@@ viet@@ -@@ era com@@ ec@@ on trading system forced a radical re@@ orientation of trade - helped by massive foreign investment from the eu - towards western markets .
most acc@@ ession candidates now send more exports to the eu than greece , portugal , and spain did when they entered the eu and em@@ u .
progress on dis@@ inflation is similarly impressive .
annual inflation in most candidate countries has fallen to 4-@@ 5 % - not much higher than in many eu countries , and lower than in the netherlands last year .
as with structural convergence , eu candidates already out@@ perform spain , portugal , and greece at a comparable time before their em@@ u de@@ but .
nor is there much risk of large , future correc@@ tive price s@@ wings because all but a few prices are completely liber@@ alized .
theoretical studies suggest that inflation in the acc@@ ession countries will remain stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly higher than the ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht treaty allows .
the cul@@ pr@@ it in this pessimi@@ stic view is the so-called &quot; bal@@ as@@ sa@@ -@@ samu@@ el@@ son &quot; effect : rapid productivity growth in the acc@@ ession candidates &apos; tra@@ dable sectors - export manufacturing , for example - is pushing up real wages throughout their economies , including in non-@@ tra@@ dable sectors like services .
this overall rise in real wages in the face of lower productivity growth for the service sector boo@@ sts relative prices and keeps inflation above the euro@@ zone average .
the bal@@ as@@ sa@@ -@@ samu@@ el@@ son effect is still evident in greece , spain and portugal .
but as empiri@@ cal research prepared by the ce@@ c@@ 5 national banks estimates , its contribution to total price growth in the candidate countries is 1-@@ 2 % .
with the bal@@ as@@ sa@@ -@@ samu@@ el@@ son effect so sub@@ du@@ ed and limited scope for future correc@@ tive inflation , the em@@ u cri@@ teri@@ on regar@@ ding price stability - of annual inflation within 1.5 % of the average rate for the three best-@@ performing economies in the eu - is within reach .
but is early ad@@ mission to em@@ u prefer@@ able to post@@ po@@ ning mem@@ ber@@ ship ?
from the standpoint of current member states , would admit@@ ting hung@@ ary , lat@@ via , poland , or slo@@ v@@ ak@@ ia , sooner rather than later , drag down the euro as many fear ?
fears that extending em@@ u to new states &quot; too soon &quot; would under@@ mine the euro &apos;s external exchange rate are irrational .
if all candidate countries join the eu at around the same time , they will together account for a mere 6 % of its total gdp .
so any negative impact on the euro from rapid acc@@ ession to em@@ u would at worst amount to little more than a ro@@ unding error .
del@@ a@@ ying entry into em@@ u could make sense if a longer wait produced more information .
but a wait of greater length might produce nothing but added noise .
equally , the transition period is already turbul@@ ent , with conver@@ gen@@ ce-@@ driven capital flows driving up exchange rates and complic@@ ating mon@@ etary policy in several candidate countries , including poland , the c@@ ze@@ ch republic , and hung@@ ary .
indeed , capit@@ al-@@ flow vola@@ tili@@ ty could make short work of the flexible exchange rate on offer under er@@ m ii - a 15 % fluctu@@ ation band either side of a central par@@ ity .
some argue that er@@ m ii mem@@ ber@@ ship should be viewed as a lon@@ ger-@@ term proposition - possibly lasting until 2010 - for the benefit of candidates themselves .
the benefit is simple : er@@ m ii per@@ mit@@ s some exchange rate flexibility , as opposed to the fixed rates impli@@ ed by adopting the euro .
this would help keep the candidates &apos; economic output high and thus sustain real convergence with average eu income levels .
this is an excep@@ tionally weak argument , and a politically suspect one , too .
as european central bank data shows , average per capita gdp in the acc@@ ession candidates is 44 % of the euro@@ zone level .
the size of the income gap combin@@ es with the small growth differenti@@ als to imp@@ ly that the process of real convergence will extend far beyond even the most cau@@ tious dates for eu and em@@ u entry , probably lasting several decades .
more important , long-@@ lasting economic growth does not depend on the type of exchange rate - whether flexible or fixed ( em@@ u ) - while early acc@@ ession will speed up crucial reforms .
a few years of limited exchange rate flexibility is a poor substitute for rapid comple@@ tion of structural reforms .
in almost all candidates , further dis@@ inflation and long-term economic growth require fiscal con@@ soli@@ dation , more flexible labor markets , and comple@@ tion of priva@@ tization .
del@@ a@@ ying em@@ u entry risks weak@@ ening the incentive to complete these politically costly but necessary reforms .
any delay in comple@@ ting reforms will ultimately slow the process of real convergence that eu officials rightly hold dear .
early adoption , by contrast , would be more condu@@ ci@@ ve to these reforms , and thus to real convergence .
success here would allow candidate countries to start re@@ ap@@ ing the benefits of greater price transparency , reduced trans@@ action costs , and a solid macro@@ economic framework .
this strategy , not one of de@@ fer@@ red entry , promises the most for both the eu &apos;s current and its future members .
the battle for water
new york – the shar@@ pen@@ ing international geo@@ political competition over natural resources has turned some strategic resources into engines of power struggle .
transnational water resources have become an especially active source of competition and conflict , trig@@ gering a dam@@ -@@ building race and promp@@ ting growing calls for the united nations to recognize water as a key security concern .
water is different from other natural resources .
after all , there are substit@@ utes for many resources , including oil , but none for water .
similarly , countries can import fossil fuels , mineral ores , and resources from the biosphere like fish and timber ; but they cannot import water , which is essentially local , on a large scale and on a pro@@ lon@@ ged – much less permanent – basis .
water is hea@@ vier than oil , making it very expensive to ship or transport across long distances even by pipeline ( which would require large , energy-@@ intensive pumps ) .
the paradox of water is that it susta@@ ins life but can also cause death when it becomes a car@@ rier of deadly microbes or takes the form of a tsunami , flash flood , storm , or hurricane .
many of the greatest natural disasters of our time – including , for example , the fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma catastrophe in 2011 – have been wat@@ er-@@ related .
global warming is set to put po@@ tab@@ le-@@ water supplies under increasing strain – even as oceans rise and the intensity and frequency of storms and other extreme weather events increase .
rapid economic and demographic expansion has already turned adequate access to po@@ table water into a major issue across large parts of the world .
lifestyle changes , for example , have spur@@ red increasing per capita water consumption , with rising incomes promoting di@@ etary change , for example , especially higher consumption of meat , production of which is ten times more wat@@ er-@@ intensive , on average , than plan@@ t-@@ based calories and proteins .
today , the earth ’ s human population tot@@ als slightly more than seven billion , but the livestock population at any given time numbers more than 150 billion .
the direct ecological footprint of the livestock population is larger than that of the human population , with rapidly rising global meat consumption becoming a key driver of water stress by itself .
political and economic water wars are already being wa@@ ged in several regions , reflected in dam construction on international rivers and co@@ er@@ ci@@ ve diplomacy or other means to prevent such works .
consider , for example , the silent water war triggered by ethiopia ’ s dam building on the blue ni@@ le , which has e@@ lic@@ ited egyptian threats of cover@@ t or over@@ t military re@@ pris@@ als .
a report reflecting the joint judgment of us intelligence agencies war@@ ned last year that the use of water as a weapon of war or a tool of terrorism would become more likely in the next decade in some regions .
the interaction council , com@@ prising more than 30 former heads of state or government , has called for urgent action to prevent some countries bat@@ tling severe water shor@@ tages from becoming failed states .
the us state department , for its part , has up@@ gra@@ ded water to “ a central us foreign policy concern . ”
in many countries , inadequate local water availability is increasingly constra@@ ining decisions about where to set up new manufacturing facilities and energy plants .
the world bank estimates that such constraints are co@@ sting china 2.@@ 3 % of gdp .
china , however , is not yet in the category of wat@@ er-@@ stressed states .
those that are , stre@@ tching from south korea and india to egypt and israel , are paying an even higher price for their water problems .
these countries already understand that water is a renewable but finite resource .
nature ’ s wat@@ er-@@ re@@ plen@@ ishment capacity is fixed , limit@@ ing the world ’ s usable fresh@@ water resources to about 200,000 cubic kilometers .
but the human population has almost doubled since 1970 , while the global economy has grown even faster .
major increases in water demand , however , are being driven not merely by economic and demographic growth , or by the additional energy , manufacturing , and food production to meet rising consumption levels , but also by the fact that the global population is getting fat@@ ter .
the average body mass index ( bmi ) of humans has been increasing in the post-@@ world war ii period , but especially since the 1980 ’ s , with the prevalence of obesity doubling in the past three decades .
hea@@ vier citizens make hea@@ vier demands on natural resources , especially water and energy .
the issue thus is not just about how many mouths there are to feed , but also how much excess body fat there is on the planet .
for example , a study published in the british journal b@@ m@@ c public health has found that if the rest of the world had the same average body mass index as the us , this would be the equivalent of adding almost one billion people to the global population , greatly exac@@ erb@@ ating water stress .
with the era of cheap , boun@@ ti@@ ful water having been replaced by increasing supply and quality constraints , many investors are beginning to view water as the new oil .
the dramatic rise of the bot@@ tle@@ d-@@ water industry since the 1990 ’ s at@@ tests to the increasing commodi@@ fication of the world ’ s most critical resource .
not only are water shor@@ tages likely to intensi@@ fy and spread , but consumers also will increasingly have to pay more for their water supply .
this double wh@@ am@@ my can be mi@@ tig@@ ated only by innovative water management and conservation , and by developing non@@ traditional supply sources .
as in the oil and gas sector – where ta@@ pping un@@ conventional sources , such as shal@@ e and tar sands , has proved a game chan@@ ger – the water sector must adopt all un@@ conventional options , including recycling waste@@ water and desal@@ in@@ ating ocean and bra@@ ck@@ ish waters .
in short , we must focus on addressing our wat@@ er-@@ supply problems as if our lives depended on it .
in fact , they do .
the biology of luxury
paris – despite the global economic crisis , sales of luxury goods are sur@@ ging worldwide .
why ?
while marketing has contributed to the rise , the luxury market ’ s robust growth is actually rooted in biology .
discussions about the structure of human thought have long been dominated by the enlightenment view that reality is composed of four elements : space , time , matter , and energy .
but recently , a fifth element , information , has entered the debate .
and information , it turns out , is crucial to understanding the fundamental drivers of lux@@ ur@@ y-@@ goods consumption , and thus to predicting the luxury market ’ s future .
living organisms communicate , and the information that they exchange shapes their reality .
while animals use colorful displays and complicated behaviors to signal fitness and strength , humans use luxury goods to demonstrate economic health .
but , more than a symbol , buying luxury goods could indicate future success , o@@ wing to the selective advantage that showing off provides .
in nature , competitors perform , and the most compelling , beautiful spectac@@ le wins .
for most animals , males are the performers .
male birds , for example , often have bri@@ ghtly colored plu@@ mage or intricate app@@ en@@ da@@ ges , such as the australian ly@@ re@@ bird ’ s long tail .
as a result , competitive displays have been interpreted as a way to demonstrate fitness to a potential mate .
a bird that survi@@ ves , despite inconvenient plu@@ mage that slo@@ ws it down or makes it visible to predators , must be fit , and will likely si@@ re a healthy pro@@ geny .
given that females bear the physical burden of offspring , an un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive appearance is more advanta@@ geous – and thus more common – in nature .
but humans are social creatures with no natural predators , so female competition is more widespread – and demon@@ stra@@ tive performance and display are more likely .
indeed , while visual manife@@ stations of wealth are prevalent for both gen@@ ders , women ’ s appearance is frequently more vivid ( and more closely scru@@ tin@@ ized ) .
but effective display is costly .
developing complex , vibrant plu@@ mage demands significant energy and genetic resources .
genes are difficult to maintain , requ@@ ir@@ ing subtle and energy-@@ intensive correc@@ ting processes .
just as writing too fast can cause typo@@ graphi@@ cal errors that gar@@ ble a text , rapid changes to the genome can under@@ mine a species ’ integrity .
likewise , purchasing luxury goods requires substantial financial resources .
this cost dictat@@ es the display ’ s competitive impact .
in today ’ s information@@ -based world , selection is effective only if a striking appearance is obtained at a very high price – and that price is known .
this is not the result of efficiency ( the most effective cos@@ me@@ tics frequently become pharmaceutical drugs ) .
rather , it signals a lifestyle that values the preservation of beauty and youth .
cos@@ me@@ tics , like all luxury products , gain influence not from their production , or even their purchase , but from their visi@@ bility .
indeed , an expensive item with no label or identi@@ fying characteristics has less competitive impact than a recognized item or brand .
for luxury goods to have any function , society needs information about their cost .
this has been true to var@@ ying degrees throughout history – sometimes resul@@ ting in price bubbles .
false information , such as counter@@ f@@ eit goods , je@@ opar@@ di@@ zes the competi@@ tion-@@ based selection process .
animals commonly use mimi@@ cry to capit@@ alize on knowledge – or fear – of another ’ s strength .
by imit@@ ating an animal with a well-known protective profile , a weaker one may enjoy selective benefits without the costs .
but mimi@@ cry ’ s success in nature depends on the ratio of the original to the ersatz .
if there are too few of the original , the profile loses its significance , and its protective value van@@ ishes .
similarly , nobody would display a symbol of wealth if it were too common .
therefore , ass@@ essing whether luxury goods will maintain their impact , and thus their appeal , requires monitoring the extent of counter@@ fei@@ ting .
given that luxury goods provide individuals with a competitive advantage , higher lux@@ ur@@ y-@@ goods sales could indicate a bri@@ ghter economic future for a country .
in a time of crisis , countries in which luxury goods play their selective role effectively are the sa@@ fest be@@ ts for productive investment .
why we need “ game of thr@@ ones ”
paris – today ’ s popular television programs have become the equivalent of the feu@@ il@@ let@@ ons that began appearing in newspapers in the n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth century .
series like “ game of thr@@ ones ” and “ down@@ ton ab@@ be@@ y , ” like bal@@ zac and dick@@ ens before them , serve as a source of entertainment and fo@@ dder for debate .
in this sense , our television screen@@ plays have emerged as key tools of social and political analysis .
such tools can be used to compre@@ hend , for example , the difference between israeli prime minister bin@@ yam@@ in net@@ any@@ ah@@ u and us president barack obama .
net@@ any@@ ah@@ u is still stuck in the third season of “ homeland ” – that is , obsessed with iran – whereas obama , having begun to include the rene@@ wed russian threat in his strategic calculus , has already moved into the third season of “ house of cards . ”
of course , the availability of such compar@@ is@@ ons is rooted in what often drives a tv series ’ popul@@ arity : its ability to hold up a mirror to a society – to reflect its anx@@ ie@@ ties and long@@ ings – and create a window through which outsi@@ ders can peer in .
consider “ down@@ ton ab@@ be@@ y , ” a british period drama that follows the lives of the craw@@ ley family and its ser@@ van@@ ts in the family ’ s classic country house , from 19@@ 12 to the mid-@@ 19@@ 20s .
why are millions of people worldwide – from europe to the united states to asia – so attracted to these characters ?
are they nostal@@ gic for a time long past , which the show re@@ constit@@ utes with exac@@ ting ver@@ isi@@ mili@@ tude ?
or are they fascinated by the social dynamics that the show explores ?
for julian fel@@ low@@ es , who created the series , the explanation lies elsewhere – in our search for order in a chaotic world .
people feel so dis@@ oriented nowadays , he believes , that they are drawn to “ down@@ ton ab@@ be@@ y ’ s ” ti@@ dy realm , in which the setting , clearly del@@ ine@@ ated in space and time , is governed by strict rules .
just as the craw@@ ley house serves as a kind of refu@@ ge for its characters , it may give its viewers a safe , predictable out@@ let by which to escape the tu@@ mul@@ tu@@ ous present – and avoid the unknown future .
similarly , the american political drama “ house of cards ” reflects a kind of dis@@ illusion@@ ment – this time , with us politics .
whereas “ the west wing , ” a popular political drama that ran from 1999 to 2006 , portra@@ ys the us pres@@ iden@@ cy – held by a sophisticated , cultiv@@ ated , and humani@@ stic leader – with a kind of longing , “ house of cards ” immer@@ ses the viewer in a mur@@ ky mi@@ lie@@ u of humanity ’ s worst impulses .
in “ house of cards , ” the world is not as viewers believe it should be , but as they fear it is .
this is the opposite of the approach taken by the danish political drama “ bor@@ gen , ” which presents an ide@@ alized prime minister , bir@@ git@@ te ny@@ bor@@ g .
but the effect is similar .
one often hears people saying that the true problem facing denmark – and , in particular , its political class – is that prime minister helle thor@@ n@@ ing-@@ sch@@ mid@@ t lac@@ ks ny@@ bor@@ g ’ s strengths .
by exposing the fundamental challenges and anx@@ ie@@ ties facing a society , a tv series can , at times , almost pre@@ figure the future .
in retro@@ spect , the series seems to have fores@@ ha@@ do@@ wed the tragedies that bes@@ et the country in january .
in particular , the fifth season , which ai@@ red in france in late 20@@ 14 , offered a clinical description of how young people in the paris suburbs went a@@ stra@@ y , while portra@@ ying the relationship between the police and their political super@@ i@@ ors as cy@@ ni@@ cal and even com@@ ba@@ tive .
the show ’ s dialogue could have come straight out of a real-@@ life par@@ isi@@ an “ power lunch . ”
the tv show that has emerged as the most hot@@ ly deb@@ ated of our time is , without a doubt , “ game of thr@@ ones , ” a medieval fantasy epic based ( increasingly loo@@ sely ) on george r.@@ r. martin ’ s best-@@ selling book series a song of ice and fire .
the series has become known not just for its massive budget or intricate storytelling , but also for its sustained chore@@ ography of brutal violence .
students of international politics , especially in canada and the us , wonder whether the show , by stres@@ sing the role of sheer bru@@ tality , encoura@@ ges a “ re@@ alist ” vision of the world .
could the sava@@ gery fe@@ atu@@ red on “ games of thr@@ ones ” – including abundant be@@ head@@ ings , rape , and sexual torture – have helped to encourage the tactics of , say , bo@@ ko har@@ am and the islamic state ?
or could the series – in which violence often be@@ gets more violence , but does not necessarily get the characters what they want – actually be high@@ lighting the limits of force ?
on a more philosophical level , the show ’ s universe – a combination of ancient mythology and the middle ages – seems to capture the mixture of fascination and fear that many people nowadays feel .
it is a fantastic , unpredictable , and deva@@ stat@@ ingly painful world – one that is so complex that even the show ’ s most lo@@ yal viewers often are confused .
in this sense , it is much like the world in which we live .
though the west has no monopoly on the production of tv series , it und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly domin@@ ates the field – and thus the worldview that such shows reflect .
given this , one might wonder whether chinese or russian leaders are making time in their busy schedul@@ es to watch series such as “ house of cards ” or “ games of thr@@ ones , ” in order to understand their ri@@ vals ’ mentality .
leading government advis@@ ers , at least , seem to recognize the value of tun@@ ing in .
a chinese friend recently told me that “ house of cards ” was very popular among china ’ s political elite .
they reli@@ sh the reminder that politics is just as ru@@ th@@ less in the us as it is at home .
though much remains to be accomplished and con@@ soli@@ dated , his achievements as leader of the international development community are note@@ worthy and provide a strong foundation upon which to build .
perhaps wol@@ fen@@ sohn ’ s most important contribution was to clari@@ fy the bank ’ s mission – to promote growth and eradicate poverty in the developing world – while recognizing the massive scale of that task and the in@@ adequ@@ acy of previous approaches .
at one time , it was thought that since developing countries had less capital than more developed countries , merely sup@@ plying more capital would solve their problems .
indeed , this view provided part of the rationale for the world bank : if a shortage of funds was the problem , clearly a bank would have to be a key part of the solution .
in the 1980 ’ s , there was a switch from projects to policies – structural adju@@ st@@ ments , involving trade liber@@ alization , priva@@ tization , and macro@@ economic stabili@@ zation ( typically focusing on prices rather than employment or output . )
but these policies proved neither necessary nor sufficient for growth ; the countries of east asia , which followed different policies , achieved faster growth and were far more successful in poverty reduction .
under wol@@ fen@@ sohn ’ s leadership , the bank began to look for multi@@ fac@@ eted strategies , fra@@ med by what he called a comprehensive development framework .
many of the links were obvious , but had been given in@@ sufficient attention .
improved rural productivity or better market access would do little good if roads and harb@@ ors were lac@@ king .
in a malari@@ a-@@ in@@ fest@@ ed country , mosquito eradication programs can boost production and even increase effective land usage , as acres that were almost un@@ inhabit@@ able become li@@ vable .
the returns from education , too , can be increased , if more individuals live longer because of better health care .
the bank began to recognize that developing countries differ@@ ed from more developed countries not just in their lack of resources ; there was also a knowledge gap .
this was particularly important as the world moved into what we call the “ knowledge economy . ”
among the success stories were india and east asia , which invested heavily not just in primary education , but also in secondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary education , and especially in technology and science .
this represented a major change in the bank ’ s approach to education , which previously focused on primary schooling .
wol@@ fen@@ sohn ’ s campaign against corruption also represented a major change in thinking , a shift from down@@ si@@ zing the state to improving the state .
failed states , it was now acknowled@@ ged , were no less an im@@ pedi@@ ment to development than were over@@ bearing states .
the bank ’ s 1997 world development report reflected this new attempt at finding a balanced role for the state , and showed an understanding of the limitations both of markets and government .
under wol@@ fen@@ sohn , the bank repeatedly stood up to the united states , where both the clinton and bush admini@@ strations might have preferred a more pli@@ ant president .
when then us de@@ pu@@ ty secretary of the treas@@ ury lawrence su@@ mmers tried to change the bank ’ s dec@@ en@@ ni@@ al report on poverty – to down@@ grade concerns about inse@@ curity and empowerment and to focus more nar@@ row@@ ly on income – the bank prevail@@ ed .
when the us tried to suppress the bank ’ s call for a more balanced intellectual property regime – one more con@@ son@@ ant with the interests of developing countries – the bank prevail@@ ed yet again .
both the bush administration and the eu would und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly have preferred less criticism of their trade regimes , which have such ad@@ verse effects on developing countries .
it would have been helpful for bush if the world bank quietly accepted pro@@ pos@@ als to finance debt relief for the poorest countries by deple@@ ting its reserves , thereby making poor countries pay for the poorest by reducing the bank ’ s len@@ ding capacity .
but it would have been wrong , and the bank again stood up for the interests of the developing world .
changing the relationship between the bank and the countries seeking its help was no less of an achievement .
in the past , the bank was seen as a pur@@ ve@@ yor of neo@@ liberal orthodo@@ xy – an approach to development whose credi@@ bility had weak@@ ened by the time wol@@ fen@@ sohn arrived , and whose standing has ero@@ ded further since .
that orthodo@@ xy often went hand in hand with the national , corporate , and financial interests of the advanced industrial countries , or so it was perceived .
worse , the bank typically demand@@ ed myri@@ ad conditions in return for assistance , an approach that under@@ min@@ ed democratic processes and domestic ownership of policies , thereby ener@@ v@@ ating their effectiveness .
when bank research showed that condi@@ tionality did not work , the bank under wol@@ fen@@ sohn moved away from it .
the bank began to realize that on many key issues there were legitimate dis@@ agre@@ ements among economists about the right course of action .
democracy requires active debate about economic policies , not the supp@@ ression of discussion or the dele@@ gation of decision-making to experts , whether domestic or foreign .
the bank ’ s attempt to open the debate was not well received , by either the us treas@@ ury or the imf , but its influence was un@@ deni@@ able .
the fund , too , began to reduce condi@@ tionality , and eventually it began to question the des@@ ir@@ ability of capital market liber@@ alization , which previously had been central to its agenda .
gradually the bank came to be perceived , at least in many quarters , as a partner in the joint quest for growth and poverty reduction , not an ad@@ versary attemp@@ ting to promote a western economic agenda or ideology .
wol@@ fen@@ sohn meant it when he said that he wanted to put the country in the driver ’ s seat , though not everyone within the bank was as enthusiastic about this ( or some of his other ) initi@@ atives .
james wol@@ fen@@ sohn presi@@ ded over the world bank at a time of enormous change , tu@@ mul@@ t , and opportunity , an era marked by the end of the cold war , the post@@ communist transition to market economies , and the east asian – and then global – financial crises .
his commitment to those in the developing world has been contagious .
he has left an impressive legacy for his success@@ or to take up .
why women still can ’ t ask the right questions
new york – we are just reco@@ vering , in the united states , from the entirely predictable ker@@ fu@@ ff@@ le over a pla@@ int published by an@@ ne@@ -@@ marie s@@ laughter , former director of policy planning at the state department and a professor at princeton university , called “ why women still can ’ t have it all . ”
the response was predictable because s@@ laughter ’ s article is one that is published in the us by a revol@@ ving cast of powerful ( most often white ) women every three years or so .
the article , whoever has written it , always be@@ mo@@ ans the “ myth ” of a wor@@ k-@@ life balance for women who work outside the home , presents the glass ceiling and wor@@ k-@@ family exhau@@ stion as a personal revelation , and bl@@ ames “ femin@@ ism ” for holding out this elu@@ sive “ ha@@ v@@ ing-@@ it-@@ all ideal . ”
and it always manages to ev@@ ade the major policy elephants in the room – which is especially ironic in this case , as s@@ laughter was wor@@ n out by cra@@ fting policy .
the problems with such arguments are many .
for star@@ ters , the wor@@ k-@@ family balance is no longer a women ’ s issue .
all over the developed world , millions of working men with small children also regret the hours that they spend away from them , and go home to bear the br@@ unt of shared domestic tasks .
this was a “ women ’ s issue ” 15 years ago , perhaps , but now it is an ambi@@ ent tension of modern life for a generation of women and men who are committed to gender equality .
such arguments also ignore the fact that afflu@@ ent working women and their partners overwhel@@ m@@ ingly off@@ load the wor@@ k-@@ family imbalance onto lower@@ -@@ income women – overwhel@@ m@@ ingly women of color .
one can address how to be an ethical , sustainable emplo@@ yer of such caregi@@ vers ; nan@@ ni@@ es in new york and other cities are now organizing to secure a system of market@@ -@@ pe@@ gged wages , vacation time , and sick days .
or , as so often happens in a ra@@ cist society , one can paint the women who care for the elite ’ s children out of the picture altogether .
moreover , an in@@ flexible and famil@@ y-@@ un@@ friendly corporate environment is no longer the only choice for working women .
many , particularly in the us , have left that world to start their own businesses .
most importantly , americans have a remarkable tendency to reduce problems that others addressed through public policy to a matter of private “ choice ” and even personal psychology .
but the real question is not whether “ women can have it all . ”
rather , it is how a sophisticated foreig@@ n-@@ policy professional can write as if countries like canada and the netherlands simply did not exist .
in canada , couples with a baby may sequence six-@@ month leaves of absence at up to 90 % pay .
in the netherlands – the best scenario i have seen yet – families can take a day off each week , and the government subsidi@@ zes full-time day@@ care .
this solution was not fra@@ med as a “ women ’ s issue , ” but as a family benefit .
and dutch women have simply moved on , focusing on other interesting goals in their personal and family lives .
in america , by contrast , the chamber of commerce and other business interests lobby hard to keep politicians from ever proposing such solutions .
they know that billions of dollars are made from hir@@ ing women at lower income levels than men , and then en@@ suring that a wor@@ k-@@ family conflict der@@ a@@ ils women ’ s careers before they become too expensive to compen@@ sa@@ te fairly .
of course , europe is not gen@@ der-@@ equality nir@@ vana .
in particular , the corporate workplace will never be completely famil@@ y-@@ friendly until women are part of senior management decisions , and europe ’ s top corpor@@ at@@ e-@@ governance positions remain overwhel@@ m@@ ingly male .
indeed , women hold only 14 % of positions on european corporate boards .
the european union is now considering legislation to compe@@ l corporate boards to maintain a certain proportion of women – up to 60 % .
this proposed mandate was born of frustration .
last year , european commission vice president vivi@@ ane re@@ ding issued a call to voluntary action .
re@@ ding invited corporations to sign up for gender balance goals of 40 % female board mem@@ ber@@ ship .
the for@@ te foundation in america has now followed suit with its own list of “ boar@@ d-@@ ready women . ”
but re@@ ding ’ s appeal in europe was considered a failure : only 24 companies took it up .
do we need quot@@ as to ensure that women can continue to climb the corporate ladder fairly as they balance work and family ?
“ personally , i don ’ t like quot@@ as , ” re@@ ding said recently .
“ but i like what the quot@@ as do . ”
quot@@ as get action : they “ open the way to equality and they break through the glass ceiling , ” according to re@@ ding , a result seen in france and other countries with legally bin@@ ding pro@@ visions on placing women in top business positions .
i understand re@@ ding ’ s re@@ tic@@ ence – and her frustration .
i don ’ t like quot@@ as either ; they run counter to my belief in merito@@ cracy .
but , when one consi@@ ders the obstacles to achieving the merito@@ cratic ideal , it does look as if a fair@@ er world must be tempor@@ arily mand@@ ated .
after all , four decades of evidence has now shown that corporations in europe as well as the us are ev@@ ading the merito@@ cratic hir@@ ing and promotion of women to top positions – no matter how much “ soft pressure ” is put upon them .
when women do break through to the summit of corporate power – as , for example , sher@@ yl sand@@ berg recently did at facebook – they gar@@ ner massive attention precisely because they remain the exception to the rule .
if appropriate public policies were in place to help all women – whether ceos or their children ’ s caregi@@ vers – and all families , sand@@ berg would be no more news@@ worthy than any other highly capable person living in a more just society .
and lam@@ ents like s@@ laughter ’ s would not be necessary .
wikileaks , secrets , and lies
singapore – the latest information dump from wikileaks offers fascinating insights into the work@@ ings of the us state department that will keep foreign policy won@@ ks and conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts busy for months .
much of what has been reported is not “ news ” in the traditional sense , of course , but a series of embarrassing ga@@ ff@@ es : truths that were never meant to be said al@@ oud .
underlying these various , and often banal , ti@@ d@@ bits of information – it should be no surprise that americans found italian prime minister sil@@ vi@@ o ber@@ lus@@ con@@ i “ va@@ in , ” or regarded zimbabwe ’ s robert mu@@ gabe as a “ crazy old man ” – is the larger question of whether governments should be able to keep secrets .
wikileaks founder julian as@@ san@@ ge argues that the answer is no , and that greater transparency “ creates a better society for all people . ”
this raises the question of why governments keep secrets at all , and whether those reasons are justi@@ fied .
the task of keeping a state ’ s secrets frequently falls to its intelligence services , which tend to focus on the protection of three types of information .
the first type is their own sources and methods , which need to be safe@@ guar@@ ded if they are to remain effective when gathering data .
when the washington times reported in 1998 that the national security agency was able to monitor osama bin laden ’ s satellite phone , for example , he stopped using it .
second , the identities and activities of a service ’ s operational staff should be with@@ held , so that they can do their jobs and to ensure their safety .
following wikileaks ’ release in july of tens of thousands of documents on the afghan war , a taliban spo@@ kes@@ man told british journalists that the group was “ studying the report ” with a view to identi@@ fying and pun@@ ishing anyone found to have collabor@@ ated with us forces .
third , information provided in confidence by foreign governments or intelligence services must be closely held to avoid embarrassing the provi@@ der of the information and thereby reducing the likelihood that information will be shared in future .
a lasting consequence of the most recent leak is circum@@ spe@@ ction when sharing intelligence with the united states .
in reality , of course , governments typically attempt to keep much more than this secret .
avoiding embarras@@ sment may at times be in the national interest , but it can also protect the careers of politicians and bureau@@ crats . in other circumstances , it may be p@@ ru@@ dent to avoid revealing how much – or how little – is known about a given situation .
wikileaks sees itself as part of the tradition in which the media hold governments accountable for abuse .
the role of the fourth estate was particularly important during the administration of president george w bush .
revel@@ ations of torture , extraordinary rendi@@ tion , and war@@ r@@ ant@@ less electronic surveillance all depended on investig@@ ative journalism of a kind that is now threatened by budget cuts and the media ’ s rel@@ ent@@ less focus on whatever is current – often at the expense of what is genuinely news@@ worthy .
but , whereas true investig@@ ative journalism depends on quality , wikileaks distingu@@ ishes itself by quantity .
the sheer volume of the data being dumped on the internet makes it impossible for thor@@ ough analysis or , indeed , for thor@@ ough exam@@ ination of potentially dama@@ ging information .
the threshold for exposure is no longer wrong@@ doing of the scale that coined the term “ water@@ gate ” and all the subsequ@@ ent “ -@@ gates . ”
instead , government officials are being war@@ ned that every document may potentially be le@@ aked and published worldwide by a dis@@ grun@@ tled junior officer .
the consequence is unlikely to be transparency .
per@@ ver@@ sely , it will lead to greater secre@@ cy .
the message that is almost certainly going through every major power is : be careful what you commit to writing .
in place of can@@ did assess@@ ments and provo@@ cative analysis , many important decisions will now be based on oral brief@@ ings and meetings that are not recorded in minutes .
decision-@@ makers will be war@@ y of openness even with their closest staff .
these changes are likely to out@@ last us secretary of state hillary clinton ’ s embarras@@ sment .
such self-@@ censorship will lead to worse decisions and less accountability for the decisions that are made .
it seems a high price to pay for gossi@@ p .
wiki@@ le@@ aky power
paris – beyond the headlines , the embarras@@ sment of governments , and the blow dealt to the secre@@ cy of diplo@@ matic correspon@@ dence , wikileaks ’ exposure of us diplo@@ matic cables offers a raw illustration of how deeply the essence of power has been altered in our information age .
since its in@@ ception , the state has been the main vessel of power ; access to power usually meant control of the state , whether by election or by violent take@@ over .
this model , within which individuals are subjects or , at best , taxpa@@ yers and voters , is being under@@ min@@ ed by several recent trends that have empowered the individual .
consider the internet , a network of connected nodes invented in the 1960 ’ s , at the height of the cold war , to preserve the united states from total chaos after a nuclear attack on its nerve centers .
it was deliberately constructed with no hierarchy , no core , and no central authority , though few at the time could have suspected where , given the numerous breakthroughs of the digital revolution , the internet ’ s buil@@ t-in trend toward decentralized power would lead .
it has led to the second trend : a me@@ tam@@ or@@ pho@@ sis of the production process .
information has become much more than a message conve@@ yed by technology ; it is now the raw material of ser@@ vic@@ es-@@ intensive advanced economies , and the building block of modern social and productive organizations .
the third trend concerns the room this has opened for individual and collective action .
in the human condition , the philosopher hannah ar@@ end@@ t linked politics to the human capacity not simply to act , but to “ act in concert . ”
while concer@@ ted action is a familiar notion , it used to be aimed mainly at influ@@ encing the state – exem@@ pli@@ fied by the way civil society promp@@ ted america ’ s with@@ dra@@ wal from vietnam .
today , however , collective action is of a different magnitude .
because of the univers@@ ality of the digital language , its ease of use , and the virtual absence of margin@@ al costs for producing or dissemin@@ ating information , the state ’ s tools of control have been weak@@ ened and deple@@ ted .
global finance has been one of the most eager bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ aries of these trends , using internet networks not just as a tool to conduct operations with greater efficiency and velocity , but also as a means to circum@@ vent state super@@ vision .
corporations have d@@ well@@ ed on connectivity to glob@@ alize their markets , r &amp; d , ownership , tax dom@@ i@@ ci@@ li@@ ation , and leadership , thorough@@ ly transforming their relationship with states , whether in their country of origin or elsewhere .
in september 1992 , it took george sor@@ os $ 10 billion to bring the bank of england to its knees and impose de@@ valu@@ ation on the pound .
it now takes only a computer and internet connection to cause serious trouble : in@@ tru@@ sion by hackers into protected networks , or the introduction of ha@@ voc@@ -@@ w@@ rea@@ king software viruses and worms in sensitive information systems .
while the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 – the dead@@ liest of all time – had nothing “ virtual ” about them , their perpetr@@ ator , al-qaeda , projects a cloud of threat and power by using cyberspace to promote its bloody “ successes , ” spread hatred , and recruit ji@@ ha@@ di@@ sts .
of course , access to a net@@ worked world has also balanced state power in positive ways , by giving a for@@ mid@@ able boost to independent advoc@@ acy , as seen in the online campaign to ban land@@ mines and the treaty that rati@@ fied its success – despite opposition by powerful states .
many similar organizations have flour@@ ished , gaining the ability to shape political outcomes and public policies .
but there is no place where the transformative power of connectivity is potentially greater than in china , with its reported 4@@ 20 million internet users .
no matter how eager china ’ s authorities are to keep the internet under their control – for example , by blocking foreign web sites – they are also aware of how much their economy now needs the internet .
as a result , the room for “ concer@@ ted action ” has never been so large for individual chinese to gain access to un@@ censor@@ ed information , share opinions , and communicate countr@@ y-@@ wide to expose official mis@@ conduct .
the nobel peace prize laure@@ ate li@@ u xia@@ obo was ja@@ iled for circul@@ ating on the internet his proposal for a truly democratic constitution , charter 0@@ 8 , which gathered 10,000 sig@@ natur@@ es online in only 24 hours .
in the late 1980 ’ s , glas@@ no@@ st – transparency – was one of the nails in the co@@ ff@@ in of the soviet union .
while wikileaks has certainly not had a similar effect , it epit@@ om@@ i@@ zes the extent of the individual ’ s empowerment in a net@@ worked world .
all that was necessary to challenge the world ’ s mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ est power , after all , was a dis@@ grun@@ tled us army intelligence analyst , some hacking knowledge , a few computers , and a handful of determined activists en@@ rolled under the con@@ tested ban@@ ner of transparency .
this drive promp@@ ted us secretary of state hillary clinton in january 2010 to pro@@ claim the “ freedom to connect ” as the cyber-@@ equivalent of the more familiar freedoms of assembly or expression .
of course , clinton added , these technologies are not an un@@ mi@@ tig@@ ated blessing , and can be mis@@ used for dar@@ ker purposes .
but her list of the potential ab@@ uses of the connected world contained nothing similar to the wikileaks storm .
that storm will leave behind no trace of understanding if it is ass@@ essed in isolation , rather than as part of a broader pattern .
wikileaks ’ latest release demonstrates that the transformation of power by the “ digital revolution ” could be as far-@@ reaching as that brought about by the fif@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ century printing revolution .
in this game , where new players invite themselves , the edge goes to agi@@ lity and innovation .
all of this impli@@ es that connectedness will remain a double-@@ ed@@ ged s@@ word – the leverage it provides being frau@@ ght with vulnerability .
and that means that we can count on more surprises in store for states .
wild about risk
most people do not feel the same impulse to go out and buy insurance , or diversi@@ fy their investments , as they do to buy a sofa or new clothes .
they should , but they don &apos;t .
insurance , investment , and banking institutions have historically had to fight an uph@@ ill battle to get individuals , businesses , and government to pay for risk management .
their successes , while impressive , remain incomplete : people still have difficulty facing the inherent risks and un@@ certain@@ ties about their economic future .
this is why almost every advanced country has mand@@ atory social security and health insurance programs .
of course , people are not really unaware of life &apos;s big risks .
we simply ignore them for reasons that are rooted in human psychology .
the link between intellectual recognition of risks and the im@@ pe@@ tus to act against them is medi@@ ated by fear : we have been programmed over millions of years of evolution to take decisi@@ ve action against immediate and obvious threats .
if a men@@ ac@@ ing wild animal approaches , we feel fear and anxiety .
adrenal@@ ine flows , our attention is foc@@ us@@ sed , and our instinct to protect friends and family ar@@ oused .
but more remote risks simply do not stimulate our emotions , so we often post@@ pone taking action in@@ definitely .
we are also more afraid of well-@@ publi@@ ci@@ zed risks - especially those that can kill us in gr@@ is@@ ly ways .
after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the us , many americans drove to distant locations rather than fly , even though statistics showed that flying remained far safer .
meanwhile , many of these same people were probably among the millions of americans who didn &apos;t get an annual medical check@@ -up .
measuring risks , especially important long-term ones , is im@@ precise and difficult .
virtually none of the economic statistics reported in the media measure risk .
to fully compre@@ hend risk , we must stretch our imagination to think of all the different ways that things can go wrong , including things that have not happened in recent memory .
we must protect ourselves against fall@@ ac@@ ies , such as thinking that just because a risk has not proved dama@@ ging for decades , it no longer exists .
yet another psychological barrier is a sort of ego involvement in our own success .
our tendency to take full credit for our successes dis@@ coura@@ ges us from facing up to the possibility of loss or failure , because considering such pro@@ spe@@ cts calls into question our self-@@ satisfaction .
indeed , self-esteem is one of the most powerful human needs : a view of our own success relative to others provides us with a sense of meaning and well-being .
so accepting the essential randomness of life is terribly difficult , and contradi@@ cts our deep psychological need for order and accountability .
we often do not protect the things that we have - such as our opportunities to earn income and accumulate wealth - because we mista@@ ken@@ ly believe that our own natural super@@ i@@ ority will do that for us .
this tendency is especially apparent when it comes to public policy .
government leaders find it hard to address economic risks to the nation because it is im@@ poli@@ tic to call into question the self-esteem of their constitu@@ ency .
but no one who looks at the matter seriously can argue that the tremendous inequality between the world &apos;s nations reflects fundamental differences in inherent ability or im@@ mu@@ table character .
the per capita gdp of india in 2000 , for example , was only 7 % of that of the us .
can anyone believe that this is because americans are 14 times smarter or 14 times better in character than indians ?
obviously , these two countries &apos; relative positions are due to circumstances that can be changed , or that will change in response to economic events and political decisions .
but the leaders of the world &apos;s rich countries have great difficulty addressing risks to their relative success vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis less developed countries , because national self-esteem is too tied up with it .
citizens in advanced countries just can &apos;t believe - and don &apos;t want to be told - that their privileged status may be dissi@@ p@@ ated unless proper steps are taken to in@@ sure against the risks they face .
for example , the world &apos;s advanced countries are sc@@ arc@@ ely less dependent on oil today than they were in 1973 , when the opec embar@@ go sti@@ fl@@ ed their economies and sent prices so@@ aring .
most companies are no better at managing or even recognizing the different kinds of economic risks that their workers face .
many maintain insurance and pen@@ sions for their employees , but also encourage their workers to trust the company to provide for them forever , and even to invest in the company &apos;s stock .
when an employee is laid off in middle age , or the company goes bank@@ rupt , the suddenly materi@@ alized risk may come as a shock .
clearly , establi@@ shing mand@@ atory social security and health insurance programs , and a social safety net for the poor , has helped he@@ dge the most fundamental risks that people face .
the problem is the lack of any coherent policy for en@@ suring that individuals are protected against a broader array of economic risks to their incomes , investments , and homes .
so new risk management institutions need to be de@@ vised .
they should use markets , rather than state guarante@@ es , and while they should not be mand@@ atory , they must be designed in accor@@ dance with humans &apos; psychological limitations , so that people will use them .
we know enough about risk perception to recognize that helping people cope with the risks of modern life requires addressing their hearts as well as their heads .
a virtu@@ ous cycle for conservation
new york – poor and rural people around the world rely on plants and animals for shelter , food , income , and medicine .
in fact , the united nations sustainable development goal ( s@@ dg 15 ) on sustainable ecosystems acknowled@@ ges many developing societies ’ close relationship with nature when it calls for increased “ capacity of local communities to pursue sustainable live@@ lihood opportunities . ”
but how is this to be achieved ?
the 1975 convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fa@@ una and fl@@ ora ( c@@ ites ) provides a viable framework for reducing poverty while also conser@@ ving nature .
it regul@@ ates the harvesting and exchange of more than 3@@ 5,000 wildlife species across a range of lo@@ cal@@ es .
nature has been described as the “ gdp of the poor . ”
the c@@ ites framework , combined with strong national conservation policies , can simultaneously protect wild species and benefit poor , rural , and indigenous people , by encouraging countries and communities to adopt sound environmental management plans .
for example , under c@@ ites , andes communities s@@ hear the vi@@ cu@@ ñ@@ a for its fine wo@@ ol , which they sell to the luxury fashion industry in other parts of the world .
camer@@ o@@ oni@@ ans collect african cher@@ ry bar@@ k for export to european pharmaceutical companies .
and people on the tibet@@ an plat@@ e@@ au in bhutan make a living selling cat@@ er@@ pill@@ ar fungus to the tradition@@ al-@@ medicine industry .
however , outside of c@@ ites , limited guidance is available to ensure that legal trade is sustainable and beneficial to the poor .
sustainable trade often depends on poor and rural communities conser@@ ving their own resources at the local level .
to see what that looks like , the international trade center ( it@@ c ) recently examined how people in southeast asia sustain@@ ably manage the cit@@ es-@@ listed pyth@@ on trade .
pyth@@ on skins are commonly used as raw material in the luxury fashion industry , and it@@ c surveys of pyth@@ on-@@ skin harvest@@ ers , farmers , processors , and expor@@ ters in vietnam and malaysia found that the trade rein@@ forces live@@ lihood resilience by providing an additional source of income .
in vietnam , an estimated 1,000 households farm and trade pyth@@ ons , and pyth@@ on harvesting in malaysia provides incomes for low-@@ skilled , low-income workers during periods when other employment opportunities are either out of season , or simply scarce because of larger economic factors .
researchers found that most of those harvesting pyth@@ ons implement simple and effective sustain@@ ab@@ le-@@ management plans , and that this has reduced pressure on wild populations .
however , pyth@@ on skins , like many wildlife products , are a commodity , so communities harvesting them are limited in terms of how they can add value to increase returns .
women in the per@@ u@@ vi@@ an andes may clean vi@@ cu@@ ñ@@ a wo@@ ol by hand to increase the price it fe@@ tches per kilogra@@ m by $ 50 , whereas selling a wo@@ ol@@ -@@ scarf could yield them $ 15@@ 0-@@ 200 ; a malay@@ si@@ an pyth@@ on skin sells for $ 200 , while a pyth@@ on-@@ skin bag could sell for $ 2,000 .
still , some emerging countries are moving up the value chain and re@@ taining a greater share of returns , as demonstrated by local brands such as kun@@ a , which markets al@@ pac@@ a and vi@@ cu@@ ñ@@ a wo@@ ol in peru , and natur@@ a , a brazilian natur@@ al-@@ cos@@ me@@ tic brand .
the biggest threats to the legal wildlife trade are po@@ aching , smug@@ gling , impro@@ per trade per@@ mit@@ ting , and animal abuse , all of which must be addressed by regul@@ ators and rural community stake@@ holders at the local level .
fortunately , rural communities are already in the best position to protect wildlife , so long as they are motivated to do so .
in the right circumstances , a virtu@@ ous cycle , where@@ by local producers have a direct interest in protecting wildlife ( because they are benef@@ iting from its legal trade ) is the best – and sometimes the only – long-term solution to the problem of sustainability .
to help with this , governments can increase rural communities ’ resour@@ ce@@ - and wild@@ life-@@ use rights so that they can manage and protect their natural resources sustain@@ ably .
for example , in the 1970s when peru granted an@@ dean communities the right to use vi@@ cu@@ ñ@@ a wo@@ ol , it saved the vi@@ cu@@ ñ@@ a from extinction and created new , long-term income streams for the community .
because legal and natural circumstances vary by country and community , we will need similar policy innovations across different sectors .
one promising sector is tourism , which also fits into the c@@ ites framework .
to take one example , since rwanda began sharing wild@@ life-@@ tourism revenues with local communities , the mountain@@ -@@ gorilla population has grown .
as we see time and again , when local communities are included , they can become resol@@ ute wildlife defen@@ ders .
more generally , we should be supporting scientists working on new adap@@ tiv@@ e-@@ management methods , and the private sector should be given incentives to invest in greater sustainable sourcing and increased sup@@ pl@@ y@@ - and produ@@ c@@ tion-@@ chain transparency .
as the examples above show , conservation and improved live@@ li@@ hoods for the rural poor are feasi@@ ble , and even mutually rein@@ forcing .
with more political will and smart investments , there is no reason we can ’ t reach the s@@ d@@ gs to both reduce poverty and safe@@ guard wildlife for future generations .
last year , the un passed an historic resolution to tackle il@@ lic@@ it wildlife trafficking , recognizing the effectiveness of the c@@ ites legal framework .
the resolution calls on the 18@@ 2 c@@ ites member countries to protect the interests of wildlife as well as to provide tangible benefits for the poor and rural communities .
we hope that dele@@ gates from those member countries meeting at the world wildlife conference in south africa are hearing that call .
new york – in their efforts to pass a bail@@ out plan for america ’ s financial system , bush administration officials inv@@ o@@ ked the spec@@ ter of the great depression of the 19@@ 30 ’ s .
but , for most asi@@ ans , economic arma@@ ge@@ d@@ don is far more recent .
the asian financial crisis of a decade ago brought banks , corporations and governments to their knees .
the bon@@ fire was spar@@ ked by the collapse of the thai ba@@ ht in the summer of 1997 .
contagi@@ on soon spread across east asia , with the ri@@ pple effects of serial currency de@@ valu@@ ations reaching as far as russia and brazil .
the long-@@ running “ economic miracles ” of south korea and hong kong ended , as did sur@@ ging growth in indonesia and thailand .
the central lesson taken from that crisis was to maintain large foreig@@ n-@@ exchange reserves .
this became a virtual article of faith among east asian governments .
back in the 1990 ’ s , asia ’ s fast-@@ growing economies main@@ tained small reserves , despite boom@@ ing exports and foreign investment .
once the tail@@ spin began in 1997 , governments ’ lack of reserves ham@@ per@@ ed their ability to rescue failed banks , forcing them to appeal to international institutions for relief .
but the international mon@@ etary fund ’ s bail@@ out came with strings attached , including demands for more of the rapid capital market liber@@ alization that induced the crisis in the first place .
indeed , what the west calls the “ asian financial crisis ” is known in asia as the “ imf crisis . ”
the political humili@@ ation and economic frustration of dealing with imf imper@@ atives confir@@ med the central importance of maintaining large reserves , as an issue not just of currency stability , but also economic sovereig@@ n@@ ty .
one asian economy emerged from the 199@@ 7-@@ 1998 crisis relatively uns@@ ca@@ th@@ ed : china .
there were many reasons for this , but foremost among them was that china had already a@@ mas@@ sed more than $ 100 billion in reserves , and refused to re@@ value its currency , when the crisis hit .
since then , china has aggressi@@ vely pursu@@ ed a fast-@@ growth , export , and investment heavy model of economic development .
by ca@@ pping the exchange rate and producing far more than it consu@@ mes , china ’ s reserves grew into a leviathan , hitting the $ 1 trillion mark in 2005 .
even after china ( under pressure from us treas@@ ury officials ) let the yu@@ an partially float in 2005 , the leviathan kept growing by about $ 200 billion annu@@ ally .
over the past year and a half , china ’ s reserves sky@@ rock@@ eted to $ 1.@@ 8 trillion , far and away the world ’ s largest .
the chinese state probably hasn ’ t sat on so much lu@@ c@@ re since the hal@@ cy@@ on days of the q@@ ing empire , when in@@ sati@@ able european demand for por@@ cel@@ ain , tea and silk floo@@ ded the central co@@ ff@@ ers in beijing with silver bu@@ lli@@ on .
but the paradox is that today ’ s reserves are not real wealth that can be pump@@ ed back into the domestic economy .
instead , china ’ s reserves mostly under@@ write america ’ s debt .
even before wall street hit the ski@@ ds , there was growing consensus in china that its reserves had grown far beyond what was necessary to aver@@ t another 199@@ 7-@@ style crisis .
calls for a more diversi@@ fied investment strategy intensi@@ fied .
investing in us treas@@ u@@ ries , after all , was a sure los@@ s-@@ maker , given the gap between their modest yield and the steady appreciation of the yu@@ an .
with the creation one year ago of a $ 200 billion sovereig@@ n wealth fund , the china investment corporation , beijing posi@@ tioned itself for more equity investment ( although its early investments , in the black@@ stone group and morgan stanley , were widely criticized ) .
economist andy x@@ ie , for@@ mer@@ ly with morgan stanley , proposed last week that china trade its dollar assets for shares in us companies on a grand scale , challenging america to overcome its financial xen@@ opho@@ bia in order to aver@@ t a disaster of under@@ capit@@ alization .
but many in china , from nation@@ alist bloggers to social justice activists , advance a deeper cri@@ ti@@ que of the leviathan reserve .
why bind up chinese capital to finance america ’ s deb@@ t-@@ consumption economy , they ask , when so many needs go un@@ met at home ?
china was one of the world ’ s most egal@@ itarian societies as late as 1985 .
today , it suffers one of the world ’ s biggest gaps between ha@@ ves and ha@@ ve-@@ n@@ ots .
chines@@ e-@@ style capitalism is fla@@ unting its defi@@ ance of one con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us ’ basic teach@@ ings — don ’ t worry about poverty , he war@@ ned , worry about inequality .
china ’ s physical infrastructure in boom@@ ing central cities is under@@ going radical moderni@@ zation , but the social and environmental infrastructure is falling apart , especially in the interior and for the huge rural population .
for years , the central government has talked about creating “ social harmony ” — with a “ new@@ -@@ type rural cooperative medical services system , ” by increasing spending on education to 4 % of gdp and eliminating school fees , and imple@@ menting “ sustainable development ” models .
the promises are grand , but the actions have not measured up .
and the economic costs of restricted access to healthcare and education , on top of the scarcity of clear air and po@@ table water , will be cri@@ p@@ pling in the mid- and long-term .
the challenge for china in the years to come is to di@@ v@@ est itself of american debt , and begin investing in the health , education and environmental well-being of its own people .
growing the economy at an average annual rate of 10 % , it turns out , may have been the easy part .
will banks and financial markets recover in 2009 ?
new york – global financial markets in 2008 experienced their worst crisis since the great depression of the 19@@ 30 ’ s .
major financial institutions went bust ; others were bought up on the cheap or survived only after major bail@@ outs .
global stock markets fell by more than 50 % ; interest@@ -@@ rate spreads sky@@ rock@@ eted ; a severe liqui@@ dity and credit crun@@ ch appeared ; and many emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market economies stag@@ gered to the international mon@@ etary fund for help .
so what lies ahead in 2009 ?
is the worst behind us or ahead of us ?
to answer these questions , we must understand that a vicious circle of economic contra@@ ction and wor@@ sen@@ ing financial conditions is underway .
the united states will certainly experience its worst recession in decades , a deep and pro@@ tra@@ cted contra@@ ction lasting about 24 months through the end of 2009 .
moreover , the entire global economy will contract .
there will be recession in the euro zone , the united kingdom , contin@@ ental europe , canada , japan , and the other advanced economies .
there is also a risk of a hard landing for emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market economies , as trade , financial , and currency links transmit real and financial sho@@ cks to them .
in the advanced economies , recession had brought back earlier in 2008 fears of 1970 ’ s-@@ style stag@@ f@@ lation ( a combination of economic stag@@ nation and inflation ) .
but , with aggregate demand falling below growing aggregate supply , sl@@ ack goods markets will lead to lower inflation as firms ’ pricing power is restra@@ ined .
likewise , rising unemployment will control labor costs and wage growth .
these factors , combined with shar@@ ply falling commodity prices , will cause inflation in advanced economies to ease toward the 1 % level , raising concerns about def@@ lation , not stag@@ f@@ lation .
def@@ lation is dangerous as it leads to a liqui@@ dity trap : nomin@@ al policy rates cannot fall below zero , so mon@@ etary policy becomes in@@ effective .
falling prices mean that the real cost of capital is high and the real value of nomin@@ al deb@@ ts rise , leading to further dec@@ lines in consumption and investment – and thus setting in motion a vicious circle in which incomes and jobs are squee@@ zed further , ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ating the fall in demand and prices .
as traditional mon@@ etary policy becomes in@@ effective , other un@@ orthodo@@ x policies will continue to be used : policies to ba@@ il out investors , financial institutions , and bor@@ ro@@ wers ; massive pro@@ vision of liqui@@ dity to banks in order to ease the credit crun@@ ch ; and even more radical actions to reduce long-term interest rates on government bonds and narrow the spread between market rates and government bonds .
today ’ s global crisis was triggered by the collapse of the us housing bubble , but it was not caused by it .
america ’ s credit ex@@ cess@@ es were in residential mort@@ g@@ ages , commercial mort@@ g@@ ages , credit cards , auto loans , and student loans .
there was also excess in the se@@ curi@@ tized products that converted these deb@@ ts into toxic financial deriva@@ tives ; in borrowing by local governments ; in finan@@ cing for lever@@ aged bu@@ you@@ ts that should never have occurred ; in corporate bonds that will now suffer massive losses in a surge of de@@ faul@@ ts ; in the dangerous and un@@ regulated credit default swap market .
moreover , these path@@ ologies were not confined to the us .
there were housing bubbles in many other countries , fu@@ eled by exc@@ essive cheap len@@ ding that did not reflect underlying risks .
there was also a commodity bubble and a private equity and he@@ dge funds bubble .
indeed , we now see the de@@ mise of the shadow banking system , the complex of non-@@ bank financial institutions that looked like banks as they bor@@ rowed short term and in liquid ways , lever@@ aged a lot , and invested in longer term and il@@ liquid ways .
as a result , the biggest asset and credit bubble in human history is now going bust , with overall credit losses likely to be close to a staggering $ 2 trillion .
thus , unless governments rapidly recap@@ it@@ alize financial institutions , the credit crun@@ ch will become even more severe as losses mount faster than recap@@ it@@ alization and banks are forced to contract credit and len@@ ding .
equity prices and other risky assets have fallen shar@@ ply from their peaks of late 2007 , but there are still significant down@@ side risks .
an emerging consensus suggests that the prices of many risky assets – including equi@@ ties – have fallen so much that we are at the bottom and a rapid recovery will occur .
but the worst is still ahead of us .
in the next few months , the macro@@ economic news and ear@@ nings / profits reports from around the world will be much worse than expected , putting further down@@ ward pressure on prices of risky assets , because equity analy@@ sts are still delu@@ ding themselves that the economic contra@@ ction will be mild and short .
while the risk of a total systemic financial mel@@ t@@ down has been reduced by the actions of the g-@@ 7 and other economies to back@@ stop their financial systems , severe vulner@@ abilities remain .
the credit crun@@ ch will get worse ; dele@@ ver@@ aging will continue , as he@@ dge funds and other lever@@ aged players are forced to sell assets into il@@ liquid and dist@@ ressed markets , thus causing more price falls and driving more in@@ sol@@ vent financial institutions out of business .
a few emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market economies will certainly enter a full-@@ blown financial crisis .
so 2009 will be a painful year of global recession and further financial stres@@ ses , losses , and bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cies .
only aggressive , coordinated , and effective policy actions by advanced and emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market countries can ensure that the global economy reco@@ vers in 2010 , rather than entering a more pro@@ tra@@ cted period of economic stag@@ nation .
europe ’ s un@@ ending ber@@ lus@@ con@@ i problem
he may not wish to be king again , but he certainly can be a king@@ maker , o@@ wing to his control of medi@@ as@@ et , italy ’ s largest media group .
and , given his aby@@ s@@ mal popul@@ arity ratings , he may decide to play the wild card , embrace a euro@@ -@@ skeptic and anti-@@ government stance , and try to bring down prime minister mari@@ o mon@@ ti ’ s techno@@ cratic administration .
mon@@ ti ’ s government took over from ber@@ lus@@ con@@ i in november 2011 , arriving with a clear mandate , and full parli@@ am@@ entary support , to implement the measures needed to restore market confidence and reas@@ sure italy ’ s euro@@ zone partners and the international mon@@ etary fund that the country was not going down the path taken by greece .
at the time of the g-@@ 20 summit in can@@ nes that month , italy – and europe – was danger@@ ously close to collapse , with ber@@ lus@@ con@@ i ’ s government deeply divided about the fiscal measures needed to bring down the country ’ s deb@@ t-@@ service costs .
domestic political dead@@ lock , and ber@@ lus@@ con@@ i ’ s inability to engage with germany and france resulted in spir@@ aling re@@ finan@@ cing costs , with the spread relative to german b@@ unds consistently over 500 basis points between july and november 2011 .
the mon@@ ti government has restored market confidence and italy ’ s international credi@@ bility .
but the overall picture remains fragile .
the interest@@ -@@ rate spread has stabili@@ zed around a more manage@@ able 300 basis points , but is still higher than it was three years ago .
in addition , italy ’ s economic out@@ look remains highly un@@ certain .
indeed , the modest economic recovery that should benefit many countries in 2013 seems to be elu@@ ding italy .
according to the imf , the economy will remain in recession next year , and , though the rate of contra@@ ction will be less severe than in 2012 ( -@@ 0.@@ 7 % in 2013 , compared to -@@ 2.@@ 3 % this year ) , the unemployment rate is expected to rise further , from 10@@ .@@ 6 % to 1@@ 1.@@ 1 % .
more needs to be done in order to support economic growth in the short term , improve the country ’ s fiscal position in the medium term , and implement the structural reforms needed to make the italian economy more robust and internation@@ ally competitive in the long term .
italy is ran@@ ked 4@@ 3@@ rd in the world economic forum ’ s global competi@@ tiveness index , well below the main euro@@ zone countries , o@@ wing to lack of investment – especially in human capital – and structural rigi@@ di@@ ties that have constrained growth for many years .
the answer to italy ’ s economic problems is not , as ber@@ lus@@ con@@ i advoc@@ ates , an exit from the euro@@ zone and a return to the flexibility of its own currency , which in the past allowed policymakers to boost competi@@ tiveness through ir@@ responsible de@@ valu@@ ations .
italy needs to learn how to live with the euro and within the euro@@ zone , which means adopting policies that ensure that productivity growth and innovation , not currency de@@ valu@@ ation , are the main drivers of competi@@ tiveness .
a stable , competent , and responsible government with a comfortable parli@@ am@@ entary majority is essential to continue what mon@@ ti ’ s government has initi@@ ated .
while the odds still favor a relatively smooth transition , many un@@ certain@@ ties could der@@ a@@ il the reform process .
in particular , whether italy will be able to move beyond techno@@ cratic politics to a “ normal ” government remains the out@@ standing question both at home and for the other euro@@ zone member states .
from this perspective , what ber@@ lus@@ con@@ i advoc@@ ates for italy , and the consequences of his agenda for the euro@@ zone , is not good news .
any hint that the country may be locked again in parli@@ am@@ entary iner@@ tia , as in the final months of ber@@ lus@@ con@@ i ’ s last government , would push the markets to question the credi@@ bility of italy ’ s fis@@ cal@@ -@@ con@@ soli@@ dation plan , je@@ opar@@ di@@ zing the country ’ s ability to re@@ finance its debt .
that debt is the largest in the euro@@ zone – at roughly € 2 trillion ( $ 2.@@ 6 trillion ) , or 120 % of the country ’ s gdp – which means that italy can be helped , but not rescued .
with potential inst@@ ability lo@@ oming , mon@@ ti should ensure that italy is not defen@@ sel@@ ess in the event of another round of market inst@@ ability .
unlike some months ago , now the european central bank can intervene and buy troubled countries ’ debt .
but this mechanism can be activated only by formal request .
italy should follow this route without delay .
it is better to have a powerful weapon that may gather dust than to be un@@ armed in a time of need .
will britain choose ir@@ relevance ?
london – when voters in the united kingdom go to the polls on june 23 to decide whether their country should leave the european union , the issues they will have to reck@@ on with will include the impact of their decision on unemployment , trade flows , and the stability of financial markets .
but there are other less quantifi@@ able consider@@ ations that must also be weighed in the balance .
the economic arguments against a british exit from the eu – or bre@@ x@@ it – have been well rehear@@ sed .
many have suggested that if the uk were to leave , manufacturers would secure continued access to the european market by fle@@ eing across the english channel , co@@ sting the country millions of jobs .
similarly , with@@ dra@@ wal from the eu risks under@@ mining london ’ s position as a global financial center , which depends on the city ’ s integration into european markets .
another area of concern for many voters regar@@ ds the uk ’ s sovereig@@ n@@ ty – the idea that independent countries should have ultimate decision-making authority over what happens within their borders .
mem@@ ber@@ ship in the eu sometimes requires ce@@ ding control to a complex web of of@@ ten-@@ inefficient brus@@ sel@@ s-@@ based supr@@ an@@ ational institutions .
i hold a doc@@ tor@@ ate in economics and work with businesses whose employees and operations benefit from the uk ’ s mem@@ ber@@ ship in the eu .
i also have a pronoun@@ ced dis@@ da@@ in for red tape and in@@ efficiency .
and yet i do not believe that economic consider@@ ations or concerns about sovereig@@ n@@ ty offer compelling arguments for bre@@ x@@ it .
much more important is the potential impact of such a decision on the uk ’ s global standing .
mem@@ ber@@ ship in a european community of 500 million people provides the uk with consider@@ able influence over geo@@ politics and the global economy .
as the world becomes ever more daunting and complex , maintaining that influence is clearly in the country ’ s interest .
the refer@@ end@@ um campaign is playing out against a global economic and political back@@ drop that is nothing if not fore@@ bo@@ ding .
the international mon@@ etary fund has war@@ ned that global growth is unlikely to return to the levels that it atta@@ ined before the 2008 financial crisis .
indeed , the global consul@@ ting firm mck@@ inse@@ y predicts that global growth rates during the next 50 years will be half of what they were over the previous five decades .
meanwhile , martin de@@ mp@@ sey , a retired army general and former chair@@ man of the us joint chie@@ fs of staff , has said that the world has entered the most dangerous period he has ever witnessed .
developing countries are home to roughly 90 % of the world ’ s population , and some two-thirds of their residents are younger than 25 .
stag@@ nant growth or shrinking output in many emerging economies has serious consequences .
the uk ’ s overseas development institute predicts that by 20@@ 25 , roughly 80 % of the world ’ s poor will live in fragile states .
job@@ -@@ ero@@ ding technological advances , wor@@ sen@@ ing income inequality , demographic shifts , d@@ wind@@ ling natural resources , and environmental deple@@ tion are adding even more stra@@ ws to the camel ’ s back .
the world is already under@@ going the worst refugee crisis since the end of world war ii , with some 60 million people having been driven from their homes .
the moun@@ ting inst@@ ability will only exac@@ erb@@ ate the problem .
leaving the eu will not shield the uk from the vag@@ aries of the global economy .
it will only depri@@ ve the country of a leading voice in shaping the response to new and existing challenges .
the uk is far better placed to influence the global policy agenda from inside the eu than from outside it .
to be sure , leaving the eu would not strip the uk of its historical promin@@ ence in international organizations – most not@@ ably its permanent mem@@ ber@@ ship of the united nations ’ security council .
but a non-@@ european britain would be less likely to secure the same standing and influence in whatever institutions emerge in the years ahead .
within the eu , the uk is a critical part of an influential economic and political blo@@ c with un@@ deni@@ able he@@ ft .
ampli@@ fied by the eu , its voice can influence world events , providing the country with what the british like to describe as an ability to punch above its weight .
should the uk leave , however , its influence would be limited to its true size on the global stage : a relatively small country with limited economic and political power .
as british voters prepare to cast their ball@@ ots , they should weigh carefully the consequences of international ir@@ relevance .
will can@@ cu@@ n promote or under@@ mine development ?
from september 10-@@ 14 , trade ministers from around the world will meet for the next stage of what is supposed to be the development round of trade talks .
at their last meeting in doha in november 2001 , ministers recognized the ine@@ qui@@ ties of the previous round of trade negotiations , the uruguay round .
this round was supposed to red@@ ress those im@@ balances .
one would have thought that the developing countries would look forward to the meeting as a chance to achieve a fair@@ er global trading system .
instead , many fear that what has happened in the past will happen again : secret negotiations , arm twi@@ sting , and the display of br@@ ute economic power by the us and europe@@ -@@ -@@ and by special interests in the advanced coun@@ tri@@ es-@@ -@@ aimed at en@@ suring that the interests of the rich are protected .
while some progress has been made in making the negotiations more open and transparent , efforts to go further have met with resistance , and for good reason : un@@ balanced processes help ensure un@@ balanced outcomes .
ironically , the world trade organization , where each country has one vote , might seem far more `@@ `@@ democratic &apos; &apos; than , say , the imf , where a single country , the us , has a ve@@ to .
yet the real@@ politik of economic power has en@@ su@@ red that the interests of the developed countries pre@@ dominate .
here is a short checklist against which to ass@@ ess whether the outcomes of can@@ cu@@ n represent a move towards a true development round .
· agriculture .
most people in the developing world live in the rural sector , which is why free and fair trade in agriculture matters .
it &apos;s not just a question of providing access , but of eliminating the subsidies that encourage production in rich countries and harm farmers in poor countries .
although both europe and america acc@@ use each other of unfair agricultural policies , neither side seems willing to make major conc@@ essions .
· drugs and intellectual property . trips , the intellectual property regime adopted in the last round of trade negotiations , depri@@ ved millions in the developing world of access to life-saving drugs .
as a chor@@ us of researchers has pointed out , the pro@@ visions , pushed by the pharmaceutical companies , were so un@@ balanced that they were bad for scientific progress .
here , there has been some pro@@ gress@@ -@@ -@@ but not enough .
pro@@ visions demand@@ ed by the us would have made it difficult for small countries , like botswana , to gain affordable access .
developing countries also continue to worry about bio-@@ pi@@ ra@@ cy@@ -@@ -@@ the pat@@ enting by western firms of traditional foods and drugs .
· tex@@ tiles .
the uruguay round promised the elimin@@ ation of quot@@ as in 2004 , enabling many developing countries to exploit another area of compar@@ ative advantage .
but many developing countries worry that trade restri@@ ctions will remain , whether through `@@ `@@ safe@@ guards &apos; &apos; to protect jobs or through high tari@@ ffs .
many also fear that the west will find some way to wi@@ g@@ gle out of its commit@@ ments .
· a more balanced liber@@ alization agenda .
with services com@@ prising an increasing share of production in developed countries , attention has shifted to liber@@ alization of trade in services .
a more balanced agenda would balance attempts to ease capital flows with efforts to facili@@ tate the flow of labor , including uns@@ killed labor .
· competition .
everyone advoc@@ ates `@@ `@@ fair competition . &apos; &apos;
but discussions about competition and fair trade again demonstrate the intellectual poverty and ine@@ qu@@ ity of trade negotiations .
anti-@@ dumping laws are intended to ensure fair trade by preventing the sale of goods below cost .
within the developed countries , there has long been concern about such behavi@@ or-@@ -@@ so-called `@@ `@@ pre@@ dation &apos; &apos; -@@ -@@ and well-@@ defined standards have been developed .
with globalization , it would be natural to extend such principles to the international arena , making it irrelevant whether a producer is domestic or foreign when jud@@ ging whether he is engaged in an unfair trade practice .
but it does make a difference whether a good is produced at home or abroad .
foreign producers are accused of `@@ `@@ unfair &apos; &apos; competition far more easily than domestic producers .
indeed , if the standards of domestic trade laws were applied internation@@ ally , perhaps a majority of firms within the us would be guilty of dumping .
yet america &apos;s supreme court has set standards so high for american firms to be found guilty of pre@@ dation that few cases are successfully pro@@ secu@@ ted domest@@ ically .
the trade negoti@@ ators are not even discussing eliminating this double standard .
so developing countries worry that efforts to introduce `@@ `@@ competition &apos; &apos; within trade negotiations will only make life even more difficult .
they worry that efforts to promote domestic industries or provide prefer@@ ential treatment to dis@@ advanta@@ ged groups ( the kind of affir@@ ma@@ tive action programs that have been so important , both in developed and less developed countries ) will be labeled `@@ `@@ unfair &apos; &apos; to foreign firms , and thus be prohi@@ bited .
there is a real danger that what was intended to reme@@ dy the im@@ balances of previous trade ro@@ unds will not only fail to do so , but may introduce new im@@ balances .
pushing countries to liber@@ alize their capital markets and open them up to specu@@ lative capital flows is one example .
at the very moment when the imf has finally recognized that such liber@@ alization may produce inst@@ ability but not growth , the w@@ to is now pursuing it .
failure at can@@ cu@@ n would confirm the fears of those who resi@@ sted a new round of trade negotiations .
needless to say , it would also provide support for the anti-@@ globalization prote@@ stors everywhere .
will cap@@ -and-@@ trade inci@@ te prote@@ c@@ tion@@ ism ?
cambridge ­ – there is a serious danger that the international adoption of cap@@ -and-@@ trade legislation to limit carbon-@@ dioxide emissions will trigger a new round of prote@@ c@@ tionist measures .
while aimed at reducing long-term environmental damage , cap@@ -and-@@ trade policies could produce significant harmful economic effects in the near term that would continue into the future .
scientific evidence appears to indicate that the accumulation of co2 in the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels ( primarily coal , oil , and natural gas ) – mainly in electricity production , transportation , and various industrial processes – contributes to gradu@@ al global warming , with long-term ad@@ verse effects on living conditions around the world .
it is with this in mind that representatives of more than 150 countries are scheduled to meet in copenhagen in december to discuss ways to reduce co2 emissions .
a common suggestion is to impose a tax on all co2 emissions , which would be levi@@ ed on companies that e@@ mit co2 in production , or that sell products like gasoline that cause co2 emissions when used .
such a tax would cause electricity companies and industrial firms to adopt techniques that reduce their co2 emissions , as long as the cost of doing so is less than the tax that they would otherwise have to pay .
the higher cost of production in@@ cur@@ red to reduce emissions – and of any emissions tax still due – would , of course , be included in the price charged to consumers .
consumers would respond to the ta@@ x-@@ induced increase in the cost of the emis@@ sion@@ s-@@ intensive products by reducing their consumption of those goods and services in favor of goods and services that create smaller amounts of co2 emissions .
a carbon tax causes each firm and household to respond to the same cost of adding co2 to the atmosphere .
that uniform individual cost incentive allows total co2 to be reduced at a lower total cost than would be achieved by a variety of administra@@ tive requirements , such as automobile mile@@ age standards , production technology standards ( e.@@ g. , minimum renewable fuel inputs in electricity generation ) , etc .
although governments le@@ vy taxes on gasoline , they are reluctant to impose a general carbon tax because of public opposition to any form of tax@@ ation .
governments have therefore focused on a cap@@ -and-@@ trade system as a way of increasing the cost of co2-@@ intensive products without explicitly im@@ posing a tax .
in a cap@@ -and-@@ trade system , the government sets total allo@@ w@@ able national emissions of co2 per year and requires any firm that causes co2 emissions to have a per@@ mit per ton of co2 emitted .
if the government sells these per@@ mit@@ s in an au@@ ction , the price of the per@@ mit would be a cost to the firm in the same way as a carbon tax – and with the same resul@@ ting increases in consumer prices .
the cap@@ -and-@@ trade system thus im@@ poses a carbon tax without having to admit that it is really a tax .
a cap@@ -and-@@ trade system can cause serious risks to international trade .
even if every country has a cap@@ -and-@@ trade system and all aim at the same relative reduction in national co2 emissions , the resul@@ ting per@@ mit prices will differ because of national differences in initial co2 levels and in domestic production characteristics .
because the price of the co2 per@@ mit@@ s in a country is reflected in the prices of its products , the cap@@ -and-@@ trade system affects its international competi@@ tiveness .
when the per@@ mit prices become large enough to have a significant effect on co2 emissions , there will be political pressure to introduce tari@@ ffs on impor@@ ts that off@@ set the advantage of countries with low per@@ mit prices .
such off@@ setting tari@@ ffs would have to differ among products ( being higher on more co2-@@ intensive products ) and among countries ( being higher for countries with low per@@ mit prices ) .
such a system of complex differential tari@@ ffs is just the kind of prote@@ c@@ tion@@ ism that governments have been working to eliminate since the start of the g@@ att process more than 50 years ago .
worse still , cap@@ -and-@@ trade systems in practice do not rely sol@@ ely on au@@ ctions to distribute the emissions per@@ mit@@ s .
the plan working its way through the united states congress ( the wa@@ x@@ man-@@ marke@@ y bill ) would initially give away 85 % of the per@@ mit@@ s , impose a complex set of regul@@ atory policies , and allow companies to buy co2 off@@ sets ( e.@@ g. , by paying for the planting of trees ) instead of reducing their emissions or buying per@@ mit@@ s .
such complexi@@ ties make it impossible to compare the impact of co2 policies among countries , which in turn would invite those who want to protect domestic jobs to argue for higher tari@@ ff levels .
there is no easy answer to this problem .
but before rus@@ hing to impose tari@@ ffs , it is important to remember that cap@@ -and-@@ trade policies would not be the only government source of differences in competi@@ tiveness .
better roads , ports , and even schools all contribute to a country ’ s competi@@ tiveness .
no one attempts to use tari@@ ffs to balance those govern@@ ment-@@ created differences in competi@@ tiveness , and there should be no such attempts if a cap@@ -and-@@ trade system is introduced .
if an international agreement to impose a cap@@ -and-@@ trade scheme is adopted in copenhagen , the countries there should agree as well that there will be no attempt to introduce off@@ setting tari@@ ffs that would ultimately threaten our global system of free trade .
will china lead ?
new york – china ’ s willingness to join negotiations on potential san@@ ctions against iran and to send president hu j@@ inta@@ o to a nuclear security summit in washington this month are important pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary steps towards taking more responsibility in managing international affairs .
but merely joining conversations or showing up for meetings is not enough .
given its growing profile , china must do far more to demonstrate its bon@@ a fi@@ des as a responsible global leader or risk under@@ mining the system that has enabled its own miracul@@ ous rise .
china has emerged as a world power far more quickly than most obser@@ vers – and china ’ s own leaders – might have predicted as little as a decade ago .
china ’ s rapid economic growth , juxta@@ posed against america ’ s problems in iraq and afghanistan , monum@@ ental debt , and role in spar@@ king the global financial crisis , have changed global power realities – and global perceptions of those realities even more .
china ’ s current international influence likely out@@ strips its desire or capacity .
this puts china in a difficult position in relation to the so-called international system – the structures and rules created by the united states and others after the second world war to check national sovereig@@ n@@ ty through a system of over@@ la@@ pping jur@@ is@@ dic@@ tions , transnational obli@@ ga@@ tions , and fundamental rights .
china has been an enormous bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ ary of this system , and its rise would have been un@@ thin@@ kable without the us-@@ led free-@@ trade system and globalization process , access to us markets , and global shipping lanes secu@@ red by the us navy .
but china ’ s history of humili@@ ation at the hands of european coloni@@ al powers has made its leaders ar@@ dent suppor@@ ters of in@@ viol@@ able national rights and suspicious of any sacrifice of sovereig@@ n@@ ty .
because china ’ s leaders are not popul@@ arly elected , their legiti@@ macy ste@@ ms largely from two sources – their connection to the chinese revolution and their ability to deliver national security and economic growth .
although mao ze@@ d@@ ong is widely implic@@ ated in the unnecessary death of millions and is officially desig@@ nat@@ ed by the current regime as having been 30 % wrong , his photograph still ad@@ or@@ ns ti@@ an@@ an@@ men square , because the regime ’ s legiti@@ macy depends in part on its connection to the restor@@ ation of national sovereig@@ n@@ ty that mao represents .
the economic foundation of the chinese government ’ s legiti@@ macy also places an enormous burden on china ’ s leaders to make decisions that foster domestic economic growth at the expense of virtually everything else – including , some say , the vi@@ ability of the international currency regime , nuclear non-@@ proliferation , and basic rights in resour@@ ce-@@ rich countries .
this dich@@ ot@@ omy creates a difficult situation as china emerges as the world ’ s second largest economy .
if china , in the name of national sovereig@@ n@@ ty , does not buy into the international system , it becomes hard to argue that this system exists .
china ’ s un@@ willingness , for example , to join other members of the international community in pres@@ suring iran and north korea to abandon nuclear weapons programs fores@@ ha@@ dows the potential collapse of the nuclear non-@@ proliferation regime .
china ’ s active cour@@ ts@@ hip of countries that viol@@ ate human rights on a massive scale , such as sudan , north korea , and burma , similarly represents a pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary de@@ capit@@ ation of the international human rights regime .
given its size and importance , and regardless of its intentions , china will , perhaps in@@ adver@@ tently , destroy the international system if it does not either actively end@@ or@@ se and work to maintain it , or reframe it for the greater common good .
if it does neither , the world is in trouble .
if china sees itself as the hei@@ r and bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ ary of the us-@@ led post-@@ war international system , it must do much more to prevent and roll back nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , pay a much greater percentage of costs for the united nations , and cur@@ tail its mer@@ can@@ ti@@ list policies .
it must also end its alle@@ ged corrupt practices in resour@@ ce-@@ rich parts of the developing world , alig@@ n its currency policy with global norms , lead efforts to cur@@ b green@@ house@@ -@@ gas emissions , and , more generally , take into more account the fate of people outside of china in its decision-making .
if , on the other hand , as is its right , chinese leaders have an alternative vision of what an improved international system might look like , the on@@ us is on them to articulate that vision and out@@ line what they are willing to do to realize it .
there may be a better international model than the current one , but it will not emerge by default .
as us presidents franklin roosevelt and harry tru@@ man demonstrated in the 1940 ’ s , such a system must be artic@@ ulated and then for@@ ged through decisi@@ ve action and global leadership .
if china sees in@@ viol@@ able state sovereig@@ n@@ ty as the foundation of twenty-@@ first century international affairs , as now appears to be the case , then it must explain why this principle will not lead to the same disa@@ strous consequences as it did in the n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth and early twen@@ tieth centuries .
the us and the international community must acknowledge that today ’ s fast-@@ rising china has earned the right to play an important role in shaping how the twenty-@@ first century un@@ folds .
but if china ’ s leaders will neither do more to support the current international system , nor articulate an alternative , and instead continue to har@@ k back to n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ century models of in@@ viol@@ able sovereig@@ n@@ ty , they will destroy a global order that , war@@ ts and all , has served the world exce@@ ed@@ ingly well .
those countries that value the current system will increasingly feel the urge to close ran@@ ks to defend it .
will china “ lose ” the 2008 olympics ?
when the international olympic committee awar@@ ded beijing the 2008 summer games in july 2001 , the announcement ig@@ ni@@ ted wild celebra@@ tions across the country .
the chinese communist party hoped to use the games to show@@ case the country ’ s emergence as a dynamic , modern nation .
but as china ’ s leaders begin final prepar@@ ations for the games next august , they may be wondering if ho@@ sting the event was such a good idea after all .
they have significant reasons for doubt .
china ’ s senior leaders always closely monitor spontaneous public expressions of nation@@ alist fer@@ vor , fear@@ ful that shifting winds might blow an un@@ welcome storm in their direction .
of course what they hope is that the games will channel these energi@@ es toward national solidar@@ ity , which will allow the leadership to deliver its people a moment of achievement and patri@@ otic glory .
but the olympics will also bring intense international scru@@ tiny of china ’ s weak@@ nesses at a delicate moment in the country ’ s development .
the world already knows of china ’ s success and its attra@@ c@@ tiveness as a destination for foreign investment , but few outsi@@ ders have seen fir@@ sth@@ and the ste@@ ep price the country is paying for its new prosperity .
the most obvious signs of that cost flow through the country ’ s water@@ ways and contamin@@ ate its air .
run@@ away growth and development have left about 70 % of china ’ s lakes and rivers severely polluted , many un@@ fit for human use of any kind .
indeed , nearly a half-@@ billion chinese lack access to clean drinking water , and the number of termin@@ ally polluted rivers and lakes grows daily .
but air quality will prove the more embarrassing problem next august .
television coverage of athletes gas@@ ping for breath will hardly provide beijing with the signature olympic image it had in mind , and growing international anxiety over climate change and other environmental haz@@ ards will ensure that such issues receive consider@@ able media coverage .
there is also the risk that the games will become a political cir@@ cus , as the international spo@@ t@@ light generates ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble opportunities for public protest .
the chinese leadership has demonstrated many times that it can qu@@ ell domestic dis@@ sent , but the unique scale of the olympics will require ro@@ und-@@ the-@@ clock vi@@ gil@@ ance .
activists with gri@@ ev@@ ances over tibet , taiwan , burma , darfur , and dozens of other political , environmental , and human-@@ rights issues are already making plans .
is china ready for greenpeace , human rights in china , am@@ ne@@ sty international , and fal@@ un g@@ ong suppor@@ ters to take to the streets , with thousands of foreign journalists hungry for stories and asking questions that the authorities are un@@ ac@@ custom@@ ed to answering ?
even if police are able to maintain order in beijing , can they extend that control across the country ?
can they manage the flow of information and ideas through the blogo@@ sphere as online activists open yet another front in their battle for free information ?
what we do know that chinese officials have never faced a challenge of this scale with such a potential to both win and lose face .
the games will generate significant foreig@@ n-@@ policy risks as well .
in taiwan , out@@ going president chen shu@@ i-@@ bian is stir@@ ring the independence pot , knowing that the olympic spo@@ t@@ light will limit beijing ’ s ability to respond for@@ ce@@ fully .
he has already proposed a popular refer@@ end@@ um on tai@@ wan@@ ese mem@@ ber@@ ship in the united nations .
china ’ s influence within the un would prevent such a move even if taiwan voted yes , but an international confron@@ tation is the last thing china wants coinci@@ ding with the olympics .
then there is the matter of how the games will be received in the west .
since 2001 , china has increasingly become the focal point of much anxiety in the developed world .
huge bil@@ ateral trade defic@@ its , acc@@ us@@ ations that china keeps its currency under@@ valued , and a r@@ ash of defe@@ ctive and dangerous chines@@ e-@@ made exports have fu@@ eled a prote@@ c@@ tionist bac@@ klas@@ h in the united states and europe .
am@@ id bitter elec@@ tion-@@ year deb@@ ates over iraq and iran , and a sour@@ ing economic out@@ look , americans may be in no mood for the trium@@ p@@ hal@@ ist pa@@ ge@@ an@@ try of a new rising power on display in beijing .
will china ’ s un@@ easy asian neighbors be any more recep@@ tive ?
international criticism is sure to follow if something , anything , goes wrong during the games , especially if it involves the supp@@ ression of dis@@ sent and is vec@@ tor@@ ed around the world via 24-@@ hour cable television and the internet .
china has changed since it “ won ” the 2008 games seven years ago .
the party leadership has grown more self-@@ assu@@ red in its growing international role , but its ability to manage the pace of change at home has become more un@@ certain .
in 2001 , then president ji@@ ang z@@ em@@ in hoped the games would her@@ ald china ’ s arri@@ val as an industrialized power .
but his success@@ or , hu j@@ inta@@ o , has focused on the damage that has come from un@@ restra@@ ined growth .
he and premi@@ er wen ji@@ ab@@ ao have also champi@@ oned a more “ harmon@@ i@@ ous ” society , because they understand that the growing wealth gap , social ten@@ sions , environmental and public health problems , and the party ’ s ten@@ u@@ ous relationship with china ’ s less advanta@@ ged people can no longer be negle@@ cted .
how they look back on the games once the con@@ fett@@ i is swept from the streets is far from certain .
will china rule the world ?
cambridge – thir@@ ty years ago , china had a tiny footprint on the global economy and little influence outside its borders , save for a few countries with which it had close political and military relationships .
today , the country is a remarkable economic power : the world ’ s manufacturing workshop , its foremost finan@@ ci@@ er , a leading investor across the globe from africa to latin america , and , increasingly , a major source of research and development .
the chinese government sits at@@ op an astonishing level of foreign reserves – greater than $ 2 trillion .
there is not a single business anywhere in the world that has not felt china ’ s impact , either as a low-cost supp@@ lier , or more threat@@ en@@ ingly , as a for@@ mid@@ able competi@@ tor .
china is still a poor country .
although average incomes have ris@@ en very rapidly in recent decades , they still stand at between one-@@ seventh and one-@@ eighth the levels in the united states – lower than in turkey or colom@@ bia and not much higher than in el sal@@ v@@ ad@@ or or egypt .
while coastal china and its major metropoli@@ ses ev@@ in@@ ce tremendous wealth , large swa@@ ths of western china remain mi@@ red in poverty .
meanwhile , the us , the world ’ s sole economic hyper-@@ power until recently , remains a dimin@@ ished giant . it stands hum@@ bled by its foreig@@ n-@@ policy bl@@ unders and a massive financial crisis .
its credi@@ bility after the disa@@ strous invasion of iraq is at an all-@@ time low , not@@ with@@ standing the global sympathy for president barack obama , and its economic model is in tat@@ ters .
the on@@ ce-@@ al@@ mighty dollar tot@@ ters at the mer@@ cy of china and the o@@ il-@@ rich states .
all of which raises the question of whether china will eventually replace the us as the world ’ s he@@ gem@@ on , the global economy ’ s rule se@@ tter and en@@ for@@ cer .
in a fascinating new book , reve@@ al@@ ingly titled when china rules the world , the british scholar and journalist martin jacques is un@@ equi@@ vocal : if you think china will be integrated smo@@ oth@@ ly into a liberal , capit@@ alist , and democratic world system , jacques argues , you are in for a big surprise .
not only is china the next economic superpower , but the world order that it will construct will look very different from what we have had under american leadership .
americans and europeans bli@@ th@@ ely assume that china will become more like them as its economy develops and its population gets richer .
this is a mira@@ ge , jacques says .
the chinese and their government are we@@ d@@ ded to a different conception of society and poli@@ ty : commun@@ ity-@@ based rather than individu@@ alist , state-@@ centric rather than liberal , authoritarian rather than democratic .
china has 2,000 years of history as a distinct civilization from which to draw strength .
it will not simply fold under western values and institutions .
a world order centered on china will reflect chinese values rather than western ones , jacques argues .
beijing will over@@ shadow new york , the ren@@ min@@ bi will replace the dollar , mandarin will take over from english , and school@@ children around the world will learn about z@@ hen@@ g he ’ s voy@@ ages of discovery along the eastern coast of africa rather than about vas@@ co de g@@ ama or christopher colum@@ bus .
gone will be the evange@@ li@@ sm of markets and democracy .
china is much less likely to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereig@@ n states .
but , in return , it will demand that smaller , less powerful states explicitly recognize china ’ s pri@@ macy ( just as in the tribu@@ tary systems of old ) .
before any of this comes to pass , however , china will have to continue its rapid economic growth and maintain its social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on and political unity . none of this is guaranteed .
beneath china ’ s powerful economic dynam@@ o lie deep ten@@ sions , ine@@ qualities , and c@@ lea@@ v@@ ages that could well der@@ a@@ il a smooth progression to global he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y .
throughout its long history , centri@@ fu@@ gal forces have often pushed the country into dis@@ array and dis@@ integration .
china ’ s stability hing@@ es critically on its government ’ s ability to deliver steady economic gains to the vast majority of the population .
china is the only country in the world where anything less than 8 % growth year after year is believed to be dangerous because it would unle@@ ash social un@@ rest .
most of the rest of the world only dreams about growth at that rate , which speaks volumes about the underlying fragi@@ lity of the chinese system .
the authoritarian nature of the political regime is at the core of this fragi@@ lity .
it allows only repres@@ sion when the government faces prote@@ sts and opposition outside the established channels .
the trouble is that it will become increasingly difficult for china to maintain the kind of growth that it has experienced in recent years . china ’ s growth currently reli@@ es on an under@@ valued currency and a huge trade surplus .
this is unsustainable , and sooner or later it will precipit@@ ate a major confron@@ tation with the us ( and europe ) .
there are no easy ways out of this dilemma .
china will likely have to settle for lower growth .
if china sur@@ moun@@ ts these hur@@ d@@ les and does eventually become the world ’ s pre@@ dominant economic power , globalization will , indeed , take on chinese characteristics .
democracy and human rights will then likely lose their lu@@ ster as global norms .
that is the bad news .
the good news is that a chinese global order will display greater respect for national sovereig@@ n@@ ty and more tolerance for national diversity .
there will be greater room for experimentation with different economic models .
will china ’ s capit@@ alist revolution turn democratic
communist china has experienced a monum@@ ental capit@@ alist revolution in the last two decades , with an economy that is now six times bigger than it was 20 years ago .
a minor player in the global economy in the 1980 ’ s , china today is the world ’ s third largest trading power .
but if these stunning economic statistics make you think that so much capit@@ alist development must also have brought more democracy to china , think again .
most westerners believe in a theory of liberal evolution , according to which sustained economic growth , by increasing wealth and the size of the middle class , gradually makes a country more democratic .
while the long-@@ run record of this theory is ir@@ refu@@ table , china ’ s authoritarian rul@@ ing elite is not only determined to hold on to power , but it also has been smart enough to take adaptive measures aimed at counter@@ ing the liber@@ alizing effects of economic development .
thus , for all its a@@ we@@ -@@ inspiring economic achievement , china has made remarkably little progress in political liber@@ alization .
indeed , jud@@ ging by several key indi@@ cators , progress toward democracy in china has st@@ alled , despite unprecedented economic prosperity and personal freedom .
for instance , in the mid-@@ 1980 ’ s , chinese leaders seriously discussed and later drew up a blueprint for modest democratic reforms .
today , the topic of political reform is taboo .
nearly all the major institutional reforms , such as streng@@ th@@ ening the legis@@ l@@ ature , holding village elections , and building a modern legal system , were launched in the 1980 ’ s .
since the ti@@ an@@ an@@ men square mas@@ sac@@ re of june 1989 , however , not a single major democratic reform initiative has been implemented .
instead of democratic transition , china has witnessed a con@@ soli@@ dation of authoritarian rule – the streng@@ th@@ ening of a one-@@ party regime through organi@@ zational learning and adaptation .
since 1989 , the chinese communist party ( c@@ cp ) has been pursuing a two-@@ pron@@ ged strategy : selective repres@@ sion that targets organized political opposition and co-@@ op@@ tation of new social elites ( the intelligent@@ sia , professionals , and private entrepreneurs ) .
this strategy emphasi@@ zes the maintenance of an extensive law en@@ for@@ cement apparatus designed to eliminate any inci@@ pi@@ ent organized opposition .
huge investments have streng@@ th@@ ened the people ’ s armed police ( pa@@ p ) , a large anti-@@ ri@@ ot param@@ ili@@ tary force whose speci@@ alty is the quick supp@@ ression of anti-@@ government prote@@ sts by dis@@ grun@@ tled industrial workers , pe@@ as@@ ants , and urban residents .
frequent deplo@@ yment of the pa@@ p is a major reason why the tens of thousands of collective prote@@ sts that occur each year ( 7@@ 4,000 in 2004 and 8@@ 6,000 in 2005 ) have had a ne@@ gli@@ gible impact on china ’ s overall stability .
to deal with new emerging political threats , such as the information revolution , the chinese government has spent mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ ly on man@@ power and technology .
a special 30@@ ,000-@@ strong police unit monit@@ ors and screens internet traffic , advanced technology is deployed to block access to overseas web sites considered “ hostile or harmful , ” and internet service and content providers , both domestic and western , must comp@@ ly with on@@ er@@ ous restri@@ ctions designed to suppress political dis@@ sent and track down offen@@ ders .
the regime has even conducted multi-@@ agency exercis@@ es to test whether different government bodies could cooperate closely to keep “ harmful information ” off the net during an emergency .
having learned from the collapse of the soviet union that a bureau@@ cratic rul@@ ing party must co-@@ op@@ t new social elites to depri@@ ve potential opposition groups of leaders , the communist party has conducted an effective campaign of expanding its social base .
the urban intelligent@@ sia and professionals have been pam@@ per@@ ed with material per@@ ks and political recognition , while new private entrepreneurs have been allowed to join the party .
this strategy of pre-@@ emp@@ tive political de@@ capit@@ ation has produced enormous divi@@ den@@ ds for the party .
in the 1980 ’ s , its principal adver@@ sar@@ ies were the urban intelligent@@ sia , who constitu@@ ted the back@@ bone of the pro-@@ democracy movement that cul@@ min@@ ated in ti@@ an@@ an@@ men square .
today , the mainstream of the chinese intelligent@@ sia is an integra@@ l part of the rul@@ ing elite .
many have joined the party and become government officials , and a large percentage enjoy various professional and financial privile@@ ges .
predic@@ tably , the intelligent@@ sia , usually the most liberal social group , is no longer a lethal threat to party rule .
worse , without support from this strategic group , other social groups , such as workers and pe@@ as@@ ants , have become politically margin@@ alized and ru@@ d@@ der@@ less .
although the party ’ s car@@ ro@@ t-@@ and-@@ stick approach has worked since 1989 , it is doub@@ t@@ ful that it will retain its efficacy for another 17 years .
to the extent that china ’ s authoritarian regime is by nature exclu@@ sion@@ ary ( it can only incorporate a limited number of elites ) , the co-@@ op@@ tation strategy will soon run up against its limits , and the party will no longer have the resources to buy off the intelligent@@ sia or keep private entrepreneurs happy .
at the same time , selective repres@@ sion can contain social fru@@ strations and dis@@ content only tempor@@ arily .
as long as much of chinese society views the current political system as un@@ just , un@@ responsive , and corrupt , there will always be a large reservo@@ ir of ill will toward the rul@@ ing elites .
when things go wrong – as is likely , given moun@@ ting social strains caused by rising inequality , environmental degradation , and de@@ terior@@ ating public services – china ’ s ali@@ en@@ ated masses could become politically radi@@ c@@ alized .
and , unlike past prote@@ sts , which have usually been al@@ lied with students or members of the intelligent@@ sia , popular dis@@ affe@@ ction might not have the virtue of rational leaders with whom the government could talk and negotiate .
so it may be premature for the party to celebrate the success of its adaptive strategy .
china ’ s rul@@ ers may have st@@ alled democratic trends for now , but the current strategy has , perhaps , merely del@@ a@@ yed the inevitable .
will china stand up in north korea ?
on october 1 , 1949 , as chi@@ ang ka@@ i-@@ che@@ k &apos;s defeated ku@@ omin@@ tan@@ g ( k@@ mt ) troops fl@@ ed for taiwan , mao ze@@ d@@ ong declared that &quot; china has stood up . &quot;
china has , indeed , stood up , and continues to rise as one of the world &apos;s largest economies .
last year , china alone accoun@@ ted for roughly 60 % of global export growth .
nowhere does this seem tru@@ er than in china &apos;s own backyard .
beijing &apos;s seem@@ ing silence over the nuclear ambi@@ tions of north korea has left us , japanese , and south korean officials alike wondering when it will &quot; stand up &quot; to ass@@ ert its influence over its neighbor and erst@@ while ally .
one reason china seems paralyzed in the current crisis is that , among the world &apos;s major powers , it is almost alone in having a genuine &quot; two kore@@ as &quot; policy .
since china established diplo@@ matic relations with south korea in the early l@@ 9@@ 90 &apos;s , economic ties have grown dramatically , and cultural relations have expanded at a comparable pace .
china also recipro@@ cated out@@ going president kim da@@ e-@@ jung &apos;s over@@ tures in the poli@@ tic@@ al-@@ security realm , despite south korea &apos;s strategic ties with the us .
but in recognizing south korea , china took greater care than , say , russia , in seeking to am@@ eli@@ or@@ ate north korea &apos;s anx@@ ie@@ ties .
china is north korea &apos;s most important trading partner , with tur@@ no@@ ver exce@@ eding $ 700 million in 2002 , up 30 % from 2001 .
indeed , china is believed to supply about 70 % of the north &apos;s oil , and has doubled its sales of grain and vegetables .
while china no longer promises the north military support ( except in the event of external attack ) , &quot; consul@@ tations &quot; are ple@@ dged .
priv@@ ately , china &apos;s leaders are du@@ bi@@ ous ( at best ) about north korea .
they think that economic reform is long over@@ due , and , like others , consider kim jon@@ g-@@ il &apos;s political system bizarre .
for their part , north korea &apos;s elite understands that they have no true allies at present , not even in beijing .
yet kim jon@@ g-@@ il &apos;s two trips to china illustrate his interest in china &apos;s reforms and his desire to cultivate china &apos;s support .
how much the chinese know about the inner work@@ ings of north korea &apos;s policy@@ -@@ making and power structure , and how much influence they can have , are un@@ certain .
china claims that its power over py@@ on@@ gy@@ ang is limited .
what china wants above all is to prevent north korea from collap@@ sing , whatever the cause .
conflict on the korean pen@@ insu@@ la , nour@@ ished by the vi@@ tri@@ oli@@ c language often employed by kim jon@@ g-@@ il &apos;s regime , is china &apos;s nightmare .
war between the kore@@ as would confront beijing with a flood of hundreds of thousands of refugees .
equally important , china is war@@ y of the prospect of korea being unified under south korean rule and backed up by continued strategic support from the us .
fortunately , north korea &apos;s leaders prefer survival to suicide .
they know that despite the extensive damage that they could in@@ fli@@ ct on the south , in the end , they would be destroyed by american and south korean power if combat ever starts .
hence , war initi@@ ated by the north , while not un@@ thin@@ kable , seems unlikely .
a third possibility is an in@@ defini@@ te continu@@ ation of the status quo .
this , too , seems doub@@ t@@ ful .
north korea is a failing state economically , a fact that kim jon@@ g-@@ il and his cr@@ onies appear to recognize .
since the mid-@@ l@@ 9@@ 90 &apos;s , they have been explor@@ ing-@@ -@@ alb@@ eit cau@@ ti@@ ously and un@@ certain@@ ly-@@ -@@ aven@@ ues of change , including fla@@ wed price liber@@ alization many prices in mid-@@ 2002 .
whatever the event@@ ual outcome , the status quo is un@@ ten@@ able .
a fourth alternative , favor@@ ed by china and other key players , is an evolutionary process that combin@@ es economic reform with increased interaction with the external world , focusing initially on south korea .
china will move carefully but firmly in promoting this path .
it is anxious to see a us-@@ north korea dialogue begin , one capable of alle@@ vi@@ ating the north &apos;s anx@@ ie@@ ties about an american attack and america &apos;s concerns about a rene@@ wed nuclear program .
indeed , the main factor fu@@ eling the current crisis and complic@@ ating its resolution is that the north has only one bar@@ gaining chip : threats .
aside from a ple@@ dge of non-@@ aggression , its central interest is in ob@@ taining economic assistance .
yet the us and others are war@@ y of being labeled appe@@ as@@ ers .
well aware of the complexi@@ ties and ha@@ zar@@ d@@ s-@@ -@@ and seeking to avoid ali@@ en@@ ating any of the parti@@ es-@@ -@@ china is willing to play the role of conven@@ er , but not adju@@ dic@@ ator , of an americ@@ an-@@ north korean dialogue .
thus , its pro@@ cla@@ imed &quot; disagreement &quot; with north korea &apos;s with@@ dra@@ wal from the non-@@ proliferation treaty was relatively mild .
nonetheless , china &apos;s stake in the outcome of the current crisis is big enough to make it a party to a wide range of ex@@ changes , formal and informal , bil@@ ateral and multi@@ lat@@ er@@ al-@@ -@@ all with the objective of promoting change without up@@ hea@@ val on the korean pen@@ insu@@ la .
in this respect , the us and china have common interests , as do japan , russia , and south korea .
china , too , believes that if advoc@@ ates of &quot; regime change &quot; do not push north korea too hard , a strategy can be pursu@@ ed that is based on slow evolution rather than a precipit@@ ous break@@ -@@ -@@ and a possible violent breakdown .
could china turn in@@ ward ?
shanghai – on the face of it , china and the united states both look as though they would be relatively insul@@ ated if trade ten@@ sions continue to escal@@ ate .
china ’ s exports to the us account for only 4 % of its gdp , and its impor@@ ts from the us amount to just 1 % of gdp .
in the us , with its large , domest@@ ically driven economy , the equivalent figures are 1 % and 3 % .
but putting aside these headline numbers , a retreat from globalization by the world ’ s two largest economies would nonetheless ent@@ a@@ il significant costs .
true , china has been re@@ balancing away from exports : domestic consumption contributed to more than 60 % of its gdp growth in ten of the 15 quarters since 2015 , and up to 80 % in the first half of 20@@ 18 .
in many consumer categories , china is now the world ’ s largest market .
and it also now accounts for 30 % of global auto sales ( and 43 % of unit sales of electric vehicles ) and 42 % of global retail e-@@ commerce trans@@ action value .
moreover , the mck@@ inse@@ y global institute finds that while the world ’ s exposure to china in terms of trade , technology , and capital increased from 2000 to 20@@ 17 , china ’ s exposure to the world pe@@ aked in 2007 , and has declined ever since .
as recently as 2008 , china ’ s net trade surplus accoun@@ ted for 8 % of its gdp ; by 20@@ 17 , it had fallen to 1.@@ 7 % .
that is less than either germany or south korea , where net exports generate 5-@@ 8 % of gdp .
following a sustained period in which china drove global growth , it seems as though its great “ opening up ” is losing momentum .
after china joined the world trade organization in 2001 , it cut tari@@ ffs by half , bringing them down to 8 % as of 2008 .
yet , by 20@@ 16 , they had ed@@ ged back up to 9.@@ 6 % – a rate that is more than double the us and eu average .
at the same time , china ’ s barriers to foreign capital in@@ flows to services remain high .
and the government appears to promote the growth of local companies , not least through its “ made in china 20@@ 25 ” plan , which sets guidelines for domestic companies in 11 of 23 high-@@ priority sub@@ sectors .
still , these trends do not necessarily mean that china is closing itself off from the world .
in fact , there are five reasons why an increasingly au@@ t@@ arch@@ ic china is unlikely .
for star@@ ters , china remains dependent on foreign technology , with half of its technology impor@@ ts coming from just three countries – the us ( 27 % ) , japan ( 17 % ) , and germany ( 11 % ) – between 2011 and 20@@ 16 .
more to the point , these numbers have barely bud@@ ged over the past 20 years , despite china ’ s efforts to boost innovation at home .
second , were china to close itself off , it would damage its neighbors ’ economic pro@@ spe@@ cts , thus dest@@ abili@@ zing its own immediate region .
for example , according to a recent oecd analysis , malaysia , singapore , and south korea could lose 0.@@ 5-@@ 1.5 % of gdp each as a result of reduced us-@@ china trade .
this , in turn , would set back china ’ s ambi@@ tions to be the region ’ s trade an@@ chor .
third , with a turn in@@ ward , china would start to miss out on investment and know-how from the multination@@ als currently operating in its economy .
as of 2015 , there were 4@@ 8@@ 1,000 foreign enter@@ pris@@ es in china ( more than twice as many as in 2000 ) , emplo@@ ying around 14 million workers .
about 40 % of china ’ s exports are produced by foreign companies , or by foreig@@ n-@@ domestic joint vent@@ ures .
moreover , foreign firms produce 87 % of electronics in china , and 59 % of machinery .
not by coincidence , those are the sectors most affected by the current trade dispute .
a survey conducted by the american chamber of commerce in china rein@@ forces concerns about the impact of escal@@ ating trade ten@@ sions on foreign investment .
already , 31 % of us firms say they may delay or can@@ cel investment decisions , 18 % may reloc@@ ate some or all of their manufacturing outside china , and 3 % may even exit the chinese market altogether .
fourth , a reduction in trade could sa@@ p the reform momentum china needs to iron out the many in@@ effici@@ encies in its domestic economy .
for example , china ’ s efforts to position its financial system to manage the risks associated with high debt levels will be si@@ del@@ ined if it is forced to provide more liqui@@ dity to the economy to make up for trade losses .
likewise , china ’ s inefficient state-@@ owned enter@@ pris@@ es – whose return on assets is only 30-@@ 50 % that of privat@@ e-@@ sector companies – need to be over@@ hau@@ led as part of a broader agenda to boost productivity .
but if the economy comes under pressure , those efforts , too , could be del@@ a@@ yed for fear of under@@ mining employment .
finally , and more broadly , there is am@@ ple evidence showing that global inter@@ connectedness is good for growth .
m@@ gi finds that global flows of goods , services , capital , people , and data over the past decade have boo@@ sted world gdp by around 10 % above where it otherwise would have been .
a rever@@ sal of china ’ s great opening up would hurt not just china , but everyone – including the us .
losing access to chinese markets , capital flows , exports , and talent would result in higher prices and slower growth , whereas the benefits of reduced levels of competition to us industries are less clear .
chinese impor@@ ts have cut the price of us consumer goods by an estimated 27 % .
and firms in the us would take a direct hit from higher tari@@ ffs in trade , given that 77 % of china ’ s exports to the us are inter@@ medi@@ ary and capital goods used to produce finished products , according to the mck@@ inse@@ y global trade database .
turning in@@ ward may be temp@@ ting for china , but the economic costs of doing so would be significant .
one hopes – perhaps against hope – that the 9@@ 0-@@ day tru@@ ce on tari@@ ff increases lasts , so that an enduring trade agreement can be for@@ ged .
will london survive bre@@ x@@ it ?
london – bre@@ x@@ it has set a hungry cat among the financial pige@@ ons of the city of london .
no one yet knows what kind of access to the european union ’ s single financial market u@@ k-@@ based firms will have , and prime minister ther@@ esa may ’ s call for a general election to be held on june 8 has further clou@@ ded the picture , at least in the short term .
but there is a na@@ gging assumption that things cannot remain the same , and that there will be a price to be paid for leaving the eu .
so u@@ k-@@ based financial services firms , especially those that have chosen london as their european headquarters precisely in order to secure access to the whole eu market from one location , are re@@ viewing their options .
indeed , regul@@ ators are obli@@ ging them to do so , by asking how they will maintain continuity of service to their clients in the event of a “ hard ” bre@@ x@@ it .
( may ’ s government pre@@ fers to talk of a “ clean ” bre@@ x@@ it , but that is seman@@ tics ) .
ri@@ val european centers have spo@@ tted an opportunity to cla@@ w some of this business back to the continent ( or to ireland ) .
other governments have long res@@ ented london ’ s dominance .
it was gall@@ ing to have to acknowledge that the principal center for trading in euro@@ -@@ denomin@@ ated instruments lay outside the euro@@ zone .
just a few years ago , the european central bank tried to insist that the clear@@ ing of euro instruments should take place within its jur@@ is@@ di@@ ction , but was prevented from doing so by a rul@@ ing from the european court of justice .
that is somewhat ironic : removing the uk from the ec@@ j ’ s jur@@ is@@ di@@ ction is now one of may ’ s principal aims .
so dele@@ gation after dele@@ gation of ministers , may@@ ors , and as@@ sor@@ ted financial center lobby@@ ists have been filling london ’ s best hotels and providing a welcome boost to the high-@@ end restaurant trade .
lux@@ em@@ bour@@ g , frank@@ fur@@ t , du@@ bli@@ n , and others have been making glo@@ ss@@ y presentations about their cities ’ competitive advantages over london : lower property costs , lower corporate tax rates ( that sounds plau@@ sible when cla@@ imed with an ir@@ ish accent ) , michel@@ in-@@ star@@ red restaurants , and por@@ sche de@@ al@@ er@@ ships – all the essential services that make up a vibrant financial center .
some of these presentations have raised a w@@ ry smile or two .
french president fran@@ ç@@ ois holl@@ an@@ de was elected on a claim that the world of high finance was his enemy .
yet the president of the paris region recently promised a “ red , white , and blue carpet ” for any he@@ dge fund manager who buys a one-@@ way euro@@ star ticket to the g@@ are du nord – a bar@@ bed reference to former uk prime minister david cameron ’ s promise of a red carpet for french bankers fle@@ eing prohi@@ bi@@ tive tax rates , strikes , and restri@@ ctive labor laws .
suddenly , everyone loves those masters of the universe who nearly destroyed the world ’ s financial system in 2008 .
all this pro@@ mo@@ tional activity has raised ane@@ w the question of just what combination of characteristics a successful financial center must have .
the question has been asked many times , and management consul@@ tan@@ cies have earned good money offering their patent answers .
a pre-@@ crisis study by mck@@ inse@@ y for former new york city mayor michael blo@@ om@@ berg recommen@@ ded copying london ’ s regul@@ atory system , which blew up soon there@@ after .
hong kong officials ’ review of their own regulations , carried out to identify ways to boost the city ’ s attra@@ c@@ tiveness to international firms , found that what firms really wanted was cleaner air and more international schools .
neither is within the jur@@ is@@ di@@ ction of the mon@@ etary authority ( or even , in the case of air pollution , of the hong kong government ) .
many of the surveys asking firms why they choose a particular location produce essentially circular answers . they say they are there because other firms are , and they can therefore conduct business easily with their principal counter@@ parties .
there are , however , a few consistent themes .
foreign firms like to think that they are treated no differently from domestic competitors .
so politically driven regulation is a tur@@ n-@@ off .
they also want an independent court system that uph@@ olds property rights .
and they want access to skilled staff .
on these measures , london and new york continue to do well .
the latest global financial cent@@ res index , published last month by z / yen , shows that london remains at the top of the league , margin@@ ally ahead of new york .
but the ratings of both have declined shar@@ ply over the last year , and the gap between them and third-@@ place singapore , more than 30 points last year , is only 20 this year .
indeed , almost all of the asian centers have lifted their ratings , with beijing rising the fastest , moving from 2@@ 6@@ th to 16@@ th place .
if we look specifically at europe , the only other financial center in the global top 20 is lux@@ em@@ bour@@ g , which cre@@ eps in at 18 , six places lower than last year .
frank@@ fur@@ t , at 23 , fell four places this year , and paris has been stuck at 29 for the last couple of surveys .
so london has a huge lead in europe .
will bre@@ x@@ it be enough to alter that picture fundamentally ?
it remains hard to say .
on the key factors for firms , london ’ s national@@ ity-@@ blind regul@@ atory system is not likely to change ; nor is the court system .
so those advantages should be sustained .
the key swing factor is likely to be the availability of skilled staff .
lon@@ d@@ on-@@ based financial firms are ac@@ custom@@ ed to being able to recruit from across the eu ; indeed , the british authorities have been flexible on non-@@ eu staff , too .
because most as@@ pir@@ ing finance professionals in europe can speak good english , firms have had a deep pool in which to fish .
whether that pool survi@@ ves bre@@ x@@ it will turn out to be the biggest political question for the city of london in the coming negotiations .
the next uk prime minister , who just might be may , will need to produce a good answer , or london will not remain at the top of the league for much longer .
the mira@@ ge of the financial singularity
new haven – in their new book the incredible shrinking alpha , larry e. swe@@ dro@@ e and andrew l@@ . berk@@ in describe an investment environment populated by increasingly sophisticated analy@@ sts who rely on big data , powerful computers , and schol@@ arly research .
with all this competition , “ the hur@@ d@@ les to achieving alpha &#91; returns above a ris@@ k-@@ adju@@ sted bench@@ mark – and thus a measure of success in picking individual investments &#93; are getting higher and higher . ”
that conclusion raises a key question : will alpha eventually go to zero for every imagin@@ able investment strategy ?
more fundamentally , is the day approaching when , thanks to so many smart people and smarter computers , financial markets really do become perfect , and we can just sit back , relax , and assume that all assets are pri@@ ced correctly ?
this imagined state of affairs might be called the financial singularity , analog@@ ous to the hypothetical future technological singularity , when computers replace human intelligence .
the financial singularity impli@@ es that all investment decisions would be better left to a computer program , because the experts with their algorithms have figured out what drives market outcomes and reduced it to a seam@@ less system .
many believe that we are almost there .
even legendary investors like warren buff@@ ett , it is argued , are not really out@@ performing the market .
in a recent paper , “ buff@@ ett ’ s alpha , ” andre@@ a fra@@ z@@ zin@@ i and david kab@@ il@@ ler of a@@ q@@ r capital management and lasse pe@@ der@@ sen of copenhagen business school , conclude that buff@@ ett is not generating significantly positive alpha if one takes account of certain less@@ er-@@ known risk factors that have weighed heavily in his portfolio .
the implication is that buffet ’ s genius could be replic@@ ated by a computer program that incorpor@@ ates these factors .
if that were true , investors would abandon , en masse , their efforts to fer@@ ret out mis@@ pricing in the market , because there wouldn ’ t be any . market participants would ration@@ ally assume that every stock price is the true expected present value of future cash flows , with the appropriate rate of dis@@ count , and that those cash flows reflect fundament@@ als that everyone understands the same way .
indeed , according to a computer crun@@ ching big data , this would be an optimal decision .
there is a long-@@ recognized problem with such perfect markets : no one would want to exp@@ end any effort to figure out what osc@@ il@@ lations in prices mean for the future .
thir@@ ty-@@ five years ago , in their classic paper , “ on the im@@ possibility of information@@ ally efficient markets , ” san@@ ford gross@@ man and joseph stig@@ li@@ tz presented this problem as a paradox : perfectly efficient markets require the effort of smart money to make them so ; but if markets were perfect , smart money would give up trying .
the gross@@ man-@@ stig@@ li@@ tz con@@ un@@ drum seems less compelling in the financial singularity if we can imagine that computers direct all the investment decisions .
although alpha may be van@@ ish@@ ingly small , it still represents enough profit to keep the computers running .
but the real problem with this vision of financial singularity is not the gross@@ man-@@ stig@@ li@@ tz con@@ un@@ drum ; it is that real-world markets are nowhere close to it .
computer enthusi@@ a@@ sts are excited by things like the block@@ chain used by bit@@ coin ( covered on an education website called singularity university , in a section dramatically titled exponential finance ) .
but the futuri@@ sts ’ financial world bears no resem@@ blan@@ ce to today ’ s financial world .
after all , the financial singularity impli@@ es that all prices would be based on such things as opti@@ m@@ ally projected future corporate profits and the correlation of profits with expected technological innovations and long-term demographic changes .
but the smart money hardly ever talks in such e@@ there@@ al terms .
in this context , it is difficult not to think of china ’ s recent stock@@ -@@ market pl@@ unge .
news accounts depic@@ t hor@@ des of emotional people trading on hun@@ ch and super@@ sti@@ tion .
that looks a lot more like reality than all the talk of im@@ pen@@ ding financial singularity .
markets seem to be driven by stories , as i emphasize in my book irrational exu@@ ber@@ ance .
there are stories of great new er@@ as and of lo@@ oming depres@@ sions .
there are fundamental stories about technology and declining resources . and there are stories about politics and bizarre conspi@@ ra@@ cies .
no one knows if these stories are true , but they take on a life of their own .
when one has a hear@@ t-@@ to-@@ heart talk with many seemingly rational people , they turn out to have crazy theories .
these people influence markets , because all other investors must reck@@ on with them ; and their cra@@ z@@ iness is not going away anytime soon .
maybe buff@@ ett ’ s past investing style can be captured in a trading algorithm today .
but that does not necessarily de@@ tra@@ ct from his genius .
indeed , the true source of his success may con@@ s@@ ist in his understanding of when to abandon one method and dev@@ ise another .
the idea of financial singularity may seem inspiring ; but it is no less ill@@ us@@ ory than the rational utopia that inspired generations of central planners .
human judgment , good and bad , will drive investment decisions and finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ market outcomes for the rest of our lives and beyond .
are emerging markets the canary in the financial coal mine ?
bu@@ en@@ os aires – are bre@@ wing ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate and debt crises in argentina and turkey loc@@ alized events without broader implications ?
or are they early warning signs of deeper fragi@@ li@@ ties in blo@@ ated global debt markets that are being exposed as the us federal reserve continues to norm@@ alize interest rates ?
rising interest rates could test stability in some advanced economies as well , especially in italy , where voters , particularly in the less developed south , have op@@ ted decisi@@ vely for a disruptive popu@@ list government .
with an economy ten times the size of greece , a default in italy would blow up the euro@@ zone .
indeed , the popu@@ list coalition government that has now taken power has hin@@ ted that it wants wri@@ te-@@ offs for some of its under-@@ the-@@ table deb@@ ts ( not included in italy ’ s official public debt of over 130 % of gdp ) to the euro system through the european central bank .
the good news is that a full-@@ blown global debt crisis is still relatively unlikely to er@@ u@@ pt .
even with a recent so@@ f@@ ten@@ ing of european performance , the overall global economic picture remains strong , with most regions of the world still growing br@@ is@@ k@@ ly .
although it is true that several emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market firms have pil@@ ed up wor@@ ris@@ ome quantities of dollar-@@ denomin@@ ated external debt , many foreign central banks are bri@@ mming with dollar assets , especially in asia .
the international mon@@ etary fund , moreover , has sufficient resources to handle a first wave of crises , even if it includes , say , brazil .
the main concern is not that the imf will fail to deliver funds , but that it will make the same mistake it did in greece , by not im@@ posing a realistic deal on deb@@ tors and credi@@ tors .
as for italy , chances are that europe will find a way to grant tempor@@ arily some of the extra budget sl@@ ack the new government see@@ ks , even if there is no way euro@@ zone officials can allow high-@@ debt italy simply to destroy the common currency .
the most important reason for optimism , not@@ with@@ standing all the surrounding political noise , is that global long-term real interest rates are still extremely low .
even with all the drama surrounding fed ti@@ ghten@@ ing , 30-@@ year infla@@ tion-@@ inde@@ x@@ ed treas@@ ury bills are paying around 1 % – far below long-term real returns , which have aver@@ aged closer to 3 % .
as long as the underlying global interest@@ -@@ rate picture is so benign , it is hard to see the big ka@@ hun@@ a of bon@@ d-@@ default waves coming just yet .
it is not@@ able how much the imf , the world ’ s debt and financial crisis wat@@ ch@@ dog , has been rat@@ ch@@ eting up its warn@@ ings .
after years of saying advanced countries no longer need to worry about their near-@@ record publi@@ c-@@ debt levels – now aver@@ aging over 100 % for general government debt – the imf has started to warn that many countries may find themselves squee@@ zed for fiscal space if faced with a new recession anytime soon .
the challenges stem not only from debt that is on the books , but also from hidden li@@ abilities , o@@ wing most not@@ ably to massively under@@ funded old-@@ age pension and heal@@ th-@@ care programs – implic@@ it deb@@ ts that in many cases are far larger than the official figures .
the overwhelming evidence of recent research supports the imf view .
countries with historically high debt levels have ( on average ) significantly poorer growth performance in the face of major sho@@ cks , and the long-term relation between high public debt and growth is distin@@ ctly negative .
this , of course , says absolutely nothing about the economic consequences of actively reducing the burden of government debt , popul@@ arly known as “ au@@ ster@@ ity . ”
deep rec@@ essions are the time to use a country ’ s war chest , not the time to build it up .
admit@@ tedly , there are those on both the left and the right who think “ this time is different ” for advanced economies .
with no realistic danger ( in their view ) of a major war or financial crisis anytime soon , it is fol@@ ly to exercise too much restra@@ int on public debt or pension promises .
this is dangerous thinking even for the united states , despite the greater fiscal scope it enjo@@ ys as the issu@@ er of the global reserve currency .
very bad sho@@ cks can happen to any economy , and their sources might not be the ones we normally consider .
for example , risks ste@@ mming from cyber@@ attacks ( especially by state actors ) , pande@@ mics , and certainly financial crises are probably far higher than anyone would like to admit .
it is certainly not difficult to imagine a temporary slow@@ down in fast-@@ growing china that could ro@@ il world markets .
and if the completely unexpected does happen , one thing we can anticipate is that governments with strong access to global credit markets will have much better options for responding .
even if the best bet is that any emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market bond mel@@ t@@ down would remain contained , today ’ s j@@ it@@ ters ought to be a wa@@ ke@@ -up call , even for advanced economies .
after all , no country , however rich , should bet its future on the prospect that today ’ s ultra-@@ benign interest@@ -@@ rate environment will last forever .
economists who assure us that advan@@ ce@@ d-@@ economy debt is completely “ safe ” sound e@@ eri@@ ly like those who tou@@ ted the “ great moder@@ ation ” – the supposedly permanent reduction in cycli@@ cal vola@@ tili@@ ty – a generation ago .
in many cases , they are the same people .
but , as we saw a decade ago , and will inevitably see again , we are not at the “ end of history ” when it comes to global debt and financial crises .
will europe be willing but disabled ?
new@@ port beach – when it comes to describing europe ’ s ever-@@ wor@@ sen@@ ing crisis , metaphors abo@@ und .
for some , it is five minutes to midnight ; for others , europe is a car accelerating towards the edge of a cliff .
for all , a per@@ il@@ ous existential moment is increasingly close at hand .
optimi@@ sts – fortunately , there remain a few , especially in europe itself – believe that when the situation becomes really critical , political leaders will turn things around and put europe back on the path of economic growth , job creation , and financial stability .
but pessimi@@ sts have been growing in number and influence .
they see political dys@@ function adding to financial tur@@ mo@@ il , thereby ampli@@ fying the euro@@ zone ’ s initial design flaws .
of course , who is ultimately proven correct is a function of euro@@ zone governments ’ willingness to make the difficult decisions that are required , and in a coordinated and tim@@ ely fashion .
but that is not the only determin@@ ant : governments must also be able to turn things around once the willingness to do so materi@@ alizes .
and here , the endless del@@ a@@ ys are making the challenges more daunting and the outcome more un@@ certain .
experienced obser@@ vers remind us that crises , rather than vision , have ten@@ ded to drive progress at critical stages of europe ’ s historic integration – a multi-@@ decade journey driven by the desire to ensure long-term peace and prosperity in what previously had been one of the world ’ s most violent regions and the site of app@@ alling human suffering .
after all , the european union ( including the euro@@ zone ’ s 17 members ) remains a collective of nation-@@ states with not@@ able diver@@ gen@@ ces in economic , financial , and social conditions .
political cycles are far from synchroni@@ zed .
and too many regional governance mechanisms , with the important exception of the european central bank , lack sufficient influence , credi@@ bility , and , therefore , effectiveness .
left to its own devices , such a grou@@ ping is vulnerable to recur@@ rent bi@@ ck@@ ering , disruptive post@@ uring , and disagreement over visions of the future .
as a result , progress towards meaningful economic and political integration can be pain@@ fully slow during the good times .
but all of this can change rapidly when a crisis lo@@ oms , especially if it threat@@ ens the integrity of the european project .
that is where the euro@@ zone is today .
a debt crisis that erup@@ ted in greece , the euro@@ zone ’ s outer peripher@@ y , has migr@@ ated with a ven@@ ge@@ ance towards the core , so much so that the survival of the euro@@ zone itself is at stake .
the more the policy response has la@@ gged , the broader the set of questions about europe ’ s future has become .
maintaining a 17@@ -@@ member mon@@ etary union is no longer a given .
talk of countries ex@@ iting , starting with greece ( the “ gre@@ x@@ it ” ) , is now ramp@@ ant .
and only hard-@@ core ide@@ alists dis@@ miss altogether the moun@@ ting risk of the euro@@ zone ’ s total dis@@ integration .
nonetheless , many veterans of the european integration project see a silver lining in the dark clouds mas@@ sing over their creation .
for them , only a crisis can stop politicians from just ki@@ cking various cans farther down the road and , instead , cataly@@ ze the policy initi@@ atives – greater fiscal , banking , and political union – that , together with mon@@ etary union , would ensure that the euro@@ zone re@@ sts on a stable and sustainable four-@@ legged platform .
but this view is not without its own risks .
it assumes that , when push comes to sho@@ ve , political leaders will indeed do what is necessary – the willingness question .
it also presum@@ es that they will have the capacity to do so – the ability question .
and , over time , uncertainty concern@@ ing the lat@@ ter question has ris@@ en to an uncomfortable level .
today ’ s euro@@ zone is bes@@ et by an unprecedented degree of reje@@ ction – on economic , financial , political , and social grounds – by citizens in a growing number of countries .
the longer this persi@@ sts , the harder it will be for politicians to maintain control of their countries ’ dest@@ in@@ ies and that of europe ’ s collective enterprise .
privat@@ e-@@ sector activity is slowing , and it is ne@@ aring a stand@@ still in the euro@@ zone ’ s most vulnerable economy ( greece ) , where a bank run is in full swing .
elsewhere , too , de@@ posit@@ ors are beginning to transfer their savings to the strongest economy ( germany ) and to safe ha@@ vens beyond ( switzerland and the united states ) .
weaker companies are she@@ dding labor , while stronger firms are del@@ a@@ ying investments in plant and equipment .
and global investors continue to exit the euro@@ zone in dro@@ ves , shifting countries ’ li@@ abilities to taxpa@@ yers and the ec@@ b ’ s balance sheet .
no wonder that social un@@ rest is evident in a growing number of countries .
no wonder that fr@@ inge political movements are gaining tra@@ ction throughout the euro@@ zone .
and no wonder that voters in almost two-thirds of euro@@ zone countries have turned out the in@@ cum@@ b@@ ents in their most recent elections .
all of this serves to under@@ mine the effectiveness of government policies – by reducing their credi@@ bility , clo@@ gging their channels of transmission to the economy , and making it difficult to off@@ set the with@@ dra@@ wal of privat@@ e-@@ sector capital and spending .
as a result , the market@@ -based economic and financial systems that pre@@ va@@ il in europe , and that , not so long ago , were a source of significant strength , are losing their vi@@ bran@@ cy .
i , too , am fond of metaphors .
during a trip to the continent last week , i heard one that captures very well the key dynamic in europe today .
the euro@@ zone ’ s leaders are on a raft heading towards a life-@@ threatening waterfall .
the longer they wait , the more the raft gains speed .
so the outcome no longer depends only on their willingness to cooperate in order to navigate the raft to safety .
it also hing@@ es on their ability to do so in the midst of natural forces that are increasingly difficult to control and overcome .
the message is clear .
the current crisis might indeed eventually break euro@@ zone leaders ’ inherent resistance to compromise , collaboration , and common action .
but the longer they bi@@ cker and di@@ ther , the greater the risk that what they gain in willingness will be lost to in@@ capacity .
will europe learn to love bush ?
president george w. bush will soon travel to europe , and president jacques chi@@ ra@@ c will visit washington .
eu “ foreign minister ” ja@@ vier sol@@ ana has already been there , and returned bu@@ lli@@ sh on future trans@@ atlantic cooperation .
atmosp@@ her@@ ically , at least , relations have , indeed , improved since the us presidential election , and both sides have expressed good will .
yet there is little ground for genuine optimism .
bush ’ s declared intention to “ better explain the reasons for his decisions ” to america ’ s allies simply will not do .
europeans don ’ t want explanations ; they want to be consul@@ ted – to have input into american decision-making and see their concerns reflected in us foreign policy .
on the contrary , the us is continuing to th@@ wart european efforts gradually to establish a ru@@ le-@@ based international order .
there are no signs that the bush administration is rel@@ enting on , for example , the un , the kyoto protocol , the international criminal court , the ban on land mines , or the anti-@@ bal@@ li@@ stic missile treaty .
in iraq , europeans fully share the american obje@@ ctives of preserving the country ’ s unity and achieving at least some mo@@ dic@@ um of democracy .
at the same time , they believe that it is up to the us to remove the chaos it created , so they are reluctant to contribute to the task in a substan@@ tive way .
european attitudes may seem short@@ sighted to americans , but it would need a lot of ca@@ j@@ ol@@ ing to change them .
there is general agreement on the aims to be achieved in the israeli@@ -@@ palestinian conflict : the end of violence and a peaceful solution based on the concept of two sovereig@@ n states .
however , europeans consider the opinion recently expressed by bush – that palestinian democracy and not israeli occupation of the west bank is at the core of the problem – to be ill conceived .
the same is true with respect to the president ’ s asser@@ tion that israel ’ s permanent presence in palestinian terri@@ tories and the non-@@ return of palestinian refugees to their homes in israel must be accepted as realities on the ground .
it may well be that such painful devi@@ ations from agreed principles will be reflected in an event@@ ual comprehensive settlement , but pre@@ jud@@ ging these issues before the beginning of negotiations den@@ ies the palestini@@ ans some of their most important bar@@ gaining chips .
on the question of iran ’ s nuclear weapons capability , americans and europeans also fundamentally agree : it should be prevented .
while the us tries to achieve this through hard power , regime change , san@@ ctions , and threats of pre-@@ emp@@ tive military intervention , europe uses soft power , diplomacy , inclu@@ sion , and partnership .
unfortunately , this “ good cop , bad cop ” game doesn ’ t work in international politics .
european efforts to indu@@ ce teheran to ren@@ ounce its nuclear designs by addressing iran ’ s legitimate security concerns and offering important opportunities for economic and social bet@@ ter@@ ment cannot be successful without active us support .
in other words , europe ’ s car@@ ro@@ ts are not enough ; a successful outcome requires american car@@ ro@@ ts , too .
by standing aside and dis@@ counting the european approach from the out@@ set , america is merely helping to bring about a self-@@ fulfilling prophe@@ cy .
it would be more productive for the us to join in , at the same time agre@@ eing with europeans on measures to be taken should their combined efforts fail .
relations with china have improved over the years on both sides of the atlantic .
china has become europe ’ s biggest trading partner , and its huge reserves of us dollars has made it america ’ s most important credi@@ tor .
despite this ro@@ sy picture , china could be the cause of a major trans@@ atlantic row if europeans make good on their intention to lift the arms export embar@@ go in place since the ti@@ an@@ an@@ men square mas@@ sac@@ re of 1989 .
the bush administration is fier@@ c@@ ely opposed to li@@ fting the embar@@ go , pointing out that in the event of a military clash over taiwan , us troops would face weapons provided to china by america ’ s own allies .
in fact , european as@@ sur@@ ances that arms sales to china could be controlled and threats to an ally avoi@@ ded do appear un@@ convincing .
on the other hand , economic inter@@ dependence between taiwan and main@@ land china has grown to such an extent that an armed conflict is increasingly unlikely .
of course , this would change were taiwan to push for independence , but it would hardly do so without a no@@ d from washington .
in short , on many of the most important current international issues , americans and europeans share the same obje@@ ctives and basic goals .
where they often diver@@ ge is in the means to achieve them .
political wisdom would demand that the two sides pool their consider@@ able resources and march together whenever possible .
this , however , requires a change of attitudes both in america and in europe .
bush must be willing to accept europeans as genuine partners and stop treating them like rec@@ al@@ cit@@ rant vas@@ s@@ als .
european leaders must overcome any lat@@ ent anti-@@ americ@@ an@@ ism and be prepared to make the kind of contributions to common endea@@ vors that would enti@@ tle them to equal partnership with the us .
will europe ’ s economies regain their foot@@ ing ?
stockholm – what will europe ’ s growth trajectory look like after the financial crisis ?
for some europeans , still nervous that their economies and banking systems might collapse , this is a little like asking a passenger on the titanic what they plan to do when they arrive in new york .
but it is a crucial question to ask , especially when europe has been facing so much outside pressure from the likes of the united states and the international mon@@ etary fund to focus on short-term ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian stimulus policies .
true , things are pretty ugly right now .
europe ’ s income is projected to fall a staggering 4 % this year .
unemployment will soon be in double digits throughout most of the continent , with spanish and lat@@ vi@@ an unemployment on track to exce@@ ed 20 % .
europe ’ s banking system remains sick@@ ly , even though many national governments have gone to great l@@ engths to hide their banks ’ wo@@ es .
yet , ugly or not , the down@@ turn will eventually end .
yes , there is still a real risk of hitting an iceberg , beginning perhaps with a default in the bal@@ tics , with panic first spreading to austria and some nor@@ dic countries .
but , for now , a complete mel@@ t@@ down seems distin@@ ctly less likely than gradu@@ al stabili@@ zation followed by a te@@ pid recovery , with so@@ aring debt levels and ling@@ ering high unemployment .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators have sava@@ ged europe ’ s policymakers for not orchestr@@ ating as aggressive a fiscal and mon@@ etary policy as their us counter@@ parts have .
why else is europe suffering a deeper recession than america , they complain , when everyone agrees that the us was the e@@ pic@@ enter of the global financial mel@@ t@@ down ?
but these cri@@ tics seem to pres@@ u@@ me that europe will come out of the crisis in far worse shape than the us , and it is too early to make that judgment .
an epic , finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ cris@@ is-@@ driven recession , such as the one we are still experiencing , is not a one-@@ year event .
so policymakers ’ responses cannot be evalu@@ ated by short-term measures , either .
it is just as important to ask what happens over the next five years as over the next six months , and the jury is still very much out on that .
america ’ s hyper-@@ aggressive fiscal response means a faster rise in government debt , while its hyper-@@ expan@@ sive mon@@ etary policy means that an exit strategy to mop up all the excess liqui@@ dity will be difficult to ex@@ ec@@ ute .
government spending in the us has ris@@ en in short order from 18 % to 28 % of income , while the us federal reserve has effectively tri@@ pled its balance sheet .
europe ’ s more temper@@ ed approach , while magni@@ fying short-term risks , could pay off in the long run , especially if global interest rates rise , making it far more painful to carry over@@ sized debt loads .
the real question is not whether europe is using suffici@@ ently aggressive ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian stimulus , but whether europe will res@@ u@@ me its economic reform efforts as the crisis ab@@ ates .
if europe continues to make its labor markets more flexible , its financial market regulation more genuinely pan@@ -@@ european , and remains open to trade , trend growth can pick up again in the wake of the crisis .
if european countries look in@@ ward , however , with germany pushing its consumers to buy german cars , the french government forcing car companies to keep un@@ productive factories open , etc . , one can expect a decade of stag@@ nation .
admit@@ tedly , the past year has not been a proud one for policy reform in europe .
rec@@ essions have never proven an easy time for european leaders to push forward with reforms .
matters were not helped when the c@@ ze@@ ch government lost a confidence vote mid@@ way through its six-@@ month pres@@ iden@@ cy of the european union , leaving a l@@ ame duck european commission .
the shadow of for@@ th@@ coming elections in germany , together with concern over whether ir@@ ish voters will rati@@ fy the li@@ s@@ bon treaty ( giving europe a badly needed new constitution ) , has conspi@@ red to im@@ pe@@ de reform momentum .
yet europe ’ s many strengths , including strong democratic governments and sound legal institutions , are often under-@@ r@@ ated as long-term competitive strengths in today ’ s globalized economy .
the recent recession has presented challenges , but european leaders were right to avoid becoming in@@ to@@ xic@@ ated with short-term ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian policies , especially where these are ini@@ mi@@ cal to addressing europe ’ s long-term challenges .
if reform res@@ um@@ es , there is no reason why europe should not enjoy a decade of per capita income growth at least as high as that of the us .
moreover , with growing concerns about the sustainability of us fiscal policy , the euro has a huge opportunity to play a significantly larger role as a reserve currency .
one shu@@ d@@ ders to think what will happen if europe does not pull out of its current funk .
certainly , europe would lose tra@@ ction as a badly needed counter@@ weight to the us in world economic policy .
europeans may not mind this right now ( one sees more obama t-shirts in europe than in the us ) , but they might not be so happy if a george bush i@@ ii comes along .
fortunately , europeans will probably not wait so long to start moving ahead again .
will europe &apos;s financial revolution continue ?
over the last two decades europe experienced a dramatic expansion of financial markets at the expense of its traditional system of finan@@ cing based on close relationships between large banks and established firms .
since 1980 the ratio of stock market capit@@ alization to gdp so@@ ared more than 13-@@ fold , while equity finan@@ cing rose 16-@@ fold .
in 1980 , stock market capit@@ alization relative to gdp was five times greater in the us and uk than in contin@@ ental europe ; by 2000 , it was only 60 % higher .
dis@@ closure standards improved throughout the continent , as did laws to protect minority share@@ holders .
for example , before 1980 no member of today &apos;s european union , except france and sweden , had an anti-@@ insi@@ der trading la@@ w-@@ -@@ and in sweden the law , although introduced in 1971 , was not en@@ forced for the first time until 1990 .
by 2000 , all eu members had anti-@@ insi@@ der trading laws and most were en@@ forcing them .
what caused this change ?
is it benef@@ iting all eu countries , and will it persist as eu en@@ lar@@ gement proce@@ eds ?
relation@@ shi@@ p-@@ based financial systems perform better when markets and firms are smaller , when legal protection is weaker , there is little public information , and innovation is incremental .
banks tend to have close , long-term , and protective ties with the managers of such firms , primarily because the bank &apos;s hol@@ dings are il@@ liquid .
this can provide consider@@ able stabili@@ ty-@@ -@@ indeed , the second half of the 20th century saw only four german firms suc@@ cum@@ b to hostile take@@ over@@ s-@@ -@@ but at the cost of reducing access to finance and cur@@ ta@@ iling future opportunities .
by contrast , market@@ -based financial systems perform better when economies and firms are bigger and more form@@ ally organized , with better legal en@@ for@@ cement and transparency , and when innovation is constant .
a market@@ -based system gives new firm@@ s-@@ -@@ hence new technologi@@ es-@@ -@@ more chances to ob@@ tain finan@@ cing , because many investors ass@@ ess firms independently .
but financial systems do not emerge as a result of their super@@ i@@ ority in a particular environment .
vest@@ ed interests dist@@ ort the process of evolution .
over the last decade , trade liber@@ alization and mon@@ etary integration supported the expansion of market@@ -based finan@@ cing in europe .
trade integration exposed domestic banks and firms to foreign competition , limit@@ ing national governments &apos; ability to intervene on behalf of favor@@ ed domestic companies .
similarly , the european commission de@@ em@@ ed subsidies to publi@@ cl@@ y-@@ owned firms illegal if they distorted competition across member states , while the fiscal discipline imposed by the euro ended pervasive general government credit subsi@@ dies@@ -@@ -@@ the essential lu@@ bri@@ c@@ ant of relation@@ shi@@ p-@@ based systems .
moreover , the volume of corporate debt se@@ curi@@ ties almost tri@@ pled after the introduction of the euro eliminated ex@@ chan@@ ge-@@ rate risk .
the european commission also opened up the market for corporate control by ve@@ to@@ ing the barriers against hostile take@@ over@@ s that most eu governments had erec@@ ted .
but now that europe &apos;s internal economic boundaries have been mostly removed , and the political objective has shifted to political uni@@ fication , integration may no longer be so market@@ -@@ friendly .
the more political power is centralized , the more the central authority can interfere with market development .
the pro-@@ market bias that characterized eu policy up to now ( with not@@ able exceptions , such as agricultural policy ) may well shift in the opposite direction .
in trade zones formed by hetero@@ gene@@ ous states , vest@@ ed interests tend to be diverse and find it hard to lobby at the supr@@ an@@ ational level .
political integration , by contrast , might have an opposite effect on the development of markets .
the threat of capital flight to nearby political entities creates a strong incentive to keep policies market@@ -@@ friendly , but it is supp@@ ressed when neighbor@@ ing political entities co@@ al@@ es@@ ce .
in@@ cum@@ bent finan@@ ci@@ ers , meanwhile , have a powerful vest@@ ed interest in op@@ posing a market@@ -based system , which favor@@ s credit evaluation and risk management over their main `@@ `@@ skill &apos; &apos; : being well connected .
they also have the ability to organize successfully against the market , particularly in small countries , where in@@ cum@@ b@@ ents form a well-@@ defined group whose members often atten@@ ded the same elite schools , frequent the same clubs , and inter@@ marry .
the question is not whether europe should move toward a market@@ -based financial system . the real question is whether europe re@@ tains the political will to continue to do so , and whether eu countries can streng@@ then the institutions necessary to re@@ ap the full benefits of financial markets .
there is a serious danger that reforms that facili@@ tate markets will benefit northern europe but harm under@@ developed regions in southern europe by depri@@ ving them of the relation@@ shi@@ p-@@ based system .
in these regions , higher rates of corruption and tax ev@@ asion , together with smaller average firm size , under@@ mine the production of credible information that financial markets need .
partly for this reason , eu en@@ lar@@ gement is super@@ i@@ or-@@ -@@ at least for financial market@@ s-@@ -@@ to political uni@@ fication , which encoura@@ ges vest@@ ed interests to lobby at the central level .
indeed , one benefit of the european commission &apos;s rule that some decisions must be un@@ anim@@ ous is that its im@@ pe@@ des the exercise of monopoly power , thus reducing the risk that centralized authority will be used against markets .
this is all the more important because leaders in both the us and europe are beginning to pan@@ der to the anti-@@ globalization movement .
america &apos;s corporate sc@@ and@@ als have under@@ min@@ ed the market &apos;s moral standing , while the end of the internet bubble has weak@@ ened its economic credi@@ bility .
the ad@@ verse distribu@@ tive effects of market@@ -based finance may serve to further streng@@ then anti-@@ market forces in europe , especially in southern europe .
the eu can bu@@ ck this anti-@@ market trend by promoting structural reforms in southern european countries and foc@@ us@@ sing on en@@ lar@@ gement to increase economic competition .
but it should maintain a clear division of power between local and central authorities at all levels to maintain strong competition and a healthy diversity of interests .
will ex-@@ mexic@@ ans choose america ’ s next president ?
among the many surprises during the republican party presidential candidates ’ deb@@ ates a couple of weeks ago was the re@@ kind@@ led importance of immigration .
after the failure of president george w. bush ’ s and senator edward kennedy ’ s comprehensive immigration reform effort last spring , most obser@@ vers thought the matter would remain dor@@ m@@ ant until 2009 , since even touching it was potentially fatal for democrats and republicans alike .
but as democrats discovered in other recent deb@@ ates , and as republicans realized with a little help from the cnn organi@@ zers , who ske@@ wed the questions toward issues they feel strongly about , immigration is an issue that just won ’ t go away .
this is one reason why i wrote a short but – i hope – useful book on mexican immigration to the united states , entitled ex-@@ me@@ x : from migr@@ ants to immigr@@ ants .
based on internal documents from the mexican and us governments , countless interviews , and a survey of much of the existing literature on the subject , ex-@@ me@@ x see@@ ks to fulfill three purposes .
first , i wanted to provide a mexican voice in the immigration debate .
mexic@@ ans make up more than half of the flow and stock – legal or not – of all immigr@@ ants in the us , but a point of view attemp@@ ting to reflect their interests and aspirations has been largely ab@@ sent from the american discussion .
of course , my book cannot be the mexican stance .
but an assessment from the van@@ tage point of past , current , and future mexican immigr@@ ants to the us is a necessary component of the american debate – all the more so when one rec@@ alls that immigration has , in fact , not generally been exclu@@ sively a domestic us policy question .
the first american immigration agreement with another country was signed in 190@@ 7 – the so-called gentleman ’ s agreement with japan , while the us and mexico negoti@@ ated and admini@@ stered the bra@@ cer@@ o program for more than twenty years , from 194@@ 2 thr@@ u 196@@ 4 .
and , of course , the us has had a standing immigration agreement since 1965 with a country most americans would not imagine : fi@@ del ca@@ stro ’ s cuba .
second , it is important to place the current , raging debate in historical context .
the most important feature of that context is that the actual flow of mexic@@ ans entering the us today is not much greater than the overall average figure for the bra@@ cer@@ o program period : around 400,000 per year .
it is similarly important to understand the evolution of us legislation on immigration since the 19@@ 20 ’ s , and the shifts and hypo@@ cris@@ y involved in the application of those laws .
for example , the 1996 immigration reforms implemented by the clinton administration , along with other , underlying structural trends , hal@@ ted the traditional circular pattern where@@ by mexic@@ ans came and went to the us every year .
instead , they began to settle in communities farther from the border , greatly increasing the stock of mexic@@ ans in the us .
finally , the efforts of the mexican and us governments since 2001 to reach an accommo@@ dation on the issue have not been well understood .
confi@@ den@@ tial papers from the bush and fox admini@@ strations show that talks went further than previously known .
the us , and particularly th@@ en-@@ secretary of state co@@ lin po@@ well , was willing , as stated in a un@@ classified mem@@ o addressed to bush in late august 2001 , to go to great l@@ engths to reach an understanding with mexico on the issue .
indeed , the substance of the negotiations was not much different from the content of the bush-@@ kennedy “ grand bar@@ gain ” that was fashioned in 2007 .
the elec@@ toral numbers perhaps best explain the immigration equation ’ s importance in today ’ s presidential campaigns .
in 2008 , it is likely that lat@@ in@@ os will make up 9 % to 10 % of the elec@@ tor@@ ate , the highest share ever .
they will wi@@ eld decisi@@ ve importance in swing states like colorado , new mexico , florida , and nevada .
having made significant in@@ roads among his@@ panic voters in 2000 and 2004 , thanks to bush ’ s support for immigration reform , republicans now can barely count on 20 % of that total – mainly among cu@@ ban@@ -@@ americans – thanks to their stri@@ dent anti-@@ immigration stance .
thus , if the democrats demonstrate a minimum of compassion , sensitivity , and re@@ alism , they can count on a 7 % advantage in the popular vote .
but doing so could cost democrats de@@ arly in old industrial states like pennsylvania , ohio , and michigan , where the arri@@ val of mexican migr@@ ants , transformed into immigr@@ ants , has sto@@ ked passions .
since the democrats ’ victory will most likely depend on these states , the democratic candidate who can square this circle , or the republican who can break it , may well win the pres@@ iden@@ cy .
the hol@@ lo@@ wing out of the g@@ 20
washington , dc – in the run@@ -up to this year ’ s g@@ 20 summit in bu@@ en@@ os aires , obser@@ vers have been bu@@ zzing about the meeting between chinese president x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping and us president don@@ ald trum@@ p .
but with the announcement that the current international b@@ ê@@ te no@@ ire , saudi cro@@ wn prince mohammed bin salman ( m@@ bs ) , would attend the event , followed by russia ’ s na@@ val attack against ukra@@ ini@@ an ships in the ker@@ ch stra@@ it , that meeting suddenly seems like an after@@ thought .
now , instead of jo@@ st@@ ling for pictures of trum@@ p and x@@ i , the world ’ s media will be dis@@ se@@ cting interactions between m@@ bs , accused of or@@ dering the brutal torture and murder of the us-@@ based saudi journalist ja@@ mal k@@ has@@ ho@@ g@@ gi in the saudi consu@@ late in istanbul , and turkish president re@@ ce@@ p ta@@ y@@ yi@@ p er@@ do@@ ğ@@ an .
those between russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin with german chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a mer@@ kel – which would have been uncomfortable even without the recent attack on ukra@@ ine – will also be heavily scru@@ tin@@ ized .
none of this is the point of a g@@ 20 summit .
what used to be an effective forum of global governance has now de@@ generated into a kind of kab@@ u@@ ki theater – a fai@@ thful reflection of the extent to which the global order has lost its way .
after the global financial crisis erup@@ ted in 2008 , the g@@ 20 acted as an international crisis committee , mi@@ tig@@ ating the disaster by inje@@ cting liqui@@ dity into markets worldwide .
the effectiveness of the g@@ 20 ’ s 2008 and 2009 sum@@ mit@@ s raised hopes that , at a time of rapid change , this emerging platform , com@@ prising economies accounting for 85 % of world output , could serve as a global fire briga@@ de .
not bound by proce@@ du@@ ral rules or legal stri@@ c@@ tures , the g@@ 20 could respond quickly when needed .
there was even talk of the g@@ 20 interven@@ ing in a wider range of areas , potentially even ec@@ lip@@ sing the united nations security council .
but , as is so often the case , as the sense of urgency wan@@ ed , so did the will to tackle deep structural challenges .
important pro@@ pos@@ als , such as international mon@@ etary fund voting reforms , were not implemented .
at the same time , the g@@ 20 ’ s agenda became clu@@ ttered with issues – from climate change to gender equality – making it less a platform for action than a discussion forum , at a time when what the world really needs is a pro@@ active and dynamic player .
to be sure , the g@@ 20 has offered a convenient framework to coordinate responses and , sometimes , to generate and dissemin@@ ate innovative policy ideas , such as those rel@@ ating to energy transi@@ tions and infrastructure finance .
but even that limited func@@ tionality has lately been ob@@ scu@@ red , o@@ wing largely to trum@@ p ’ s treatment of multi@@ lat@@ eral for@@ a not as important mechanisms to coordinate international action , but rather as opportunities to project strength .
the recent asi@@ a-@@ pacific economic cooperation summit in papua new guinea is a case in point .
sin@@ o-@@ american competition , rather than concrete policy responses or coordination , dominated discussions , to the point that the summit did not even end with a final comm@@ uniqu@@ é – a first in ape@@ c ’ s 25-@@ year history .
similarly , at this june ’ s g@@ 7 summit in que@@ be@@ c , trum@@ p with@@ drew us support for the final comm@@ uniqu@@ é , following a personal sp@@ at with canadian prime minister justin tru@@ de@@ au .
now , the g@@ 20 is little more than a theater of power .
images of m@@ bs at the summit , interacting with fellow world leaders , will shift the narrative away from his actions , sign@@ aling a tac@@ it international acceptance of his behavior and opening the way for a return to the status quo .
similarly , if the summit conclu@@ des without any unified con@@ dem@@ nation of russia ’ s actions in the ker@@ ch stra@@ it , pu@@ tin will have sc@@ ored an important victory : the international community ’ s tac@@ it acceptance of his illegal an@@ nex@@ ation of cri@@ me@@ a .
even if european leaders offer some criticism , this is likely only to highlight dee@@ pen@@ ing di@@ visions in the event that the us doesn ’ t back them – a consol@@ ation prize for pu@@ tin .
( in this respect , trum@@ p ’ s suggestion that he may can@@ cel a planned meeting with pu@@ tin because of the incident is a positive sign . )
could the hope of using the g@@ 20 summit to norm@@ alize his aggression against ukra@@ ine have informed pu@@ tin ’ s decision to raise a freedom of navigation issue in the ker@@ ch stra@@ it at this particular moment ?
the de@@ terior@@ ation of the g@@ 20 into a platform for narrow , self-@@ serving , and ima@@ ge-@@ focused gam@@ bits is a symptom of a ru@@ d@@ der@@ less global order . with no clear impulse for reform and a lack of international leadership , the g@@ 20 is ad@@ rift .
as long as those who should be steering the ship are pre@@ occupied with phot@@ o-@@ ops , it will not get back on course .
this does not have to be the case .
g@@ 20 leaders can – and should – refuse to smile for the cameras and swe@@ ep everything under the ru@@ g .
their con@@ dem@@ nation of pu@@ tin and m@@ bs will not change either leader ’ s behavior . but it will send the message that , at the very least , right and wrong still have meaning on the international stage .
the g@@ 20 is no longer an agent of action or even an agen@@ da-@@ se@@ tter .
the least our leaders can do is prevent it from becoming a vehicle for legiti@@ mating illegal acts .
it is a low bar , but that is where we are .
will global im@@ balances return ?
beijing – future history books , depending on where they are written , will take one of two approaches to as@@ signing blame for the world ’ s current financial and economic crisis .
one approach will blame la@@ x regulation , accommo@@ dating mon@@ etary policy , and inadequate savings in the united states .
the other , already being pushed by former and current us officials like alan green@@ span and ben ber@@ nan@@ ke , will blame the immense pool of liqui@@ dity generated by high-@@ savings countries in east asia and the middle east .
all that liqui@@ dity , they will argue , had to go somewhere . its logical destination was the country with the deepest financial markets , the us , where it raised asset prices to unsustainable heights .
note the one thing on which members of both camps agree : the global savings imbalance – low savings in the us and high savings in china and other emerging markets – played a key role in the crisis by allowing americans to live beyond their means .
it encouraged finan@@ ci@@ ers desperate to earn a return on abundant funds to put them to more specu@@ lative use .
if there is a consensus on one issue , it is the im@@ possibility of understanding the bubble and the crash without considering the role of global im@@ balances .
preventing future crises similar to this one therefore requires resol@@ ving the problem of global im@@ balances .
here , the early signs are reas@@ suring .
american households are saving again .
the us trade deficit has declined from $ 60 billion a month to just $ 26 billion , according to the most recent data .
as a matter of simple arithmetic , we know that the rest of the world is running correspon@@ d@@ ingly smaller sur@@ pl@@ uses .
but once american households rebuild their retirement accounts , they may return to their pro@@ fli@@ gate ways .
indeed , the obama administration and the federal reserve are doing all they can to pump up us spending .
the only reason the us trade deficit is falling is that the country remains in a severe recession , causing us impor@@ ts and exports to collapse in parallel .
with recovery , both may recover to previous levels , and the 6 % -@@ of-@@ gdp us external deficit will be back .
in fact , there has been no change in relative prices or de@@ preci@@ ation of the us dollar of a magnitude that would augu@@ r a permanent shift in trade and spending patterns .
whether there is a permanent reduction in global im@@ balances will depend mainly on decisions taken outside the us , specifically in countries like china .
one ’ s forecast of those decisions hing@@ es , in turn , on why these other countries came to run such large sur@@ pl@@ uses in the first place .
one view is that their sur@@ pl@@ uses were a cor@@ oll@@ ary of the policies favor@@ ing ex@@ port-@@ led growth that worked so well for so long . china ’ s leaders are understand@@ ably reluctant to abandon a trie@@ d-@@ and-@@ true model .
they can ’ t re@@ structure their economy inst@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously .
they can ’ t move workers from painting children ’ s toys in gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong to building schools in western china overnight .
they need time to build a social safety net capable of encouraging chinese households to reduce their pre@@ cau@@ tionary saving .
if this view is correct , we can expect to see global im@@ balances re-@@ emerge once the recession is over and to un@@ wind only slowly there@@ after .
the other view is that china contributed to global im@@ balances not through its mer@@ chand@@ ise exports , but through its capital exports .
what china lac@@ ked was not demand for consumption goods , but a supply of high-@@ quality financial assets .
it found these in the us , mainly in the form treas@@ ury and other govern@@ ment-@@ backed se@@ curi@@ ties , in turn pushing other investors into more specu@@ lative investments .
recent events have not enhanced the stat@@ ure of the us as a supp@@ lier of high-@@ quality assets .
and china , for its part , will continue to develop its financial markets and its capacity to generate high-@@ quality financial assets intern@@ ally .
but doing so will take time .
meanwhile , the us still has the most liquid financial markets in the world .
this interpretation again impli@@ es the re-@@ emergence of global im@@ balances once the recession ends , and their very gradu@@ al un@@ win@@ ding there@@ after .
one development that could change this forecast is if china comes to view investing in us financial assets as a mon@@ e@@ y-@@ losing proposition .
us budget defic@@ its as far as the eye can see might ex@@ ci@@ te fear of losses on us treas@@ ury bonds .
a de fac@@ to policy of in@@ fl@@ ating away the debt might sto@@ ke such fears further .
at that point , china would pull the plug , the dollar would crash , and the fed would be forced to raise interest rates , pl@@ ung@@ ing the us back into recession .
there are two hopes for avoiding this disa@@ strous outcome .
one is rel@@ ying on chinese good@@ will to stabilize the us and world economies .
the other is for the obama administration and the fed to provide details about how they will eliminate the budget deficit and avoid inflation once the recession ends .
the second option is clearly prefer@@ able .
after all , it is always better to control one ’ s own fate .
will governmental fol@@ ly now allow for a cyber crisis ?
cambridge – when the financial crisis of 2008 hit , many shocked cri@@ tics asked why markets , regul@@ ators , and financial experts failed to see it coming .
today , one might ask the same question about the global economy ’ s vulnerability to cyber-@@ attack .
indeed , the parall@@ els between financial crises and the threat of cyber mel@@ t@@ downs are striking .
although the greatest cyber threat comes from ro@@ gue states with the capacity to develop extremely sophisticated computer viruses , risks can also come from an@@ archi@@ stic hackers and terrorists , or even from computer gli@@ tches com@@ po@@ unded by natural catastrophe .
a few security experts have voic@@ ed great alarm , including , most recently , jonathan ev@@ ans , the head of the british security service ( mi@@ 5 ) .
by and large , however , few leaders are willing to compromise growth in the tech sector or the internet in any significant way in the name of a threat that is so am@@ orph@@ ous .
instead , they prefer to establish relatively inno@@ cu@@ ous working groups and task forces .
it is difficult to over@@ state the dependence of modern economies on large-scale computer systems .
but imagine if one day a host of key communications satellites were in@@ capac@@ it@@ ated , or the databases of major financial systems were er@@ ased .
experts have long identified the electricity grid as the most acute vulnerability , since any modern economy would collapse without power .
true , many skep@@ tics argue that with reasonable low-cost pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measures , large scale cyber-@@ mel@@ t@@ downs are highly im@@ plau@@ sible , and that do@@ om@@ -@@ mon@@ gers over@@ state the wor@@ st-@@ case scenarios .
they say that the ability of cyber-@@ terrorists and black@@ mail@@ ers to take the global economy to the br@@ ink , as in the 2007 bruce willi@@ s movie die hard 4 , is utterly fic@@ tional .
it is difficult to judge who is right , and there are important experts on both sides of the debate .
but there do seem to be an uncomfortable number of similarities between the political economy of cyberspace regulation and of financial regulation .
first , both cyber-@@ security and financial stability are extremely complex topics with which government regul@@ ators can hardly keep up .
industry rem@@ uner@@ ation for experts is far in excess of any publi@@ c-@@ sector salary , and the best minds are continually bid away .
as a result , some argue that the only solution is reli@@ ance on self-@@ regulation by the software industry .
one hears this argument for many modern industries , from big food to big phar@@ ma to big finance .
second , like the financial sector , the tech industry is enormously influential politically through contributions and lo@@ bb@@ ying .
in the united states , all presidential candidates must make pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ges to silicon valley and other tech centers to raise money .
exc@@ essive finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ sector influence was , of course , a root cause of the 2008 mel@@ t@@ down and remains deeply implic@@ ated in today ’ s continuing euro@@ zone mess .
third , with slowing growth in advanced economies , information technology seems to hold the moral high ground , just as finance did until five years ago .
and crude attempts by governments to en@@ force regulation are likely to prove in@@ effective in protecting against catastrophe , while all too effective in stran@@ gling growth .
in both cases – financial stability and cyber security – the risk of contagi@@ on creates a situation in which a we@@ dge can form between private incentives and social risks .
admit@@ tedly , progress in the technology sector overall often produces huge soci@@ al-@@ welfare gains , which arguably out@@ strip those produced by all other sectors in recent decades .
but , just as with nuclear power plants , progress can go aw@@ ry in the absence of good regulation .
finally , the greatest risks come from arrogan@@ ce and ignorance , two human characteristics at the heart of most financial crises .
recent revel@@ ations about the super-@@ viruses “ stu@@ x@@ net ” and “ fl@@ ame ” are particularly dis@@ concer@@ ting .
these viruses , apparently developed by the us and israel to dis@@ rupt iran ’ s nuclear program , em@@ body a level of sophistication far beyond anything previously seen .
both are deeply encryp@@ ted and difficult to detect once inside a computer .
the fl@@ ame virus has the capacity to take over a computer ’ s peripher@@ als , record skype conversations , take pictures through a computer ’ s camera , and transmit information via blue@@ tooth to any nearby device .
if the world ’ s most sophisticated governments are developing computer viruses , what guarantee is there that something won ’ t go aw@@ ry ?
how can we be sure that they won ’ t “ escape ” and infect a much broader class of systems , or be adopted for other uses , or that future ro@@ gue states or terrorists won ’ t find a way to turn them on their creators ?
no economy is more vulnerable than the us , and it is arrogan@@ ce to believe that us cyber super@@ i@@ ority ( to all except perhaps china ) provides it with im@@ penetr@@ able security from attack .
unfortunately the solution is not so simple as just building better anti-@@ virus programs .
virus protection and virus development constit@@ ute an un@@ even arms race .
a virus can be just a couple hundred lines of computer code , compared to hundreds of thousands of lines for anti-@@ virus programs , which must be designed to detect wide classes of enemies .
we are told not to worry about large-scale cyber mel@@ t@@ downs , because none has occurred , and governments are being vi@@ gil@@ ant .
unfortunately , another lesson of the financial crisis is that most politicians are con@@ gen@@ it@@ ally in@@ capable of making difficult choices until risks actually materi@@ alize .
let us hope that we are lucky for a while longer .
will greece go to the imf ?
washington , dc – traditionally , “ you should go to the imf ” was not something you would say to friendly neighbors and close allies .
over the past few decades , the international mon@@ etary fund became associated with exc@@ essive fiscal au@@ ster@@ ity , extreme political in@@ sensitivity , and – since the asian financial crisis of 199@@ 7-@@ 1998 – with an out@@ -and-@@ out stigma .
countries bor@@ rowed from the imf only under dur@@ ess , when all else failed – and when there was simply no other way to pay for essential impor@@ ts .
( for iceland in the fall of 2008 , for example , the only alternative to imf finan@@ cing was to eat locally obtained goods , which mostly means fish . )
but the imf has changed a great deal in recent years , largely under the au@@ sp@@ ices of domini@@ que str@@ aus@@ s-@@ kahn , its current managing director .
str@@ aus@@ s-@@ kahn , a former french finance minister and con@@ tender for the soci@@ alist nom@@ ination for the french pres@@ iden@@ cy , has pushed through changes that allow the imf to l@@ end without conditions in some circumstances , and to give greater priority to protecting social safety nets ( including unemployment benefits and healthcare systems ) .
he has also moved the fund decisi@@ vely away from its obsession with fiscal au@@ ster@@ ity measures ( a big early mistake – with lasting traumatic consequences – in indonesia and korea in late 1997 ) .
greece und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly has serious problems today .
t he great opportunities offered by european integration have been largely squ@@ ander@@ ed .
and lower interest rates over the past decade – brought down to german levels through greece being allowed , rather gener@@ ously , into the euro zone – led to little more than further defic@@ its and a dangerous buil@@ du@@ p of government debt .
germany and france – as de fac@@ to leaders of the european union – are ha@@ g@@ gling over a bel@@ ated support package , but they have made it abund@@ antly clear that greece must slash publi@@ c-@@ sector wages and other spending .
greek trade uni@@ ons know what this means – and are in the streets .
if greece still had its own currency , everything would be easier .
just as in the case of the united kingdom since 2008 , the greek exchange rate would de@@ preci@@ ate shar@@ ply .
this would lower the cost of labor , restor@@ ing competi@@ tiveness ( as in asia after 199@@ 7-@@ 98 ) while also in@@ fl@@ ating asset prices and thereby helping bor@@ ro@@ wers who are underwater on their mort@@ g@@ ages and other deb@@ ts .
but , with greece and other troubled euro@@ -@@ zone economies ( known to their de@@ tra@@ ctors as the pi@@ ig@@ s : portugal , ireland , italy , greece , and spain ) having sur@@ rendered mon@@ etary policy to the european central bank ( ec@@ b ) in frank@@ fur@@ t , their curren@@ cies cannot fall in this fashion .
so greece – and arguably the pi@@ ig@@ s more generally – are left with the need to cur@@ tail demand massively , lower wages , and reduce the publi@@ c-@@ sector workforce .
the last time we saw this kind of precipit@@ ate fiscal au@@ ster@@ ity – when countries were tied to the gold standard – it contributed directly to the onset of the great depression in the 19@@ 30 ’ s .
this is a situation tail@@ or-@@ made for str@@ aus@@ s-@@ kahn and the “ new imf ” to ride to the rescue .
since early 2009 , the fund has had significantly greater resources to l@@ end to countries in trouble , to cus@@ hi@@ on the blow of crisis , and to offer a form of international circu@@ it-@@ break@@ er when it looks like the lights might otherwise go out .
the idea is not to prevent necessary adju@@ st@@ ments – for example , in the form of bud@@ ge@@ t-@@ deficit reduction – but to spread them out over time , to restore confidence , and to serve as an external seal of approval on a government ’ s credi@@ bility .
t he imf was created in the wan@@ ing days of world war ii , essentially as a united stat@@ es-@@ west european partnership .
europe re@@ tains strong representation at the fund , and has always chosen its top leader – in fact , most emerging markets ( in asia , latin america , and africa ) complain that europe is over@@ represented and has far too much say in how the fund operates .
yet at this moment of growing european crisis , while there is still time to act , the fund is confined to the si@@ del@@ ines .
this is partly because german chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a mer@@ kel , currently maneu@@ vering to ensure that a german is the next head of the ec@@ b , does not want the fund to become more involved in euro@@ -@@ zone policies .
the imf might reasonably take the position that ec@@ b policies have been over@@ ly contra@@ c@@ tionary – resul@@ ting in a strong euro and very low inflation – and are no longer appropriate for member countries in the midst of a financial collapse .
if the imf were to support europe ’ s weaker economies , this would challenge the prevail@@ ing ideology among frank@@ fur@@ t-@@ dominated policy makers .
but the real reason is much simpler .
when french president ni@@ col@@ as sar@@ ko@@ zy put forward str@@ aus@@ s-@@ kahn ’ s name to run the imf , he meant to park a past and potentially future ri@@ val in a far@@ away place about which people cared little .
then the global financial crisis hit , and str@@ aus@@ s-@@ kahn was propelled to center stage .
with france ’ s next presidential election fast approaching in 2012 , the last thing sar@@ ko@@ zy now needs is for str@@ aus@@ s-@@ kahn to play a stat@@ es@@ man@@ -like role in saving the euro zone .
we can expect to hear all kinds of mis@@ leading excuses from eu sources for exclu@@ ding the imf : “ the fund is too american , ” “ europe must resolve its own problems , ” and “ the imf is not appropriate to our circumstances . ” given the magnitude of the greek crisis , they will all ring hol@@ low .
sometimes history is driven by deep forces beyond our control , and sometimes by sheer chance .
and at other times , like now , much that hangs in the balance is affected by the deliber@@ ate , personal , and short-term tac@@ tical consider@@ ations of people running for election .
the eu ’ s leaders will try hard to keep the imf at bay .
this is not good news for greece – or for anyone who cares about global financial stability .
will greece make it ?
cambridge – greece has bought some time with a new package of financial support , but the country is not out of the woods yet .
it remains to be seen whether the sou@@ pe@@ d-up au@@ ster@@ ity policies that prime minister george pa@@ p@@ andre@@ o@@ u ’ s government has promised will prove to be politically acceptable and sustainable .
history suggests some grounds for skep@@ ticism .
in a democracy , when the demands of financial markets and foreign credi@@ tors clash with those of domestic workers , pension@@ ers , and the middle class , it is usually the loc@@ als who have the last say .
britain ’ s exit from the gold standard in 193@@ 1 remains the historical land@@ mark .
having made the mistake of restor@@ ing par@@ ity with gold at a level that left the economy desperately un@@ competitive , britain struggled for several years with def@@ lation and rising unemployment .
industries such as coal , steel , and shi@@ p@@ building were hit hard , and labor stri@@ fe became ramp@@ ant .
even as unemployment reached 20 % , the bank of england was obli@@ ged to maintain high interest rates in order to prevent a massive out@@ flow of gold .
eventually , increasing finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ market pressure pushed the country off gold in september 193@@ 1 .
it wasn ’ t the first time that financial prob@@ ity had required the real economy to suffer under the gold standard .
what was different was that britain had become a more democratic society : the working class had become uni@@ oni@@ zed , the political franch@@ ise had expanded four@@ fold since the end of world war i , mass media publi@@ ci@@ zed ordinary people ’ s economic p@@ light , and a soci@@ alist movement was waiting in the wings .
despite their own instincts , central bankers and their political masters understood that they could no longer remain alo@@ of from the consequences of economic recession and high unemployment .
even more importantly , investors understood this , too .
as soon as financial markets begin to question the credi@@ bility of a government ’ s commitment to a fixed exchange rate , they become a force for inst@@ ability .
at the sli@@ ghtest hint of things going aw@@ ry , investors and de@@ posit@@ ors pull up stakes and move capital out of the country , thereby precipit@@ ating the collapse of the currency .
this movie was re@@ played in argentina in the late 1990 ’ s .
the lin@@ ch@@ pin of argentina ’ s economic strategy after 1991 was the conver@@ ti@@ bility law , which legally an@@ ch@@ ored the pes@@ o to the us dollar at a one-@@ to-one exchange rate and prohi@@ bited restri@@ ctions on capital flows .
argent@@ ine economy minister dom@@ ingo cav@@ all@@ o en@@ visi@@ oned the conver@@ ti@@ bility law as both a harness and an engine for the economy .
the strategy worked well initially by bringing mu@@ ch-@@ needed price stability .
but , by the end of the decade , the argent@@ ine nightmare had returned with a ven@@ ge@@ ance .
the asian financial crisis and the brazilian de@@ valu@@ ation in early 1999 left the argent@@ ine@@ an pes@@ o looking deci@@ de@@ dly over@@ valued .
doub@@ ts about argentina ’ s ability to service its external debt multiplied , confidence collapsed , and before too long , argentina ’ s credi@@ t@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess sli@@ d below that of some african countries .
ultimately , what sealed argentina ’ s fate was not its leaders ’ lack of political will , but rather their inability to impose ever-@@ more costly policies on their domestic constitu@@ ents .
in fact , the argent@@ ine government was willing to ab@@ ro@@ gate contracts with virtually all domestic constitu@@ encies – public employees , pension@@ ers , provin@@ cial governments , and bank de@@ posit@@ ors – in order to meet its obli@@ ga@@ tions to foreign credi@@ tors .
but investors grew increasingly skeptical that the argent@@ ine congress , provin@@ ces , and ordinary people would tolerate the au@@ ster@@ ity policies needed to continue servi@@ cing foreign debt .
as mass prote@@ sts spread , they were proved right .
when globalization colli@@ des with domestic politics , the smart money be@@ ts on the home team .
perhaps there is another path .
consider lat@@ via , which recently found itself experiencing economic difficulties similar to those of argentina a decade ago .
lat@@ via had grown rapidly since joining the european union in 2004 , on the back of large-scale external borrowing and a domestic property bubble .
it had run up a curr@@ ent-@@ account deficit and a foreig@@ n-@@ debt burden that were literally of greek propor@@ tions .
predic@@ tably , the global financial crisis and ab@@ rupt rever@@ sal in capital flows in 2008 left the lat@@ vi@@ an economy in di@@ re stra@@ its .
as len@@ ding and property prices collapsed , unemployment rose to 20 % and gdp declined by 18 % in 2009 .
in january 2009 , the country had its worst riots since the collapse of the soviet union .
lat@@ via had a fixed exchange rate and free capital flows , just like argentina .
its currency has been pe@@ gged to the euro since 2005 .
unlike argentina , however , the country ’ s politicians managed to tough it out without de@@ valu@@ ing the currency and introducing capital controls .
what seems to have changed the balance of political costs and benefits was the prospect of reaching the promised land of event@@ ual mem@@ ber@@ ship in the euro@@ zone , which comp@@ elled lat@@ vi@@ an policymakers to forec@@ lose any options that would en@@ danger that objective .
that , in turn , increased the credi@@ bility of their actions – despite those actions ’ very high economic and political costs .
the economics is not encouraging .
unless the greek economy reco@@ vers , taking on new debt is a temporary pal@@ li@@ ative that will require even more au@@ ster@@ ity down the line .
and , as long as domestic demand remains depressed , structural reforms – priva@@ tization and liber@@ alization of labor markets and professional services – are unlikely to deliver the needed growth .
as the experiences of inter@@ war britain – and , more recently , of argentina and lat@@ via – show , it is the politics that ultimately determines the outcome .
for the greek program to have any chance , the pa@@ p@@ andre@@ o@@ u government must mount a monum@@ ental effort to convince its domestic constitu@@ ents that economic pain is the price they are paying for a bri@@ ghter future – and not just a means to satisfy external credi@@ tors .
will hamas win the peace ?
washington , dc – for generations to come , the palestini@@ ans will remember the horrific war in gaza with pain and bitter@@ ness .
but what cannot yet be seen is how palestini@@ ans will view hamas .
whether hamas can claim a victory – and whether palestini@@ ans will believe them will be determined by the type of ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire that is eventually agreed , if a formal one is eventually agreed .
the end game – for both israel and hamas – is thus cru@@ cially important .
for the moment , hamas is perceived by the majority of palestini@@ ans as the victim of a war intended to gain its sur@@ render .
after all , hamas was democra@@ tically elected , but was forbi@@ dden from rul@@ ing and besie@@ ged in gaza .
at the same time , palestinian president mahmoud ab@@ b@@ as is accused of si@@ ding with israel in order to restore his lost authority in gaza .
the war exposed flaws in hamas ’ judgment .
hamas apparently did not envision a full-@@ scale confron@@ tation with israel when it refused to rene@@ w a six-@@ month tru@@ ce .
with gaza suffering under a l@@ eng@@ thy siege , hamas leader khal@@ id mas@@ hal said that there was no point in a new tru@@ ce , since the old one had “ failed to lift the siege on gaza . ”
other leaders were quot@@ ed as saying that hamas would “ lift the siege by force . ”
if hamas is to survive the war , it must demonstrate that its resistance resulted in a permanent opening of gaza ’ s border cross@@ ings , especially in ra@@ fa@@ h .
for palestini@@ ans , these are signs of victory .
with open borders , hamas would secure its regime in gaza and build its popul@@ arity in the west bank , putting enormous pressure on ab@@ b@@ as , the leader of the ri@@ val fat@@ ah movement , to accept a national unity government on terms set by hamas .
members of fat@@ ah ’ s central committee are already acc@@ using ab@@ b@@ as of supporting israel in the fighting , of wanting to “ return to gaza on an israeli tank . ”
radical groups within fat@@ ah are lean@@ ing toward an open alliance with hamas .
if hamas comes out ahead , ab@@ b@@ as ’ s allies in other palestinian fac@@ tions will press him to accept hamas and islamic jihad within the pl@@ o .
egypt will have to back@@ track on its reje@@ ction of hamas in order to recover its image among the arab@@ s and to reduce ten@@ sions within egyptian society .
pressure to integrate hamas into palestinian politics is also likely in some european capit@@ als , particularly paris and london , where some expressed opposition to isol@@ ating hamas even before the war .
but if israel forces hamas to accept its conditions for border controls and a formal ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire , hamas ’ s image as the guardian of palestinian resistance will be severely damaged .
palestini@@ ans will ask if it was really necessary to fight this war and pay such a high price .
ab@@ b@@ as will be able to argue that he advis@@ ed hamas to rene@@ w the tru@@ ce and to end its missile fire on israeli towns , but that hamas insisted on exposing palestinian civili@@ ans to deva@@ station .
one indic@@ ator to watch for : the length of that ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire .
palestini@@ ans will recognize hamas ’ s acceptance of a multi-@@ year tru@@ ce with israel as a sign of defeat , which would also under@@ score palestinian feelings of humili@@ ation and aband@@ on@@ ment .
he@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h , despite its rhetoric , has taken no steps to support hamas , and the arab states seemed more than willing to support its defeat .
it is in rebuilding gaza that the stakes of the competition will increase .
ab@@ b@@ as , supported by the united states and the european union , may have control over significant funding .
the test for him will be to deliver quickly .
hamas will also have resources for reconstruction .
qatar , a hamas suppor@@ ter , has already announced an investment fund for gaza and contributed $ 250 million .
hamas will have to make a convincing case that gaza ’ s near destruction is a price that had to be paid .
many palestini@@ ans believe that israel in@@ fli@@ cted this damage on gaza to drive a we@@ dge between the people and the “ resistance . ”
there is a prece@@ dent for this argument : he@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h described the destruction of bei@@ rut ’ s southern suburbs in exactly these terms at the end of the lebanon war in july 2006 .
more importantly , hamas can demonstrate that its leaders have been on the front lines during this war , sharing palestinian suffering ; many have been killed , along with their families .
the biggest question is whether the war will alter hamas ’ political goals .
two weeks ago , mus@@ a abu mar@@ z@@ ou@@ k , a senior hamas official , pra@@ ised jimmy carter in the los angeles times as the only american president who had brought true peace in the middle east .
this is a radical de@@ par@@ ture from hamas rhetoric , which has always portra@@ yed the camp david agreement between israel and egypt as a betra@@ yal of the islamic world .
it remains to be seen whether abu mar@@ z@@ ou@@ k ’ s view is merely a tac@@ tic intended to encourage the obama administration to reach out to hamas , or whether the war convinced hamas that the two-@@ state solution is the only viable option to settle the conflict with israel .

philadelphia – us president barack obama called the dow@@ ning of malaysia airlines flight 17 an “ ou@@ trage of un@@ speak@@ able propor@@ tions , ” whereas russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin ter@@ med it an “ accident ” and a “ terrible tragedy . ”
ukra@@ ini@@ an president pe@@ tro po@@ ro@@ sh@@ en@@ ko branded it an “ act of terrorism , ” and malay@@ si@@ an prime minister na@@ ji@@ b ra@@ za@@ k called it an “ in@@ humane , un@@ civili@@ zed , violent , and ir@@ responsible act . ”
all of these descriptions may be accurate , but each carries different rhetor@@ ical weight and legal implications .
the time has come for governments and international organizations to call the attack on m@@ h@@ 17 a probable war crime .
this rhetor@@ ical shift is needed , first and foremost , because fra@@ ming the moral re@@ pre@@ hen@@ si@@ bility of this des@@ pic@@ able act within a common language will help to alig@@ n public perceptions of it .
as it stands , the public narrative in russia and the west diver@@ ges shar@@ ply .
russian media and officials portra@@ y the episode as , at best , a terrible mistake , and , at worst , an american plot to under@@ mine support for the rebel@@ s .
americans and europeans , for their part , increasingly blame russia for possibly equi@@ pping or assi@@ sting the rebel@@ s .
but , by recognizing the dow@@ ning of m@@ h@@ 17 as a war crime , governments may be able to create an opening to reconcile these narratives .
whatever the perpetr@@ ators ’ underlying mo@@ tives , there is no den@@ ying the moral and legal wrong@@ doing that occurred .
calling the offen@@ se by its legal name acknowled@@ ges this , thereby pre@@ emp@@ ting a rhetor@@ ical battle to frame the attack as terror , tragedy , or conspiracy .
even the russians may be willing to accept this fra@@ ming , because it avo@@ ids fing@@ er-@@ pointing against particular actors and affir@@ ms that a court of law – not a series of media statements – will determine what occurred and who is responsible .
in fact , another important reason to characteri@@ ze the dow@@ ning of m@@ h@@ 17 publicly as a war crime is that it may prove beneficial in app@@ re@@ hen@@ ding the perpetr@@ ators .
there is a real danger that those responsible for pressing the launch button – and , perhaps , for or@@ dering the launch – will disappear into the chaos of eastern ukra@@ ine , the vast exp@@ ans@@ es of russia , or elsewhere .
there is also a danger that the perpetr@@ ators , if found , might avoid trial if the local authorities label the crime political , and thus exem@@ pt from normal ex@@ tradition requirements .
all of the relevant states in the region have accepted the legal obligation to ass@@ ist in the investigation and pro@@ secu@@ tion of war crimes .
the obligation to pro@@ sec@@ ute suspected war criminals , or ex@@ tradi@@ te them to face pro@@ secu@@ tion elsewhere , becomes more compelling in accor@@ dance with the seriousness of the alle@@ ged crime .
while the full details of the attack on m@@ h@@ 17 remain unknown , shooting a sur@@ face-@@ to-@@ air missile at a civilian air@@ lin@@ er flying over a war zone is most likely a viol@@ ation of the law of war – by which the ukra@@ ini@@ an government , the russian government , and the rebel@@ s are all bound .
indeed , the conflict in eastern ukra@@ ine constit@@ utes a non-@@ international armed conflict ( a war between a government and rebel movement ) governed by international humanitarian law , which categ@@ or@@ ically b@@ ans the intentional targe@@ ting of civili@@ ans .
in other words , if whoever launched the missile did so with the intent of killing the civilian passengers abo@@ ard m@@ h@@ 17 , the act was un@@ mista@@ k@@ ably a war crime .
even if the objective was to strike a ukra@@ ini@@ an transport aircraft , the act likely constit@@ utes a war crime .
fundamental to the law of war , including the law applic@@ able in non-@@ international armed conflicts , is the principle of distinction – the requirement that fighting parties distinguish between civilian and military targets .
in the words of the international committee of the red cross , that duty of care includes doing “ everything feasi@@ ble to veri@@ fy that targets are military obje@@ ctives . ”
in this case , many steps could easily have been taken to differenti@@ ate m@@ h@@ 17 from a milit@@ ar@@ y-@@ transport plane , including visual identi@@ fication ( perhaps with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars ) , ra@@ dar@@ -@@ signature analysis , and a check of the civilian aircraft trans@@ pon@@ der-@@ code broadcast .
if , as seems likely , these basic steps were not taken , even an accidental strike on m@@ h@@ 17 would constit@@ ute a war crime .
a dutch or malay@@ si@@ an court , or even a special tribun@@ al under the au@@ sp@@ ices of the united nations ( like the one that pro@@ secu@@ ted the 1988 pan am lo@@ cker@@ bie bom@@ bing ) , will ultimately determine who bears legal responsibility for the dow@@ ning of m@@ h@@ 17 .
fra@@ ming the attack as a likely war crime now – as un high commission@@ er for human rights na@@ vi pil@@ lay has done – may help to reconcile the confli@@ cting narratives that are emerging .
and , perhaps more important , doing so can play a key role in se@@ cur@@ ing the political , diplo@@ matic , and legal support needed to bring the perpetr@@ ators to justice .
china ’ s new reforms in theory and practice
hong kong – on november 12 , the third plen@@ ary of the 18th central committee of the chinese communist party ( c@@ cp ) announced a major turn to market@@ -@@ oriented policies : interest@@ -@@ rate and currency liber@@ alization , reform of banks and state enter@@ pris@@ es , clear@@ er land ownership for rural inhabit@@ ants , and a better deal for urban migr@@ ants .
behind this land@@ mark decision was a potential crisis .
china ’ s success has been driven by cheap exports based on cheap labor , infrastructure built by state enter@@ pris@@ es with low-cost bank funding , and government budgets funded by land sales .
but labor is no longer cheap , road construction to connect major cities has given way to building large shopping m@@ alls in small towns , and land sales based on re@@ zon@@ ing are reaching both economic limits and the limits of villa@@ gers ’ tolerance .
cheap money with limited investment out@@ lets now risks fu@@ eling property bubbles and industrial over@@ capacity .
without fundamental change , china faces slower economic growth , inadequate job creation and innovation , and popping bubbles .
the solution is a rapid shift from china ’ s ex@@ port@@ -based growth model to one based on domestic demand ; from infrastructure to consumption ; from the dominance of large state-@@ owned enter@@ pris@@ es ( so@@ es ) to that of small and medi@@ um-@@ size private enter@@ pris@@ es ; from industry to services ; and , more broadly , from bureau@@ cratic control to market control .
all successful asian countries have made this shift ; south korea and taiwan are models .
but rapid change ent@@ a@@ ils immense pain .
so@@ es will lose their low-@@ interest loans , subsidi@@ zed land , monopoly protection , and privileged housing .
party and state bureau@@ cra@@ cies will lose power ( and income ) .
local governments are particularly desperate . they have huge deb@@ ts , which they amor@@ tize by re@@ zon@@ ing and selling land .
already squee@@ zed by ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ant property prices and popular resistance to land ta@@ kings , they now face higher interest rates , property taxes , villa@@ gers empowered by stronger rights , and expensive new requirements to provide social services to migr@@ ants .
the desperation of local po@@ tent@@ ates and so@@ e execu@@ tives has created powerful resistance to reform .
at a plen@@ ary repor@@ tedly marked by ac@@ ri@@ mon@@ y , china ’ s political leaders si@@ ded with reform .
as one economic plan@@ ner said , when asked about resistance before the decisi@@ ve meeting , “ in the end , all of our leaders understand numbers .
the implications of the numbers are clear . ”
the third plen@@ um ’ s announcement of its decisions took the form of a statement of broad principles , leaving many obser@@ vers concerned by the lack of detail .
but the c@@ cp ’ s role is to set the direction of policy ; execu@@ ting the party ’ s decisions is the government ’ s job .
and the plen@@ um did establish a top-@@ level group to coordinate and en@@ force imple@@ mentation of its decisions .
while imple@@ mentation will be a long struggle , with occasionally fier@@ ce resistance , key reforms are already underway .
the current 12th five-@@ year plan calls for annual wage increases to average at least 13@@ .@@ 4 % ; this year , wages are rising at an average rate of 18 % , which will squeeze out industries characterized by ob@@ sol@@ es@@ cence or over@@ capacity .
moreover , the government ’ s anti-@@ corruption campaign is targe@@ ting some of the most powerful industry groups , such as the petro@@ leum faction , thereby weak@@ ening their resistance to reform .
most important , economic outcomes are becoming increasingly alig@@ ned with the authorities ’ goals .
services already account for more output and employment than industry – the internet company ali@@ bab@@ a , for example , is empowering both consumers and smaller companies on a previously unimaginable scale – and recent growth has been driven by domestic demand rather than net exports .
reform is not just a plan ; it is already happening .
economic open@@ ings to central asia and to as@@ ean ( specifically to vietnam ) are well underway , and reform will include further international opening .
the third plen@@ um ’ s decisions follow the launch in september of the shanghai free-@@ trade zone , which will open new sectors to foreign investment and per@@ mit largely market@@ -based financial trans@@ actions and capital flows .
the liber@@ alization of capital flows is intended to be a gradu@@ al national policy , channel@@ ed through trusted institutions in shanghai .
for trade in goods , the new free-@@ trade zone is intended to compete directly with singapore and hong kong .
china fears dependence on those entre@@ p@@ ô@@ ts in the event of conflict .
for foreign investors , the policy will be to expand greatly the range of opportunities while cur@@ ta@@ iling foreign control ; foreign companies , for example , may hold minority stakes in the tele@@ com@@ s sector , while dominant foreign companies like mon@@ san@@ to will face constraints .
president x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping faces the politically risky task of pushing the c@@ cp ’ s reform agenda against fier@@ ce opposition while the economy slo@@ ws .
by emphasi@@ zing party control – through a cra@@ ck@@ down on so@@ es , government oppon@@ ents , and cri@@ tics in the media and academia – x@@ i see@@ ks to maximize his ability to impose economic reforms while mini@@ mi@@ zing the risk of a challenge from conservative forces .
above all , he is determined to avoid the fate of previous chinese leaders like hu ya@@ ob@@ ang and z@@ ha@@ o zi@@ yang , who lost their jobs after a critical mass of their oppon@@ ents came to believe that economic and political reform je@@ opar@@ di@@ zed party control .
so , at least for now , china will focus on another great wave of economic reform , whereas political reform will mostly be limited to re@@ organization of government agencies to boost efficiency and streng@@ then efforts to reduce corruption .
( there have been some steps toward reform , including a decision to remove judges from local political control . )
and yet china will find it increasingly difficult to post@@ pone stronger measures that would appe@@ ase popular demands for fairness , including the establishment of an independent ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary , which could prove to be no less an imperative than structural economic reforms .
likewise , the leaders must either accept much of the information revolution ’ s sw@@ am@@ ping of controls or engage in far more costly repres@@ sion .
hopes for political reform rest on the possibility that x@@ i ’ s second term will see the acc@@ ession to top leadership of re@@ formers like poli@@ t@@ bur@@ o member wan@@ g yang and vice president li yu@@ an@@ cha@@ o .
for now , however , china will focus on another great wave of economic reform .
hong kong – before china ’ s leadership transition earlier this year , experts said that the chinese communist party was intent on preventing a lar@@ ger-@@ than@@ -@@ life personality from assuming power .
the c@@ cp , it was argued , wanted someone more like the bureau@@ cratic out@@ going leader , hu j@@ inta@@ o , rather than a charis@@ matic success@@ or like , say , the former ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing provin@@ cial governor bo x@@ il@@ ai .
yet the new president and c@@ cp leader , x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping , is hardly dul@@ l .
he began his term by paying ho@@ mage to deng xia@@ oping at his statue in sh@@ enz@@ hen , where , more than three decades ago , the former communist party leader had launched the campaign to convert a reluctant party to free-@@ market reforms .
in a top-@@ level november meeting , x@@ i set out the details of a fundamental change in economic direction , over@@ sha@@ do@@ wing his colleagues .
x@@ i now leads a new economic group that will coordinate and impose his reforms on frac@@ tious colleagues .
and , unlike hu , he immediately became head of the military and now runs a parallel national security council .
at first gl@@ ance , a new “ par@@ amount leader ” appears to be emerging .
recent history explains this re-@@ concentration of power .
in 1993 , centr@@ al-@@ government leaders enjoyed relatively limited powers : they did not control the money supply and had difficulty firing provin@@ cial gover@@ nor@@ s or reloc@@ ating top gener@@ als .
central government revenue was low ; indeed , proportion@@ ately smaller than that of central governments in any other major economy .
this changed when th@@ en-@@ party leader ji@@ ang z@@ em@@ in and his prime minister , z@@ hu ron@@ g@@ ji , centralized authority in order to sta@@ ve off economic crisis at a time of growing risk to china ’ s banks .
in the process , the labor force of china ’ s state enter@@ pris@@ es declined by 50 million , china lost 25 million manufacturing jobs , and centr@@ al-@@ government employment was slas@@ hed .
these measures saved china ’ s economy , but at the price of widespread social stress , which made z@@ hu widely dis@@ liked when he left office .
popular reaction against the co@@ smo@@ poli@@ tan , coastal , and market@@ -@@ oriented reforms of z@@ hu and ji@@ ang brought to power leaders whose forma@@ tive experiences were in the in@@ land provin@@ ces of gan@@ s@@ u and tibet .
riding a wave of res@@ ent@@ ment against inequality and social ten@@ sions , hu and his prime minister , wen ji@@ ab@@ ao , promised a “ harmon@@ i@@ ous society , ” without the stres@@ ses of z@@ hu ’ s agenda .
they slowed economic reform and ceased political reforms .
the bureaucracy expanded from 40 million to 70 million , and power de@@ vol@@ ved to provin@@ ces , bureau@@ cra@@ cies , and state-@@ owned enter@@ pris@@ es ( so@@ es ) .
the som@@ n@@ ol@@ ent hu / wen era , fortunately , did not dam@@ pen the economic growth triggered by the earlier reforms under@@ taken by ji@@ ang and z@@ hu .
but the econom@@ ic@@ -@@ growth model that those reforms created was running out of steam .
low-cost exports were struggling as labor costs rose .
investment in infrastructure was shifting from grow@@ th-@@ enhan@@ cing projects , such as inter-@@ city highways , to less productive shopping m@@ alls in secon@@ d@@ - and third-@@ tier cities .
productivity plum@@ me@@ ted in so@@ es , whose privileged access to finan@@ cing crowded out privat@@ e-@@ sector investment .
lo@@ cal@@ -@@ government funding , through the sei@@ z@@ ure and res@@ ale of property , was reaching its limits .
thus , it became essential to launch a new wave of far-@@ reaching reforms , including liber@@ alization of interest rates , se@@ curi@@ ties markets , and foreig@@ n-@@ exchange controls , in order to fund the more productive private sector and reduce excess capacity in so@@ es .
in particular , the reforms were needed to def@@ late an emerging property bubble resul@@ ting from huge savings and foreign capital in@@ flows that had no other profitable investment out@@ let .
the government planned to liber@@ alize interest rates and the capital account to encourage investment in modern , high-@@ value industries , rather than continue to subsidi@@ ze low-@@ value exports .
it started to shift the economy ’ s base from ex@@ port-@@ oriented industries to domestic growth , and from manufacturing to services .
and it announced its intention to slow local governments ’ sei@@ zur@@ es of farm@@ land and exc@@ essive borrowing through cap@@ tive enter@@ pris@@ es .
so@@ es were determined to defend their privile@@ ges .
highly lever@@ aged local governments could not tolerate higher interest rates or an appreci@@ ating currency , and they were ad@@ am@@ ant about continuing land sales and op@@ posing property taxes .
they fe@@ ared the financial burden of new requirements to provide social services to urban migr@@ ants .
as a result , a new , lean leadership team had to be mobili@@ zed .
the number of top leaders was cut from nine to seven .
the new line@@ up eliminated the most powerful voice on the left ( bo ) and rele@@ gated the “ extreme re@@ formers ” on the right ( li yu@@ an@@ cha@@ o and wan@@ g yang ) to the second tier .
to reduce elders ’ interference , hu stepped down as head of the military and ji@@ ang z@@ em@@ in promised to step back .
moreover , a leading economic group was established to en@@ force bureau@@ cratic compli@@ ance , as was a national security council ( similar to that in the united states ) to coordinate foreign policy .
previously , the military often kept the foreign ministry in the dark ; and the party ’ s foreig@@ n-@@ affairs office , which hand@@ led north korea , often failed to coordinate its activities with the foreign ministry , which hand@@ led south korea .
an anti-@@ corruption campaign weak@@ ened opposition , and z@@ hu re-@@ emerged as a hero .
this set the stage for x@@ i ’ s arri@@ val .
in short , the new@@ -@@ style leadership , a form of managed charis@@ ma , was collectively designed to serve national needs .
and it impli@@ es that x@@ i is unlikely to emerge as par@@ amount leader .
the chinese pres@@ iden@@ cy ’ s authority has certainly increased ; but x@@ i is powerful only when he has the votes .
on con@@ ten@@ tious issues , he has but one of seven .
desperate women ’ s dangerous moves
gen@@ eva – one of the most significant recent trends in migration has been the rise in the number of women using dangerous rou@@ tes previously used mainly by men .
more and more women – fle@@ eing discrimin@@ ation , violence , or poverty – are now taking the same risks as men in search of a better life for themselves and their children .
this is desperation migration .
indeed , while many women travel with their families , the international organization for migration ( i@@ om ) is seeing an increasing number of women migr@@ ating on their own to an unknown , unpredictable , and often dangerous future .
women and children migr@@ ants are dying with increasing frequency at sea , crossing deserts , and on other ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous rou@@ tes .
what has changed ?
among the many factors pushing women to migrate are pervasive gender bias and social preju@@ di@@ ces against single mothers or wi@@ dows in their country of origin .
but poverty is almost always the strongest force driving women to leave .
in most poor countries , women are poorer than men , o@@ wing to the systematic discrimin@@ ation that they face in education , health care , employment , and control of assets .
of course , most migr@@ ant women do not encounter mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment or die on their jour@@ neys ; in fact , many deri@@ ve real benefits from migration .
but , among the world ’ s estimated 1@@ 11 million migr@@ ant women ( half the total ) , violence and abuse can occur at any time , starting from the very out@@ set of the migration process .
throughout the migration cycle , women are more at risk from physical violence by fellow migr@@ ants , smug@@ gl@@ ers , and state officers , and can be forced to exchange sex for transportation , food , or accommo@@ dation .
uns@@ ur@@ pris@@ ingly , migr@@ ant women are often victims of human trafficking , finding themselves en@@ sla@@ ved as labor@@ ers , prostit@@ utes , or participants in organized beg@@ ging operations .
this is true regardless of why women migrate .
when women run for their lives because of natural or man-made disasters , gen@@ der-@@ based violence is one of the great risks they face .
displaced women , often dest@@ it@@ ute , are easy prey for criminals .
this was one of my immediate concerns when typ@@ ho@@ on hai@@ yan struck the philippines , and at my request a special program was institu@@ ted to alert and help women in per@@ il .
even when women migr@@ ants find a job in a host country , it is rarely easy for them .
they are pre@@ domin@@ antly employed in domestic work , car@@ e-@@ giving , agriculture , and entertainment – all low-@@ paid , largely un@@ regulated sectors that are rarely covered by national labor laws .
they are often subject to pun@@ ish@@ ingly long working hours , non-@@ payment of wages , forced con@@ fin@@ ement , starvation , beating , sexual abuse , and threats and intimi@@ dation .
many women migr@@ ants are uns@@ killed or un@@ documented domestic workers .
this makes them more vulnerable to violence , because they typically depend on a single emplo@@ yer and in many countries face de@@ por@@ tation if they attempt to change jobs .
moreover , social integration in a new country can be more difficult for women than for men .
this is partly because women are often subject to harmful traditional practices , such as early and forced marriage , female gen@@ ital muti@@ lation , and so-called “ honor ” crimes , en@@ forced by families who want to maintain a link with their country of origin .
and it is especially difficult for women migr@@ ants to navigate between the tan@@ tali@@ zing freedom of choice and expression in their host society and the traditional roles expected of them at home .
the rising number of migr@@ ant deaths – both women and men – at sea and in deserts is a wa@@ ke@@ -up call for the international community to act .
i@@ om has called on all relevant actors – including countries of origin , transit countries , and destination countries – to address the p@@ light of migr@@ ants attemp@@ ting life-@@ threatening jour@@ neys and find solutions .
protecting women migr@@ ants – often the most desperate of the desperate – should top their priorities .
in 20@@ 14 , the international community will review the united nations millennium development goals , which ex@@ pi@@ re next year , and decide on a post-@@ 2015 development agenda .
i@@ om believes that migr@@ ants , and in particular women migr@@ ants , who in the past have been largely invisible in the language of development , must be a part of this .
we must no longer ignore half the world ’ s migr@@ ants .
like all migr@@ ants , women on the move are entitled to personal security and basic dignity .
will nato ’ s pro@@ dig@@ al son return ?
paris -- few state vis@@ its have lasting results .
ni@@ col@@ as sar@@ ko@@ zy ’ s just completed trip to washington may be an exception , because the french president may be preparing to bring nato a highly valued present for its 60@@ th anniversary in the spring of 2009 : france ’ s return to nato ’ s integrated military structure , from which charles de gau@@ lle with@@ drew in 1966 .
in retro@@ spect , de gau@@ lle ’ s decision proved to be much more de@@ tri@@ mental for france than for the alliance .
by with@@ drawing from nato ’ s integrated military command , france exclu@@ ded itself from political decision-making within the alliance and thus became the equivalent of the “ har@@ kis ” – the local soldiers who served with the french army during the al@@ geri@@ an war : fine soldiers , but with virtually no reward for their service .
how realistic is the possibility of scenario french return to nato ’ s military fold ?
historically , abor@@ ted moves and fau@@ x pas abo@@ und on both sides in the french / nato relationship , the latest being jacques chi@@ ra@@ c ’ s failed attempt to patch up france ’ s relations with nato upon his arri@@ val in power in 1995 .
success is not guaranteed this time , either , but the chances are much higher now , because france , the united states , and the world have changed .
for star@@ ters , the us now has a real friend and ally in the é@@ ly@@ s@@ é@@ e palace .
to speak of sar@@ ko@@ zy as a substitute for tony blair in europe would be premature – and un@@ helpful , given blair ’ s inability to ex@@ ert significant influence on us policy .
but sar@@ ko@@ zy is both eager to transform france ’ s relations with the alliance and has a strategy to do so .
moreover , the french army supports such a move , while only a small segment of the foreign ministry is opposed .
sar@@ ko@@ zy ’ s strategy is to link progress in building a common european defense and security structure with a re@@ definition of nato .
more europe in security terms means more alliance .
so , because sar@@ ko@@ zy wants to be seen as a convinced european , he must norm@@ alize france ’ s relations with a new alliance based on two pillars – european and american .
moreover , financial and human resources for military affairs are scarce and cannot be du@@ plic@@ ated , while france and britain want to re@@ start the sa@@ in@@ t-@@ mal@@ o process of bil@@ ateral defense efforts launched nearly ten years ago .
as a result , for the sake of europe , france must move closer to the alliance .
sar@@ ko@@ zy has also fully integrated into france ’ s approach to europe a reck@@ oning with the new balance of power within the european union following the acc@@ ession of eastern european states .
unlike chi@@ ra@@ c , he understands that it is counter@@ productive and un@@ realistic to ask countries like bulg@@ aria or roman@@ ia to choose between their european or atlantic loy@@ alties .
here , again , streng@@ th@@ ening europe requires streng@@ th@@ ening the alliance .
sar@@ ko@@ zy ’ s approach may work , because america , too , has changed .
in american eyes , the kosovo war in 1999 demonstrated nato ’ s gl@@ aring and myri@@ ad short@@ com@@ ings , while the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , moved america still further away from the alliance , particularly after president george w. bush dispar@@ ag@@ ingly rejected nato ’ s offer of help .
former secretary of defense don@@ ald rum@@ s@@ feld even tried to use di@@ vide@@ -and-@@ rule tactics by pit@@ ting “ new ” europe against the “ old ” europe led by france and germany , which opposed the iraq war .
those di@@ visions are now history , and american reser@@ vations about a european security pill@@ ar cannot trum@@ p america ’ s pressing needs for al@@ lied support .
confronted with disaster in iraq , the risk of afghanistan following iraq into chaos , and the escal@@ ating crisis with iran , the us can no longer treat the nato allies with dis@@ da@@ in .
although europe remains milit@@ arily weak , america ’ s power is now in doubt .
if a european pill@@ ar within nato is needed to streng@@ then the alliance , why not accept it ?
beyond the changes in france and the us , the decisi@@ ve factor behind the possible rein@@ vention of nato is the transformation of the international system itself .
aside from the explo@@ sive situation in the middle east and the threat of islam@@ ist terrorism , the west is now confronted with the rise of asia , the return of a more asser@@ tive russia , and new energy and environmental challenges .
both france and america have a key role to play in addressing these issues effectively .
sar@@ ko@@ zy ’ s trip to washington , and his address to a recep@@ tive us congress , was one more step toward en@@ suring that they do so together .
will next time be different ?
chicago – carmen rein@@ hart and kenne@@ th ro@@ go@@ ff , in their excellent , e@@ pon@@ y@@ mous book on debt crises , argue that the most dangerous words in any language are “ this time is different . ” perhaps the next most dangerous words are “ next time will be different . ”
these words are often utter@@ ed when politicians and central banks want to ba@@ il out some troubled segment of the economy . “ yes , ” one can almost hear them saying , “ we understand that ba@@ iling out banks will sub@@ ver@@ t market discipline .
but you cannot expect us to stand by and watch the system collapse , causing millions of innocent people to suffer .
we have to live with the hand we are dealt .
but next time will be different . ” they then use every tool they have to prevent economic losses on their watch .
the government ’ s incentives are clear .
the public rewards them for dealing with the problem at hand – whether building le@@ ve@@ es to protect houses built on a flood plain or rescu@@ ing banks that have dod@@ gy se@@ curi@@ ties on their balance sheets .
politicians and central bankers gain little by letting the gree@@ dy or car@@ eless face the full consequences of their actions , for many innocent people would suffer as well .
a sym@@ pathetic press would ampli@@ fy their hear@@ t-@@ ren@@ ding stories of lost jobs and homes , making those counsel@@ ing against intervention appear call@@ ous .
democracies are necessarily soft@@ -@@ hear@@ ted , whereas markets and nature are not ; government inevitably expands to fill the gap .
to the extent that the rough justice me@@ ted out by markets or nature teaches anyone to behave better , it has consequences far beyond the horizon of anyone in power today .
when asked to choose between the risk of being known to po@@ ster@@ ity as the central banker who let the system collapse and the intangible future benefits of teaching risk ta@@ kers a lesson , it does not take genius to predict the central banker ’ s decision .
democracy tends to institution@@ alize moral hazard in sectors that are economically or politically important , such as finance or real estate , allowing them to priva@@ tize gains and soci@@ alize losses .
even though the authorities insist that the next time will be different , everyone knows that they will make the same decision when confronted with the same choice again .
so , knowing that next time will not be different , the authorities try their best to prevent a “ next time . ”
but risk ta@@ kers have every incentive to try their luck again , knowing that , at worst , they will be ba@@ iled out .
in this cat@@ -and-@@ mouse game , risk ta@@ kers have the upper hand .
for one thing , risk ta@@ kers are typically small , co@@ h@@ esive interest groups that , once rescued , have a powerful incentive , as well as the resources , to buy the political influence needed to ensure a return to the status quo ante .
if risk ta@@ kers were allowed to face more serious losses , they would have fewer resources to fight political attempts to constra@@ in their risky activities .
moreover , the public does not have a long memory , a long time horizon , or an appeti@@ te for detail .
even as the united states ’ vol@@ umin@@ ous dod@@ d-@@ frank bill tried to ensure that bankers never subje@@ cted american taxpa@@ yers to un@@ due risk again , public attention had moved on to the state of the real economy and unemployment .
why focus on financial regulation when the risks of an immediate collapse are small , and when the details are so te@@ dious ?
as technical experts and lobby@@ ists took over , and the public lost interest , dod@@ d-@@ frank became friend@@ lier and friend@@ lier to the banks .
so how can this one-@@ way be@@ tting be stopped ?
the scary answer may be that it does not end until governments run out of money ( as in ireland ) or the public runs out of sympathy ( as in germany vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis the rest of europe ) .
to avoid that fate , governments should start by recognizing that the system is programmed to respond to deep distress , and that they can do nothing about it .
but they must try to ensure that they do not destroy incentives by doing too much .
and they must off@@ set the distor@@ tions created by intervention in other ways .
for example , the us federal reserve has essentially guaranteed the financial sector that if it gets into trouble , ultra-@@ low interest rates will be main@@ tained ( at the expense of sa@@ vers ) until the sector reco@@ vers .
in the early to mid-@@ 1990 ’ s , rates were kept low because of banks ’ real-@@ estate problems .
they were slas@@ hed again in 2001 and kept ultra-@@ low after the dot@@ -@@ com bust .
and they have been ultra-@@ low since 2008 .
senior fed policymakers deny that their interest@@ -@@ rate policy bears any responsibility for risk taking , but there is much evidence to the contrary .
it would be difficult for the fed to respond differently if the financial sector gets into trouble again .
but it does not have to maintain ultra-@@ low interest rates after the crisis has passed , especially if those rates have little impact on generating sustainable economic activity .
doing so merely rewards banks for their past ex@@ cess@@ es – and taxes sa@@ vers .
more importantly , if the fed wants to restore incentives for risk ta@@ kers and sa@@ vers , it should off@@ set the effects of staying “ low for long ” in bad times by increasing interest rates more rapidly than is strictly necessary as the economy reco@@ vers .
this will , of course , be politically difficult , because the public has been programmed to think that ultra-@@ low rates are good , and higher rates bad , for growth , without any consideration for the long-term sustainability of growth .
finally , the pressure on governments to intervene would be lower if individuals had access to a minimum safety net .
official us policy is so activist in down@@ turns ( regardless of its effectiveness ) partly because unemployment is so costly to workers – who have little savings , unemployment benefits that run out quickly , and health care that is often tied to a job .

will ol@@ m@@ ert survive ?
after israel ’ s inability last summer to achieve a conclu@@ sive victory over he@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h in southern lebanon , public pressure forced prime minister e@@ hu@@ d ol@@ m@@ ert ’ s government to ap@@ point a commission to examine the causes of this surprising failure .
how could a small mili@@ tia , num@@ ber@@ ing less than a few thousand com@@ bat@@ ants , survive the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the middle east ’ s most for@@ mid@@ able military machine ?
the commission , headed by retired supreme court judge eli@@ y@@ ah@@ u win@@ ogra@@ d , has just published its inter@@ im report .
its criticism of ol@@ m@@ ert , defense minister am@@ ir per@@ etz , and chie@@ f-@@ of-@@ staff dan hal@@ u@@ tz – set forth in a detailed and me@@ ticul@@ ous 1@@ 17@@ -@@ page assessment – is harsh , but not surprising .
the win@@ ogra@@ d commission artic@@ ulated what most israelis already think : ol@@ m@@ ert and per@@ etz lac@@ ked the military , security , and policy experience to confront a terrorist organization that ra@@ i@@ ded israeli territory , killed a number of soldiers and kidna@@ pped two , and then launched thousands of rockets on civilian targets for over a month .
indeed , the in@@ experience of the prime minister and the defense minister are unprecedented in israel ’ s history .
ol@@ m@@ ert , who stepped into ar@@ iel shar@@ on ’ s shoes as leader of the new ka@@ di@@ ma party , was considered a competent but lac@@ klu@@ ster parli@@ am@@ ent@@ arian – and later mayor of jerusalem – who was known more for his po@@ le@@ mi@@ cal style than for his political stat@@ ure or gravi@@ tas .
for most israelis , even those who voted for him as the be@@ ar@@ er of shar@@ on ’ s legacy after the gaza dis@@ engagement , ol@@ m@@ ert thus remained the accidental prime minister .
likewise , per@@ etz , a rab@@ ble-@@ r@@ ous@@ ing but effective trade uni@@ onist , surprised all when he won the labor party ’ s leadership primary and then chose the defense portfolio over the treas@@ ury .
to many , the du@@ o of ol@@ m@@ ert and per@@ etz seemed to invite trouble .
precisely because israelis are aware of the constant security threat facing their country , they have always believed that their leaders should be able to lead israel in war – but also to ask the military tough questions when diplomacy may fail .
when such a moment arrived , totally out of the blue ( or so it seemed ) with he@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h ’ s raid on july 12 , 2006 , israel ’ s two top politicians were completely out of their depth , stum@@ bling into a war for which neither they nor the israeli army were prepared .
the military was led – for the first time in its history – by an air force general , dan hal@@ u@@ tz , who believed that everything could be solved by air power , creating a com@@ bu@@ sti@@ ble combination of civilian ignorance and military arrogan@@ ce .
in measured but devastating pro@@ se , the win@@ ogra@@ d commission gives failing marks to all three leaders .
per@@ etz was unable to g@@ auge the strategic implications of his decisions .
and hal@@ u@@ tz failed to present the civilian leadership with the full pan@@ op@@ ly of military options at the army ’ s disposal .
hal@@ u@@ tz already res@@ ig@@ ned a few months ago .
but both ol@@ m@@ ert and per@@ etz have declared that , despite the commission ’ s conclusions , they would not quit : instead , they have vo@@ wed to implement the report ’ s many far-@@ reaching substan@@ tive recommen@@ dations about policy , strategy , and decision-making processes .
will ol@@ m@@ ert and per@@ etz be able to stay on ?
their coalition government enjo@@ ys a comfortable parli@@ am@@ entary majority ; nor does the political arithmetic imp@@ ly a viable parli@@ am@@ entary alternative .
but public opinion – vola@@ tile and angry – calls for both to res@@ ign : a publi@@ c-@@ opinion poll conducted after the commission published its report indicated that only 14 % of israelis believe that ol@@ m@@ ert should keep his job , while less than 11 % support per@@ etz .
later this week , demon@@ strations calling for the government &apos;s res@@ ig@@ nation are planned , and it will become obviously more difficult for the government to continue to function .
there are already ru@@ mor@@ s about a palace coup within ka@@ di@@ ma , aimed at replacing ol@@ m@@ ert with either the de@@ pu@@ ty prime minister , the veteran shi@@ mon per@@ es , or the popular foreign minister , tz@@ i@@ pi li@@ v@@ ni .
but it does not appear that ol@@ m@@ ert will allow himself to be pushed out .
in fact , ol@@ m@@ ert ’ s weak and dis@@ credi@@ ted government may yet survive .
if the government were to fall and new elections held , there are strong indi@@ cations that the winner might be bin@@ yam@@ in net@@ any@@ ah@@ u , of the right-@@ wing li@@ ku@@ d , which was deci@@ mated in the 2006 elections , but is now pati@@ ently waiting in the wings .
many who want ol@@ m@@ ert to go would still not welcome a net@@ any@@ ah@@ u come@@ back , which may also explain what appears to be an indi@@ rect end@@ or@@ se@@ ment of ol@@ m@@ ert by the united states .
only a strong israeli government can make the painful decisions necessary for negotiations with the palestini@@ ans to succeed .
as a result , the pro@@ spe@@ cts for meaningful continu@@ ation of israeli@@ -@@ palestinian talks look even di@@ mmer than they did before .
indeed , the real loser of the 2006 lebanon war was neither israel nor he@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h , but , at least for the time being , the peace process .
will rising interest rates tor@@ pe@@ do stock and house prices ?
interest rates around the world are pois@@ ed to rise .
short-term rates have gone so low since the worldwide recession of 2001 - 1 % and 2 % , respe@@ ctively , in the united states and the euro@@ zone , and practically zero in japan - that a streng@@ th@@ ening world economy will force central banks to ti@@ gh@@ ten the mon@@ etary r@@ eins .
australia &apos;s central bank has already been raising rates since may 2002 , and great britain &apos;s since november 2003 .
in the us , the two-@@ day federal open market committee meeting on june 29@@ -@@ 30 is likely to mark a major turning point , rever@@ sing the steady decline of the bench@@ mark federal funds rate since alan green@@ span began loo@@ sen@@ ing mon@@ etary policy in 2001 .
given the tendency of central banks to change interest rates gradually , any change of direction likely means more changes in the same direction later .
what will this land@@ mark change mean for prices of such assets as stocks and homes ?
in theory , when interest rates go up , there is reason to believe that asset prices will go down .
the higher interest rates go , the better are investments in bonds , which compete with investments in other assets such as stocks or homes .
higher interest rates also raise the cost of borrowing to buy these assets , which may dimin@@ ish demand for them , exer@@ ting down@@ ward pressure on their prices .
when interest rates fall , the opposite effect on asset prices may be predicted .
in fact , the history of the stock market &apos;s reactions to changing interest rates is mixed .
sometimes interest rate changes have the predicted effect , sometimes they don &apos;t .
for example , the nas@@ da@@ q stock price index made a spectacular 14 % jump up@@ wards on the day ( january 3 , 2001 ) when america &apos;s fed began its latest series of interest rate cuts . a jump in the market is what one might have expected .
but then the nas@@ da@@ q index fell 22 % over the following year , although the fed continued to cut interest rates aggressi@@ vely .
does that experience suggest that the nas@@ da@@ q index will drop shar@@ ply if the fed raises interest rates on june 30 ?
the timing of the 2001 rate decrease stun@@ ned the market .
by contrast , the fed is widely expected to raise rates at the end this month , so there will be no surprise element .
the market may know , not just from the experience of 200@@ 1-@@ 2 , that interest rate movements do not have predictable effects on stock prices .
but , there are reasons to believe that higher interest rates , even though expected , can have a negative impact on home prices .
that is because home bu@@ yers are mostly ordinary people with little financial sophistication , unlike the professionals who trade in stocks .
un@@ trained people with other things on their minds can make serious economic errors .
home values have so@@ ared to high levels in many countries as irrational exu@@ ber@@ ance gri@@ ps the markets .
high home prices are already putting great stress on many families , which are struggling to make their mortgage payments .
when interest rates go up , these payments will ( when the rate is variable ) also go up , possibly becoming unsustainable .
if one bor@@ rows the equivalent of three years &apos; income to buy a house , a mortgage rate of 6 % means that 18 % of one &apos;s income goes to interest payments , which may be toler@@ able .
but if the rate rises to 8 % , mortgage interest payments rise to 24 % , which , together with amor@@ tization , taxes , other deb@@ ts , and necessary expen@@ di@@ tures , may claim too much of the family budget .
some will then try to sell their over@@ pri@@ ced homes , and the resul@@ ting market imbalance will cause prices to fall .
people with fix@@ ed-@@ rate mort@@ g@@ ages are also vulnerable to rate increases , though less directly .
this is because if they have to move and sell their house , there may be no bu@@ yers who can afford higher interest payments , unless the home &apos;s price also falls .
by contrast , sophisticated investors , such as big stock market players , are unlikely to fall prey to this trap .
but home@@ bu@@ yers are not as sav@@ vy , so they may not see the change coming or they may fail to plan for it .
as psychologists have shown , people are susceptible to &quot; wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking bias , &quot; wi@@ shing away possible future problems that they would rather not think about .
they may over@@ emphasize the likelihood of economic success ( &quot; i will be making a lot more money in a few years &quot; ) and under@@ emphasize the common@@ place problems that regularly challenge family budgets ( &quot; i will be losing my job or getting a divorce &quot; ) .
this bli@@ the attitude is ultimately behind real estate bubbles where they are occurring .
low interest rates did not cause the bubbles . they only made it easier for people , in those areas of the world where there is a half-@@ belie@@ vable story about a fabulous future economy , to indul@@ ge their fantas@@ ies .
interest rate increases will deliver a fresh dose of reality : the interest expense of ow@@ ning a home is going to claim a larger share of family budgets , a hard fact that will eventually sink into our thinking .
but dec@@ lines in home prices will not occur quickly when central banks begin to raise interest rates .
after two years of rate increases , australia &apos;s home price boom only recently shows signs of ab@@ ating .
dominated by amateur investors , home markets do not turn on a di@@ me .
in places where home prices have been rising rapidly , the upward trend may continue or level off for a while .
in most high-@@ pri@@ ced places , a real decline may not come for some time .
will russia save the west ?
moscow – rapid changes in the global economy and international politics are raising , once more , an eternal issue in russia : the country ’ s relations with europe , and with the euro@@ -@@ atlantic region as a whole . of course , russia partly belongs to this region .
russians , on the other hand , emphasize their “ hard power , ” including military force , because they know that they live in a dangerous world and have no one to hide behind . and , because of the country ’ s compar@@ ative lack of “ soft power ” – social , cultural , and economic attra@@ c@@ tiveness – it stands ready to use the competitive advantages ( i.@@ e. , its resource wealth ) available to it .
internal political developments in russia are also pushing the country in a different direction from the west . quite simply , russia is moving away from democracy .
nato expansion is nothing more than the extension of its zone of influence – and in the most sensitive , milit@@ ar@@ y-@@ political sphere . and yet the west ’ s un@@ willingness to abandon that effort is coupled with a repeated ref@@ us@@ al to recognize russia ’ s right to have its own zone of interest .
so nato expansion has left the cold war unfinished . the ideological and military confron@@ tation that under@@ lay it is gone , but the geo@@ political ri@@ val@@ ry that it ent@@ a@@ iled has returned to the fore .
non-@@ russian europe should thank the al@@ mighty for the presence of energy-@@ rich russia at its borders , while russia should be thank@@ ful for having such wealthy customers . but the natural differences in the interests of energy consumers and producers have been given a political / security twist – witness the discussions about an “ energy nato . ”
the united states also loses . without russia , which will remain the world ’ s third strongest power for the fores@@ ee@@ able future , it is impossible to solve the key problems of international security .
that union should be based on a common human , economic , and energy space . the combination of a new security arrangement for the euro@@ -@@ atlantic community and the establishment of the union of europe could arrest the decline in the international weight of the west .
rio de jan@@ ei@@ ro – brazil has been making international headlines of late , but not for traditional stories about urban violence , natural cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es , political corruption , or deforestation in the amazon .
at the g-@@ 20 summit in london last april , for example , us president barack obama called for the world to pay he@@ ed to brazilian president lu@@ i@@ z in@@ á@@ ci@@ o l@@ ula da sil@@ va , the “ most popular politician on earth , ” and shook hands with him , saying : “ my man right here .
in september , the ou@@ sted president of hon@@ dur@@ as , manuel zel@@ aya , re@@ appeared in the country inside the brazilian embassy in te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa after three months of exi@@ le .
although his presence dramatically fu@@ elled the situation for a time , brazilian diplo@@ mats , working with the us , were able to reach agreement with hon@@ dur@@ an authorities to allow manuel zel@@ aya to return to office .
then came the news that brazil will host the 20@@ 16 summer olympic games – this coming on top of ho@@ sting the 20@@ 14 world cup .
as for the global – and fortunately now ab@@ ating – economic crisis , brazil has sh@@ ined throughout , recording a fast and strong recovery . and , as if this good news were not enough , brazil ’ s giant state oil company , petro@@ br@@ á@@ s , is already at work developing two huge deep-@@ water oil fields discovered in the sea off the coast of rio de jan@@ ei@@ ro .
for these and other reasons , brazil is gaining the world ’ s attention .
brazilian democracy , at long last , is working well , following many years of military government , and its economy seems more robust than ever .
as a result , many people are enthusiast@@ ically pointing to an increased international role for brazil in the future .
but two connected and major challenges lie ahead for brazil and its government : the need to build a far more equal society and to resist the temptation to use nation@@ alism to mask whatever domestic failures may manifest themselves .
brazil ’ s current success is rooted not only in l@@ ula ’ s two terms , which must end in 2010 .
the economic stabili@@ zation program en@@ acted by fern@@ ando hen@@ ri@@ que car@@ do@@ so since 1994 ( the real plan ) , first as finance minister and then as president for two terms , soli@@ di@@ fied a structure that made it possible for l@@ ula ’ s ten@@ ure to be so prosper@@ ous .
his pres@@ iden@@ cy has guaranteed political stability and streng@@ th@@ ened social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on .
indeed , by managing the political process to make the government work for brazil ’ s people , l@@ ula ’ s administration has made brazil a truly stable and con@@ sensu@@ al democracy .
there is nothing modest about that achievement , given brazil ’ s traditional institutional inst@@ ability and the series of major corruption sc@@ and@@ als that eng@@ ul@@ fed l@@ ula ’ s government in 2005 and 2006 .
l@@ ula survived those sc@@ and@@ als and did not move to am@@ end the constitution in order to seek a third term , though some in brazil pres@@ sed him to do so .
l@@ ula also en@@ acted critically important social policies .
under his government , two million homes received electric power for the first time , 11 million very poor families gained the support of a minimum income ( the bol@@ sa fam@@ í@@ lia ) , the minimum salary grew 45 % in real terms , thus benef@@ iting 42 million people .
moreover , eight million jobs were created , 17 million people escaped poverty , and the income of the poorest 50 % grew 32 % – twice as fast as the income of the richest 10 % in the same period .
and l@@ ula achieved all this without trig@@ gering inflation , which he knows – perhaps a result of his own im@@ pover@@ ished childhood – w@@ rea@@ ks ha@@ vo@@ c on the poor most of all .
this vast transformation has not only generated a virtu@@ ous circle that streng@@ th@@ ened institutional stability and social capital .
it has also differenti@@ ated brazil from other countries in latin america , putting the country in the fore@@ front in the region in terms of dealing with traditional social and economic inju@@ st@@ ices in a democratic way .
yet the remaining challenges are huge , for brazil remains the seventh most unequal society in the world – and severe violence persi@@ sts .
six@@ ty-@@ four percent of brazilian homes lack electricity and sanitation , and only 22 % have electricity , a telephone , a computer , a refrigerator , a television , and a washing machine .
in the poorest region , the north and northeast , the numbers fall to 8.@@ 6 % and 8.@@ 3 % .
among the young , almost 37 % of 18-@@ 24-@@ year-olds do not finish high school .
only half the population over age 25 has more than eight years of formal education .
as for brazil ’ s international role , a subtle competition is emerging with the us .
america wants to conclude as many free-@@ trade agre@@ ements in the region as it can , while brazil favor@@ s expanding its custom union , mer@@ co@@ su@@ l / mer@@ co@@ sur .
the entrance of venezuela into the brazilian blo@@ c , brazilian leadership at the united nations mission in haiti , and brazil ’ s role in the hon@@ dur@@ an aff@@ air are all part of this emerging competition .
if brazil is to remain on its prosper@@ ous path , it must continue to give higher priority to its social and economic programs than to foreign adventures .
the construction of a major egal@@ itarian , free , and democratic society that respects and works with the international institutions is the best thing that brazil can give to the world right now .
will syria come in from the cold ?
istanbul – will the recent rap@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement between the united states and syria mark a new era in syria ’ s international standing ?
syria can hope for two major changes following the restor@@ ation of full diplo@@ matic relations with the us .
first , it will be removed from america ’ s informal blac@@ kli@@ st of “ axis of evil ” countries , which will substan@@ tially improve its chances to enter the world trade organization .
second , syria will probably receive the go-@@ ahead for a pipeline to bring ira@@ qi oil across its territory to turkey .
such a link to turkey ’ s economy – and thus possibly to the european union – would encourage syria to open its economy even more to foreign investment .
but all of this will und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly come at a price .
syria ’ s side of the bar@@ gain will inv@@ ari@@ ably need to be an end to its support for he@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h in lebanon , for which it will likely seek the return of the gol@@ an heights .
israel would presumably resist this outcome , and iran – as leader of the so-called “ shi@@ a c@@ res@@ cent ” spreading from lebanon to ta@@ ji@@ ki@@ stan – would strongly , and perhaps viol@@ ently , op@@ pose such a bar@@ gain as well .
during iranian president mahmoud ah@@ ma@@ din@@ eja@@ d ’ s visit to syria earlier this year , syria ’ s president bas@@ har as@@ sad and he reiter@@ ated their un@@ yiel@@ ding cooperation in the face of “ western manipu@@ lations . ”
syria ’ s economy is a r@@ ust pile .
with a per capita income of $ 2,000 , it has been closed to the outside world until recently .
ration@@ ing is pervasive .
but , in order to secure public support , as@@ sad ’ s government has allowed for greater domestic consumption , so foreign impor@@ ts are rising fast .
indeed , the country has run a trade deficit since 2005 , with no path back to balance in sight .
supposedly “ friendly ” countries like iran have been giving a helping hand , but almost always in the form of oil – and not even refined oil – rather than cash .
the effort to liber@@ alize foreign investment has not taken up the sl@@ ack in investment from the regime ’ s regional political partners .
for example , the foreign investment law of 2007 , which fixed a 15-@@ day deadline for projects to be auth@@ orized , has resulted in only $ 200 million in new in@@ ward investment .
this lack of investment has left the economy , particularly the oil industry , in a sham@@ bles .
the rul@@ ing shi@@ a elite that surrounds president as@@ sad – and that , together with the military oli@@ g@@ archy , re@@ tains almost total control of the economy – appears to be interested mainly in preserving the stag@@ nant status quo .
in opposition stand syria ’ s sun@@ ni tra@@ ders , who are joined in demanding a change in the rules of the game by the country ’ s various min@@ orities , composed of two million christians , 1.@@ 7 million kur@@ ds , and 400,000 dru@@ ze .
the combined economic weight of the christians – ne@@ stor@@ ians , mar@@ on@@ ites , catholic greeks , and sy@@ ri@@ ac@@ s – is greater than their actual number , and the bath@@ ist regime has always sought to accommo@@ date these min@@ orities .
but it was only with the acc@@ ession to power of bas@@ hi@@ r al as@@ sad that they were given more economic and political breathing space .
as@@ sad has good reason to do so , because the unequal distribution of wealth , combined with an official unemployment rate of 15 % , is fu@@ eling social pressure .
the $ 3 fare for a bus ride between ale@@ pp@@ o and dama@@ sc@@ us might look cheap to someone from outside syria , but , given that a well-@@ trained technician may earn only $ 150 monthly , it is almost prohi@@ bi@@ tively expensive .
the second positive dynamic may come from improved turk@@ ish@@ -@@ sy@@ rian economic ties .
bil@@ ateral relations started to tha@@ w 12 years ago , when syria exp@@ elled the leader of the violent kur@@ dish se@@ para@@ tist p@@ k@@ k movement , ab@@ dul@@ la@@ h oc@@ alan .
a turk@@ ish@@ -@@ sy@@ rian business council was established soon after with the hope of developing economic relations , but little impact has been felt , o@@ wing to turkey ’ s ling@@ ering suspi@@ cion of syria ’ s political alig@@ nment .
the only turkish investment was made in the textile field by the firm ak@@ te@@ ks .
last year , however , as prime minister re@@ ce@@ p ta@@ y@@ yi@@ p er@@ do@@ gan pushed forward on streng@@ th@@ ening turkey ’ s middle eastern ties , vis@@ a requirements between the two countries were e@@ ased , with cross-@@ border car traffic increasing 22 % in five months .
regular bus lines have been opened , and , according to a high-@@ ran@@ king turkish bank official , “ we were hes@@ it@@ ating about opening a branch in syria because of the us embar@@ go , so the sending of an en@@ vo@@ y is like a green light to us . ”
for syria , the choice now is between sei@@ zing this opportunity to open its economy , or re@@ treating back into its ba@@ ath@@ ist shell . the benefits of such an opening are clear .
the question is whether syria ’ s rul@@ ers can make the political choices necessary to ob@@ tain them .
will the bond bubble burst ?
unless inflation drops much more , now is an ideal time to be a bor@@ ro@@ wer and a bad time to be a len@@ der or investor in long-term bonds .
indeed , in many countries , exagger@@ ated fears of def@@ lation are keeping interest rates depressed and the cost of capital at historic lows .
the lowest rates were seen on june 13 th .
ten-@@ year bonds in the us yiel@@ ded 3.@@ 11 % , not much above the 2.@@ 1 % inflation rate of the past 12 months .
ten-@@ year government bonds in the euro@@ -@@ area yiel@@ ded 3.@@ 54 % , while the euro@@ -@@ area inflation rate was 1.@@ 9 % .
the yield in the uk was 3.@@ 86 % , while inflation was 3 % , and japanese bonds yiel@@ ded 0.@@ 44 % , compared with inflation of -@@ 0.@@ 1 % .
in each case , a small increase in today &apos;s very low inflation rates would eliminate any real gain from investing in bonds .
if low long-term rates do not hold , long-term bond prices will drop shar@@ ply , leaving investors with a loss .
the history of develop@@ ed-@@ country bond markets in the last half-@@ century is relatively straightforward .
consumer inflation increased fairly ste@@ adily ( alb@@ eit with major short-@@ run s@@ wings ) , until the oil crises of 197@@ 3-@@ 4 and 197@@ 9@@ -@@ 81 propelled it to historic high@@ s in europe , north america , japan and other countries .
afterwards , the trend was rever@@ sed , and inflation declined fairly ste@@ adily .
the oil crises marked a political as well as an economic turning point .
until that time , central banks , fe@@ aring recession , were gradually losing their grip on inflation .
but public anger over sk@@ y-@@ high price growth precipit@@ ated by the oil crises finally allowed central banks to ti@@ gh@@ ten credit and s@@ mother inflation with massive global rec@@ essions .
corporate managers , meanwhile , got the public support needed to resist many cost-@@ of-@@ living allo@@ wan@@ ces that were fu@@ eling a wa@@ ge-@@ price spiral .
the general investing public never really understood these trends .
they did not compre@@ hend the upward trend in prices before 1980 , so bond yields , la@@ gging behind rising inflation , were too low .
in the us , ten-@@ year us treas@@ ury yields aver@@ aged only 1.@@ 46 % above the inflation rate between 1953 , when annual average inflation was only 0.@@ 63 % , and march 1980 , when inflation pe@@ aked at 14@@ .@@ 66 % .
nor did the investing public fully compre@@ hend the down@@ trend in inflation after 1980 , so long-term bond yields , la@@ gging behind falling inflation , were too high .
in the us , yields on ten-@@ year treas@@ u@@ ries have aver@@ aged 4.@@ 14 % above the rate of inflation throughout the period of declining inflation that began in april 1980 .
the public &apos;s failure to recognize inflation trends meant that long-term bonds were a terrible investment until 1980 , when inflation was only a little lower than yields , and a lu@@ cra@@ tive investment there@@ after , when declining inflation and high yields guaranteed large real gains .
investors are again making the mistake of pricing bonds in expectation that the down@@ ward trend of inflation will continue into de@@ fla@@ tionary territory .
indeed , today &apos;s low long-term rates suggest that investors are projecting the down@@ ward trend to continue over the next ten years at the same pace that it has done since 1980 , im@@ plying that the current us inflation rate of 2.@@ 1 % would fall to zero or below by 2013 .
is this reasonable ?
no central bank would per@@ mit def@@ lation for long , and the current level of inflation probably represents the lower boundary that most mon@@ etary authorities consider acceptable .
at the same time , there is no such clear upper bound to inflation .
so with inflation rates near their long-term lower bound , the expectation should be for higher , not lower , inflation rates over the longer term .
the current situation in the bond markets does not reflect this because of public over@@ reaction to the talk of def@@ lation , with japan used as a scar@@ ec@@ row .
but even in japan , annual def@@ lation has been only about 0.@@ 7 % since 1998 , and was caused by a mon@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ policy error unlikely to be repeated .
japan is really the only example of advan@@ ce@@ d-@@ country def@@ lation in the post-@@ 1945 era .
so why should bad policy by the bank of japan set the trend for world inflation rates ?
indeed , the opposite may be the case : com@@ b@@ ating def@@ lation could have the per@@ verse effect of creating high inflation .
this is what ma@@ sur@@ u hay@@ ami , the former governor of the bank of japan , fe@@ ared when he resi@@ sted calls for more mon@@ etary stimulus .
he was right to worry : a shar@@ ply expanding money supply may have unexpected and un@@ quantifi@@ able la@@ gged effects .
the kinds of hetero@@ do@@ x mon@@ etary policy that might be used to prevent def@@ lation similarly risk an over@@ reaction and rene@@ wed inflation .
but fear of def@@ lation is so widespread nowadays that if inflation over@@ shoots the target , central banks will merely try to stop further inflation , rather than try to bring the consumer price level back down which would mean def@@ lation .
then any infla@@ tionary mon@@ etary policy errors driven by exagger@@ ated fears of def@@ lation will be allowed to stand , and the cumulative inflation will off@@ set any returns on investments in long-term bonds .
today &apos;s fears about def@@ lation may represent a historic turning point , much as when the public mood turned decisi@@ vely against inflation around 1980 .
conventional wisdom has changed , and many people will be breathing a si@@ gh of relief when inflation rates rise above 3 % or more in the us and elsewhere .
if we have arrived at such a turning point , as the trend in bond markets in recent weeks might suggest , it will be a turning point for interest rates and bond prices as well .
the current combination of excep@@ tionally low yields and high prices suggests that much of the world is in a bon@@ d-@@ market bubble , and when it bur@@ sts in coming years , a period of higher long-term interest rates and lower long-term bond prices will follow .
will the eu keep faith with turkey ?
embar@@ go 6 september 2004
more than for@@ ty years ago , turkey applied for associate mem@@ ber@@ ship of the european economic community .
with the association agreement of 196@@ 3 , a special relationship was established , cul@@ min@@ ating in the cust@@ oms union of 1996 .
during all these years , european governments consistently confir@@ med turkey &apos;s eli@@ gi@@ bility for full mem@@ ber@@ ship , making acc@@ ession dependent on compli@@ ance with mem@@ ber@@ ship criteria .
turkey &apos;s formal recognition as a candidate state in 1999 led turkey to under@@ take unprecedented reform efforts in the area of human and minority rights , including abo@@ li@@ tion of the death penalty , safe@@ guards against torture , promotion of religious freedoms , gender equality , and restri@@ ction of the military &apos;s role in political life .
should the eu consider the acc@@ ession criteria as having been fulfilled , it must decide to open negotiations in early 2005 .
not to do so would mean to rene@@ ge on political commit@@ ments and to severely damage the eu &apos;s credi@@ bility in the world .
in many parts of europe , however , turkey &apos;s ad@@ mission to the eu is viewed with skep@@ ticism o@@ wing to its size , relatively poor economy , fears of massive immigration , and , above all , cultural and societal differences - a eu@@ p@@ hemis@@ m for islam .
it would be fo@@ oli@@ sh to deny that some of these factors represent serious challenges .
however , they are often exagger@@ ated and certainly not insur@@ moun@@ table .
negotiations with turkey would be l@@ eng@@ thy and acc@@ ession may not occur before 2015 .
this period of time would offer both turkey and the union an opportunity to come to terms .
with 80 million people , turkey would be one of the largest eu states .
but the size of a country plays only a limited role in the eu &apos;s decision-making process , because political influence within the union depends more on economic power .
moreover , for decades turkey has been a responsible member of many european institutions , and there is no reason to believe that it would act differently in the eu .
because of its weak economy , turkey would be eli@@ gible for substantial eu assistance .
the size of these transfers , however , would depend on the eu &apos;s financial policies at the time of ad@@ mission , the outcome of acc@@ ession negotiations , and economic developments in turkey .
in any case , the eu &apos;s practice of &quot; ca@@ pping &quot; its budget would prevent an explosion in the financial costs ent@@ a@@ iled by turkey &apos;s acc@@ ession .
immigration should not be a cause for un@@ due concern , either .
human mobility is limited , and turkey workers &apos; would probably be allowed to move freely within the eu only after a long transition period , possibly not before 20@@ 25 .
given the expected up@@ swing of turkey &apos;s economy and its declining birth@@ rate , experts predict a figure of around 2.@@ 7 million immigr@@ ants by that point .
meanwhile , dimin@@ ishing and aging populations in most of europe will have made immigration a necessi@@ ty .
among the countries from where immigration to the eu is probable , turkey has the best pro@@ spe@@ cts for successful adaptation .
it is turkey &apos;s muslim population that creates the strongest emotions .
many feel that turkey simply does not fit into a european society based on christian traditions and culture .
it is also fe@@ ared that islam@@ ists may one day turn turkey into a fundament@@ alist state .
unlikely as it may be in view of turkey &apos;s deeply rooted se@@ cul@@ ar@@ ism , such a risk cannot be totally exclu@@ ded .
but the same is true for any other democracy , where radical groups could well mis@@ use the democratic process for their purposes .
surely , the best protection against such a cal@@ am@@ ity is to streng@@ then turkey &apos;s democratic system , which can best be achieved by an@@ ch@@ oring it firmly in a blo@@ c of similarly democratic countries .
as for the eu , it must decide whether it wants to be a closed &quot; christian club &quot; or an open and inclusive society , drawing strength from cultural and religious diversity .
turkey &apos;s acc@@ ession to the union would give a powerful answer , one that would be heard with particular clarity in the islamic world .
at the same time , the risks of reje@@ cting turkey must also be taken into account : the likelihood that the reform process would collapse , bringing radical currents to the fore and leading to inst@@ ability and political un@@ rest at the eu &apos;s door@@ steps .
turkish eu mem@@ ber@@ ship presents both opportunities and challenges .
on balance , however , the advantages far out@@ weigh the risks .
will the euro de@@ thr@@ one the dollar ?
much of america ’ s dominance in world finance comes from the dollar ’ s status as international money .
but american spending habits have under@@ min@@ ed the dollar ’ s reputation , with the excess supply of dollars on world markets depressing its price .
this spring , the euro ’ s exchange rate against the dollar reached an all-@@ time high , and central banks have increased the euro share of their international reserves .
is the dollar about to lose the cro@@ wn of world finance to the euro ?
american financial supre@@ macy in the twenty-@@ first century resem@@ bles britain ’ s position in world finance a century ago .
before the outbreak of world war i in august 19@@ 14 , the pound ster@@ ling served as the currency of choice for international trans@@ actions , just as the dollar does today , and the world ’ s bor@@ ro@@ wers visited the city of london to raise capital .
the british economist john may@@ n@@ ard key@@ nes worried that countries would not use ster@@ ling to settle trading balances with each other if the pound were not viewed as a reliable store of value .
the “ future position of the city of london , ” according to key@@ nes , depended on the pound ster@@ ling continuing to serve the business world as the equivalent of gold .
britain main@@ tained the pound ’ s conver@@ ti@@ bility into gold at the outbreak of the great war to preserve its credi@@ bility as the international medium of exchange .
the dollar could not challenge ster@@ ling ’ s role as the world ’ s currency without matching its reputation .
august 19@@ 14 provided the opportunity .
the biggest gold out@@ flow in a generation imper@@ iled america ’ s ability to re@@ pay its deb@@ ts abroad .
fear that the us would abandon the gold standard sent the dollar plum@@ me@@ ting on world markets .
but treas@@ ury secretary william g. m@@ ca@@ doo secu@@ red american financial honor in august 19@@ 14 by remaining true to gold while everyone else , except for the british , abandoned their obli@@ ga@@ tions .
despite the dollar ’ s instant credi@@ bility , however , it took more than a decade for america ’ s currency to match britain ’ s as an international medium of exchange .
britain ’ s transformation from international credi@@ tor to international deb@@ tor during the great war gave the dollar a second wind in its battle with ster@@ ling .
the british were forced to abandon gold conver@@ ti@@ bility in april 19@@ 19 – a tac@@ tical with@@ dra@@ wal intended to pa@@ ve the way for britain ’ s return to the former $ 4.@@ 8@@ 6@@ 65 par@@ ity with the american dollar .
six years later , in april 19@@ 25 , britain confir@@ med its mon@@ etary credi@@ bility and returned to the gold standard .
but the pound had already suffered ir@@ repar@@ able damage .
the experience of 19@@ 14 impli@@ es that a credible alternative can replace an ent@@ ren@@ ched world currency , especially after an un@@ favor@@ able balance of trade has weak@@ ened it .
but even then , de@@ thr@@ oning the rei@@ g@@ ning king of international exchange takes time .
today , the euro – a currency without a country – lac@@ ks a long track record of credi@@ bility .
thir@@ teen countries in the european union use the euro as money .
but the commitment of these independent political entities to the euro cannot match the history of america ’ s commitment to the dollar .
the european central bank , established in 1998 , has a mandate to manage the new currency to maintain price stability .
it cannot hit@@ ch a ride on gold , the way america did a century ago .
so the euro must earn its reputation crisis by crisis to confront the dollar ’ s dominance as the currency of choice for international trans@@ actions .
recent experience with the euro as an official reserve asset is instruc@@ tive .
between 2000 and 2005 , the dollar lost more than 25 % of its value against the euro .
meanwhile , the fraction of international reserves held in euros grew from 18 % to 24 % , and the dollar ’ s share dropped from 71 % to 66 % .
in short , the euro has clearly made some head@@ way during this period of us balance of payment defic@@ its , but this reflects an evolutionary decline in the dollar ’ s dominance , not a revolutionary regime shift .
what might trigger a fatal run on the dollar in world markets ?
while a broad and ab@@ rupt sell@@ -@@ off by major foreign holders of dollars – for example , china – appears unlikely , a cat@@ ac@@ ly@@ s@@ mic event , similar to the outbreak of the great war in 19@@ 14 , could promp@@ t a search for a new international medium of exchange .
in the modern era of automated payments , the up@@ hea@@ val might come from a terrorist attack that under@@ mines the compu@@ teri@@ zed transfer facilities of the world ’ s banking system .
a catastrophic loss of electronic records could surely destroy the credi@@ bility of the dollar as the international medium of exchange .
but exactly what would replace the dollar under such circumstances remains an open question .
after all , a loss of computer records would make the euro equally suspect .
perhaps gold , a store of value imper@@ vi@@ ous to physical distor@@ tion , could make a come@@ back .
of course , one can only hope that such a scenario remains pure con@@ jec@@ ture .
will the euro survive the current crisis ?
cambridge – the european economic and mon@@ etary union ( em@@ u ) and the euro are about to celebrate their tenth anniversary .
the euro was introduced without serious problems and has since func@@ tioned well , with the european central bank delivering the low inflation that is its sole mandate .
but the current economic crisis may provide a severe test of the euro ’ s ability to survive in more troubled times .
while the crisis could streng@@ then the institutions provided by the em@@ u , it could also create multiple risks , of which member countries need to be aware if they want to avoid them .
the primary problem is that conditions in individual em@@ u members may develop in such different ways that some national political leaders could be temp@@ ted to conclude that their countries would be better served by adopting a mix of policies different from that of the other members .
the current differences in the interest rates of euro@@ -@@ zone government bonds show that the financial markets regard a break@@ -up as a real possibility .
ten-@@ year government bonds in greece and ireland , for example , now pay nearly a full percentage point above the rate on comparable german bonds , and italy ’ s rate is almost as high .
there have , of course , been many examples in history in which currency uni@@ ons or single-@@ currency states have broken up .
although there are technical and legal reasons why such a split would be harder for an em@@ u country , there seems little doubt that a country could with@@ draw if it really wanted to .
the most obvious reason that a country might choose to with@@ draw is to escape from the one-@@ si@@ ze-@@ fit@@ s-@@ all mon@@ etary policy imposed by the single currency .
a country that finds its economy very depressed during the next few years , and fears that this will be chronic , might be temp@@ ted to leave the em@@ u in order to ease mon@@ etary conditions and de@@ value its currency .
although that may or may not be economically sensible , a country in a severe economic down@@ turn might very well take such a policy decision .
the stability and growth p@@ act , which limits euro@@ -@@ zone members ’ fiscal defic@@ its , is another reason why a country might want to leave the em@@ u . in a serious down@@ turn , a country may wish to pursue a traditional ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian policy through large-scale , defic@@ it-@@ finan@@ ced fiscal stimulus .
although the stability and growth p@@ act may be el@@ astic enough to per@@ mit some deficit stimulus , a country may feel constrained from acting as aggressi@@ vely as it wants .
the current financial crisis raises yet another problem : the lack of a clear “ len@@ der of last resort . ”
it remains to be seen how willing the ec@@ b will be to provide national central banks with the volume of euros needed to play this role fully .
if a country sees its banks failing because its national bank cannot l@@ end them enough , it may chose to leave the em@@ u so that its central bank can provide whatever amount of local currency it de@@ ems necessary .
moreover , the current economic crisis has led to rene@@ wed talk about the need for the european union to have tax@@ ing authority .
whatever the logic of that proposition , it would open the door to much greater income re@@ distribution .
even if officials do not want to abandon the euro , they may come to do so as a result of a strategy of trying to get other countries to agree to a policy change .
a country that believes that mon@@ etary or fiscal policy is too tight may threaten to leave if policy is not changed .
that is clearly a substantial risk if the country is germany or france .
but even if it is one of the smaller countries , it might be a serious threat because it could be seen as the beginning of the end .
so either type of country could make the threat in the hope that it would be enough to cause their em@@ u colleagues to agree to their des@@ ired change in policy .
the risk , of course , is that the other countries may not be inti@@ mid@@ ated .
the threatening country would then have to choose whether to accepting a humili@@ ating defeat and stay , or stand on “ principle ” and leave .
all of this assumes that political leaders would select only a policy change that they think will be in their nation ’ s long-term interest .
but there is also a risk that some politicians act sol@@ ely out of self-interest , sei@@ zing on the economic down@@ turn as an opportunity to get elected by promising to with@@ draw the country from the em@@ u , or by saying that they will threaten to do so if the other member countries do not agree to their proposed policy changes .
none of these risks impli@@ es that the mon@@ etary union will inevitably be a victim of this severe economic down@@ turn .
but the down@@ turn will be a more severe test for the euro than any that it faced during its first ten years .
will the imf stand up to europe ?
cambridge – as the euro@@ zone crisis continues to deep@@ en , the international mon@@ etary fund may finally be acknowled@@ ging the need to reas@@ s@@ ess its approach .
new managing director christ@@ ine la@@ gar@@ de ’ s recent call for forced recap@@ it@@ alization of europe ’ s bank@@ rupt banking system is a good start .
european officials ’ incen@@ sed reaction – the banks are fine , they insist , and need only liqui@@ dity support – should serve to but@@ tress the fund ’ s determination to be sensible about europe .
until now , the fund has sy@@ cop@@ han@@ tically supported each new european initiative to rescue the over-@@ inde@@ b@@ ted euro@@ zone peripher@@ y , commit@@ ting more than $ 100 billion to greece , portugal , and ireland so far .
unfortunately , the imf is ris@@ king not only its members ’ money , but , ultimately , its own institutional credi@@ bility .
only a year ago , at the imf ’ s annual meeting in washington , dc , senior staff were telling anyone who would listen that the whole european sovereig@@ n-@@ debt panic was a tempest in a teapot .
using sli@@ ck powerpoint presentations with titles like “ default in today ’ s advanced economies : unnecessary , un@@ des@@ ir@@ able , and unlikely , ” the fund tried to convince investors that euro@@ zone debt was solid as a rock .
even for greece , the imf argued , debt dynamics were not a serious concern , thanks to anticipated growth and reforms .
never mind the obvious fla@@ w in the fund ’ s logic , namely that countries such as greece and portugal face policy and imple@@ mentation risks far more ak@@ in to emerging markets than to truly advanced economies such as germany and the united states .
as the situation de@@ terior@@ ated , one might have gu@@ essed that the imf would mark its beliefs to market , as it were , and adopt a more cau@@ tious tone .
instead , at the imf ’ s april 2011 inter@@ im meeting , a senior official declared that the fund now consi@@ ders troubled spain to be a core euro@@ zone country like germany , rather than a peripher@@ al country like greece , portugal , or ireland .
evi@@ dently , investors were supposed to in@@ fer that for all practical purposes they should think of spanish and german debt as identical – the old hu@@ bris of the euro@@ zone .
my own sar@@ ca@@ stic reaction was to think , “ oh , now the imf thinks that some of the core euro@@ zone countries are a default risk . ”
having served as the imf ’ s chief economist from 2001 to 2003 , i am familiar with the fund ’ s need to walk a ti@@ gh@@ tro@@ pe between building investor confidence and shaking up com@@ plac@@ ent policymakers .
but it is one thing to be circum@@ spect in the midst of a crisis ; it is quite another to spe@@ w nonsense .
the late chic@@ a@@ go-@@ school economist george sti@@ gler would have described the imf ’ s role in europe as reflecting acute “ regul@@ atory capture . ”
simply put , europe and the us control too much power in the imf , and their thinking is too dominant .
what european leaders may want most from the fund are easy loans and strong rhetor@@ ical support .
but what europe really needs is the kind of honest assessment and tough love that the fund has traditionally offered to its other , less politically influential , clients .
the imf ’ s blind spot in dealing with europe until now is only partly due to european voting power .
it also ste@@ ms from an “ us ” and “ them ” mentality that similarly per@@ me@@ ates research at the top wall street investment houses .
analy@@ sts who have worked their entire lives only on advanced economies have learned to bet on things going well , because for the couple of decades prior to the crisis , things mostly did go well – very well .
that is why , for example , so many keep assuming that a normal rapid recovery is just around the corner .
but the financial crisis should have reminded everyone that the distinction between advanced economies and emerging markets is not a bright red line .
in his recent speech in jackson hole , wy@@ oming , us federal reserve chair@@ man ben ber@@ nan@@ ke for@@ ce@@ fully complained that political paralysis has possibly become the principal im@@ pedi@@ ment to recovery .
but analy@@ sts ac@@ custom@@ ed to working on emerging markets understand that such paralysis is very difficult to avoid after a financial crisis .
rather than sla@@ vis@@ h@@ ly believing policymakers ’ as@@ sur@@ ances , emer@@ g@@ ing-@@ market researchers have learned to be cy@@ ni@@ cal about official promises .
all too often , everything that can be done wrong will be done wrong .
the imf needs to bring much more of this brand of skep@@ ticism to its assessment of euro@@ zone debt dynamics , instead of constantly seeking stra@@ ined assumptions that would make the debt appear sustainable .
anyone looking closely at europe ’ s complex options for ex@@ tri@@ c@@ ating itself from its debt straight@@ jacket should realize that political constraints will be a huge obstacle no matter which route europe takes .
even outside europe , the imf has long given too much cre@@ dence to sitting governments , rather than focusing on the long-term interests of the country and its people .
the fund is doing europe ’ s people no favor by failing to push aggressi@@ vely for a more realistic solution , including dramatic debt wri@@ te-@@ downs for peripher@@ al euro@@ zone countries and re-@@ allo@@ c@@ ating cor@@ e-@@ country guarante@@ es elsewhere .
now that the fund has squ@@ ar@@ ely acknowled@@ ged the huge capital holes in many european banks , it should start pressing for@@ ce@@ fully for a comprehensive and credible solution to the euro@@ zone debt crisis , a solution that will involve either partial break@@ up of the euro@@ zone or fundamental constitu@@ tional reform .
europe ’ s future , not to mention the future of the imf , depends on it .
will the iraq war kill globalization ?
the un and nato are widely perceived as damaged , if not broken , by their failure to agree on what to do about iraq .
will these cracks in the international political system now wound the world &apos;s economic architecture , and with it globalization , as well ?
international economic agre@@ ements have never been easy to make .
reaching consensus among the world trade organization &apos;s 1@@ 45 members , where one dis@@ sent can cause utter dis@@ array , was difficult even before the world &apos;s governments divided into pro@@ - and anti-@@ american camps .
indeed , multi@@ lat@@ eral trade agre@@ ements were being ec@@ lip@@ sed by bil@@ ateral deals , such as between the eu and various developing countries , long before the di@@ visions over iraq appeared .
of course , the problem goes deeper and not everything that touches globalization has turned dark .
immigration controls , for example , have been relaxed in several european countries ( not@@ ably germany ) due to declining populations and educational short@@ com@@ ings .
but bad economic times are rarely moments when governments push bold international economic pro@@ pos@@ als .
economic fragi@@ lity among the world &apos;s leading economies is the biggest stum@@ bling block .
the us and the eu have few fiscal and mon@@ etary levers left to combat weak performance .
short-term interest rates in the us , at 1.@@ 25 % , are at a 40-@@ year low .
congress has par@@ ed $ 100 billion from the bush administration &apos;s 10-@@ year $ 7@@ 26 billion tax cut plan , and the us &apos;s projected 10-@@ year $ 2 trillion budget deficit will grow as the iraq war &apos;s costs mount , with president bush sub@@ mit@@ ting a supp@@ le@@ mental request for $ 80@@ b@@ n ( 0.@@ 8 % of gdp ) in extra military spending this year .
such spending risks absorb productive resources that could be employed more efficiently elsewhere .
this was demonstrated by the rapid growth of output and incomes that followed the arri@@ val of the so-called &quot; peace divi@@ dend &quot; which came with the cold war &apos;s end .
moreover , others ( arab countries , germany , and japan ) will not cover america &apos;s military costs , as in the 1991 gulf war .
we are now back to the more usual situation where war is finan@@ ced by government debt , which bur@@ dens future generations unless it is ero@@ ded by inflation .
but the european central bank remains reluctant to ease mon@@ etary policy .
in japan , there seems little hope that the world &apos;s second-@@ largest economy can ex@@ tri@@ cate itself from its home@@ made def@@ lation trap to generate the demand needed to off@@ set economic weakness elsewhere in the world .
four years of def@@ lation and a dra@@ w@@ n-@@ out banking crisis offer little prospect of economic stimulus .
higher oil prices and lower trade tur@@ no@@ ver ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ate the problem .
oil prices have flir@@ ted with their highest level since the gulf war and will go higher if iraq &apos;s oil infrastructure ( or that of neighbor@@ ing countries ) is damaged .
the ad@@ verse effects on growth will be felt everywhere , but nowhere more , perhaps , than in the energy-@@ dependent south korea and china .
although china &apos;s official growth rate reached 8 % in 2002 , its high budget deficit and large stock of non-@@ performing loans ( about 40 % of gdp ) mean that it cannot afford any slow@@ down if it is to keep people employed , especially in rural areas .
some poor economies will be directly damaged by the loss of the iraq market , which accounts for roughly 40 % of vietnam &apos;s tea exports and 20 % of its rice exports .
for others , weakness in the world &apos;s big economies may be com@@ po@@ unded by political risks .
turkey has suffered from rising oil prices , falling tourism income ( its second-@@ largest source of foreign exchange ) , and declining foreign investment .
now the er@@ do@@ gan government &apos;s lu@@ ke@@ warm support for us policy on iraq ex@@ poses turkey to doub@@ ts about america &apos;s commitment to its economic well being , and global markets may question its ability to service its $ 100 billion publi@@ c-@@ sector debt in 2003 and 2004 .
the test of whether multi@@ lat@@ eral cooperation can be put back on track , and re@@ conc@@ iled with america &apos;s war against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , may come with iraq &apos;s reconstruction .
with the costs of ou@@ sting saddam hussein and occu@@ p@@ ying iraq likely to run at anywhere from $ 100 to $ 600 billion over the next decade , the us will want to &quot; internation@@ alize &quot; iraq &apos;s reconstruction .
iraq &apos;s $ 20 billion annual oil revenues cannot meet such costs .
indeed , those revenues will sc@@ arc@@ ely cover the costs of rebuilding basic infrastructure , feeding and housing displaced populations , and paying for the country &apos;s civil administration .
after the ou@@ ster of the taliban last year , the $ 4.@@ 5 billion of reconstruction aid ple@@ dged to afghanistan &apos;s new government demonstrated that a multi@@ lat@@ eral approach to reconstruction is possible .
but the pois@@ oned atmosphere that followed the un deb@@ ates on iraq may prevent the us from getting its way here .
already , french president jacques chi@@ ra@@ c has promised to ve@@ to any security council resolution on reconstruction that see@@ ks to justify the war .
if the world economy is to recover , the diplo@@ matic failures and nam@@ e-@@ calling must end .
will the me@@ ek inher@@ it russia ?
moscow – in a recent interview , russia ’ s president d@@ mit@@ ri med@@ ve@@ de@@ v pro@@ cla@@ imed that he wants a second term in office following the 2012 election , but that he would not run against prime minister v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin , who put him in power in the first place .
such a ri@@ val@@ ry , med@@ ve@@ de@@ v impli@@ ed , would damage the country ’ s well-being and image .
med@@ ve@@ de@@ v ’ s statement should end specu@@ lation about whether he is running , yet it keeps the suspen@@ se alive regar@@ ding pu@@ tin , whose influence is far greater than that of russia ’ s me@@ ek president .
many , particularly in the west , would like to see pu@@ tin and his prick@@ ly , anti-@@ western author@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism pass from the scene .
indeed , over the last ten years , russian foreign policy has been animated by defen@@ si@@ veness and suspi@@ cion .
russia even has un@@ easy relations with the con@@ gen@@ it@@ ally non-@@ threatening european union .
it is touch@@ y about the independence of the near-@@ abroad countries , especially those politically or geographi@@ cally close to the west – bel@@ ar@@ us , mol@@ do@@ va , ukra@@ ine , and georgia .
more than a decade after the fact , the kre@@ m@@ lin still de@@ cri@@ es nato ’ s e@@ ast@@ ward en@@ lar@@ gement as a security threat .
the reality , of course , is that nato is as much of an offensive threat to russia as switzerland is .
but it is not nato ’ s military power that pu@@ tin ’ s kre@@ m@@ lin finds alarming ; the real threat is the alliance ’ s potential to “ swallow ” mol@@ do@@ va or ukra@@ ine at some point .
creating a prece@@ dent for the democra@@ tization of post-@@ soviet space is a nightmare scenario for pu@@ tin and his cr@@ onies .
as in soviet times , the main task of today ’ s rul@@ ing elite – pu@@ tin and his former k@@ gb associ@@ ates – is to preserve their ti@@ ght-@@ kn@@ it political and economic regime , built for their personal control and material benefit .
russian foreign policy is , as it was under the so@@ vie@@ ts , an extension of official domestic priorities .
the current regime is clearly auto@@ cratic .
yet it asp@@ ires to democratic legiti@@ macy in the eyes of russian citizens and the international community .
it is to this end that med@@ ve@@ de@@ v performs his civili@@ zing mission – participating in world for@@ ums , posting twitter updates , ber@@ ating ramp@@ ant corruption , and supporting “ moderni@@ zation ” and the “ rule of law . ”
the result of this du@@ ality – authoritarian establishment and po@@ tem@@ kin village democratic fa@@ ç@@ ade – is that russia occupi@@ es a unique geo@@ political no man ’ s land .
a democratic russia would want to catch up with the west and integrate into western institutions .
yet this is not in the group interests of pu@@ tin ’ s back@@ ers , the people who run , and own , russia : its security , military , and industrial complex .
of course , these people have been personally integrated into europe for two decades now – their money is in european banks ; their holiday v@@ illas are in the south of france , tus@@ c@@ any , and the greek is@@ les ; their children are educated in the pos@@ h@@ est boarding schools .
so , despite the current regime ’ s tough , often anti-@@ western rhetoric , they are not at all interested in closing russia off from the west .
what they want is to prevent the integration with the west of russia itself , for that would mean the end of their regime .
but , to sustain the char@@ ade of a strong and prosper@@ ous russia , standing against the pre@@ dations and hypo@@ cris@@ y of the west , the regime cannot be as authoritarian as pu@@ tin himself might wish .
if it were , swiss banks and international organizations would close their doors .
so the regime ’ s back@@ ers have a strong interest in maintaining its “ democratic ” side .
the west , despite its years of experience in dealing with the so@@ vie@@ ts , is still a su@@ cker for such jan@@ us-@@ like behavior , especially now , when med@@ ve@@ de@@ v presents such an ende@@ aring democratic face .
in june , speaking at the st. peter@@ sburg economic forum , med@@ ve@@ de@@ v mes@@ m@@ eri@@ zed his audience by simultaneously so@@ unding av@@ ant-@@ gar@@ de and hack@@ ne@@ yed : he attacked corruption , vo@@ wed that russia is not “ building state capitalism , ” and promised legal and federal reforms .
decisions , he said , should be left to business or made locally , not in the kre@@ m@@ lin .
the st. peter@@ sburg economic forum is mostly for international consumption .
if western bankers and investors want to buy snake oil , that is their business .
but no one should leave such events thinking that anything med@@ ve@@ de@@ v says means that russia is changing .
us vice president joe bi@@ den , usually a sharp critic of russia , arrived in moscow in march , supposedly to convince pu@@ tin to sur@@ render his presidential ambi@@ tions for 2012 .
a month later , talking to pu@@ tin by phone , bi@@ den invited him to visit washington , though , according to russia ’ s constitution , the prime minister has no foreig@@ n-@@ policy role .
does the united states support pu@@ tin in the elections , or , by recognizing pu@@ tin ’ s historic importance , do the americans mean to convince him to leave power ?
no one knows .
until russia ’ s internal political situation changes , relations with the west will remain un@@ changed and ambiguous .
pu@@ tin , however , would be well advis@@ ed to listen to bi@@ den , who is ru@@ mor@@ ed to have offered him important international positions , such as chair@@ ing the international olympic committee , or perhaps even leading the united nations .
after all , pu@@ tin knows well the old soviet play@@ book : the fate of previous k@@ gb func@@ tion@@ aries may a@@ wait him .
dre@@ aded secre@@ t-@@ police chief la@@ v@@ rent@@ i ber@@ ia , who operated the machinery of repres@@ sion under joseph stalin , was executed by the system he perfe@@ cted , after being sent@@ enced to death in 1953 for “ sp@@ ying against the state . ”
in his decade in power , pu@@ tin has con@@ soli@@ dated and streng@@ th@@ ened the security forces , inti@@ mid@@ ated and ja@@ iled oppon@@ ents , and mu@@ zz@@ led the media and courts .
if he doesn ’ t step down or aside so that russia can move forward , the system he has created may turn his own methods against him .
will the next democratic revolution be egypt ’ s ?
responses to america ’ s call for democracy in the middle east have been te@@ pid at best .
arab governments feel provo@@ ked by president george w. bush , particularly as he announced his initiative with little regional consul@@ tation .
seeking to pre-@@ em@@ pt american action , egypt backed a counter-@@ proposal , the alexandria declar@@ ation , at an arab league summit last may , and followed this with president ho@@ sn@@ i mubarak ’ s recent announcement that he will allow opposition candidates to challenge him for the pres@@ iden@@ cy .
is this just another st@@ alling tac@@ tic , or an opening to real reform ?
what is clear is that the recent elections in iraq and palestine , together with the sw@@ elling prote@@ sts against syria ’ s distor@@ ting influence on lebanon ’ s democracy , have rein@@ vi@@ gor@@ ated debate about political reform within egypt .
members of the opposition have argued that the country is comp@@ elled to reform itself if it is not to have reform imposed from abroad .
going further , the managing director of one newspaper claims that del@@ a@@ ying political and constitu@@ tional reform as if it were a grant to citizens – rather than their right – would invite outside intervention in egypt ’ s domestic affairs .
arab democracy , he claims , has now become a domestic concern in the united states , which will make it hard for american presidents to swe@@ ep the ab@@ uses of friendly arab regimes under the ru@@ g , as they did in the past .
in the arab world , authoritarian governments have depri@@ ved people of political , civil , and intellectual freedoms for decades .
for young citizens , particularly islam@@ ists , normal channels of political participation have been closed off .
as a result , they have gravi@@ tated towards underground extrem@@ ist movements .
poverty , cr@@ ony@@ ism , and official corruption hei@@ gh@@ ten this popular frustration .
in this climate , the momentum for political and constitu@@ tional reform in egypt is gathering pace .
there is great nostal@@ gia for the last liberal experiment ( from the 19@@ 20 ’ s until the 195@@ 2 revolution ) , which was a model for other arab countries .
egypt ’ s vibrant political life , press , and liberal culture were then supported by an ideology of secular nation@@ alism and improved religious harmony .
there was a vibrant multi@@ party parli@@ am@@ entary democracy , with an independent ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary and one of the world ’ s earliest movements for female eman@@ ci@@ pation .
the achievements and aspirations of that liberal experiment today unite egyptians who favor reform .
they have even inspired the birth of a new political party , hi@@ z@@ b al g@@ had ( the party of tomorrow ) , founded by a young parli@@ am@@ ent@@ arian committed to democratic reform .
the party den@@ ies the argument that democracy will foster islamic extremism and claims that it is the delay of reform that presents a major source of danger .
hi@@ z@@ b al g@@ had recently produced a 4@@ 8-@@ page dra@@ ft constitution , aimed at revi@@ ving egypt ’ s stag@@ nant political life .
its pre@@ am@@ ble , which opens with the phrase “ we , the egyptian people , ” can be read as a sc@@ a@@ thing attack on egypt ’ s current political order , and calls for an end to fear and des@@ po@@ tism .
among the document ’ s pro@@ pos@@ als is an end to the emergency rule imposed since president an@@ war sad@@ at ’ s ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation in 1981 .
that seemingly endless “ emergency ” has resulted in the severe restri@@ ction , or even suspension , of individual and political liber@@ ties .
other pro@@ visions include cur@@ bing the far-@@ reaching powers granted to the president in the 1971 constitution and introducing direct presidential elections with multiple candidates .
the dra@@ ft constitution would transform egypt into a parli@@ am@@ entary republic .
the dominant national democratic party ( n@@ dp ) takes a different view , arguing that political change can be achieved without constitu@@ tional reform .
the n@@ dp appears to believe that democra@@ tization must begin with changing the political culture and inst@@ illing democratic values .
these steps would prece@@ de concrete legal and constitu@@ tional reforms , such as those proposed by hi@@ z@@ b al g@@ had .
so far , however , the n@@ dp has missed every opportunity imagin@@ able to gain popular support by proposing a reform program designed to bring real increases in public participation .
this is one reason why mubarak ’ s call to hold a multi-@@ candidate presidential election failed to gal@@ vani@@ ze egypt ’ s elec@@ tor@@ ate .
the government , indeed , pre@@ fers to offer only hol@@ low initi@@ atives focused nar@@ row@@ ly on the economy .
the conflict between the two visions of reform should not obscure the fact that there is a general consensus in egypt : substantial reform of some kind is necessary and long over@@ due .
most importantly , liberal voices in egypt are not merely a response to us democratic initi@@ atives .
they are a home@@ grown challenge to an ent@@ ren@@ ched political order , and they are riding a powerful historical current .
will the pollu@@ ters pay for climate change ?
i am writing this in new york in early august , when the mayor declared a “ heat emergency ” to prevent widespread electricity ou@@ tages from the expected high use of air condi@@ tion@@ ers .
city employees could face criminal charges if they set their thermo@@ stats below 78 degrees fahrenheit ( 25@@ .@@ 5 celsius ) .
nevertheless , electricity usage has reached near-@@ record levels .
meanwhile california has emerged from its own recor@@ d-@@ breaking heat wave .
for the united states as a whole , the first six months of 2006 were the hot@@ test in more than a century .
europe is experiencing an un@@ usually hot summer , too .
july set new records in england and the netherlands , where weather data go back more than 300 years .
the hot northern summer fits well with the release of an inconvenient truth , a documentary film fe@@ atur@@ ing former us vi@@ ce-@@ president al gore .
using some remarkable graphs , images , and other information , the film makes a compelling case that our carbon dioxide emissions are causing global warming , or , at the very least , contributing to it , and that we must ur@@ gently address the issue .
americans tend to talk a lot about morality and justice .
but most americans still fail to realize that their country ’ s ref@@ us@@ al to sign the kyoto protocol , and their subsequ@@ ent business – as-@@ usual approach to greenhouse gas emissions , is a moral failing of the most serious kind .
it is already having harmful consequences for others , and the greatest ine@@ qu@@ ity is that it is the rich who are using most of the energy that leads to the emissions that cause climate change , while it is the poor who will bear most of the costs .
( to see what you can do to reduce your own contribution , go to www.@@ cli@@ ma@@ te@@ cris@@ is@@ .@@ net@@ . )
to see the ine@@ qu@@ ity , i merely have to gl@@ ance up at the air condi@@ tion@@ er that is keeping my office be@@ arable .
while i ’ ve done more than the mayor requ@@ est@@ ed , setting it at 8@@ 2@@ f ( 2@@ 7@@ c ) , i ’ m still part of a feedback loop .
i deal with the heat by using more energy , which leads to burning more fossil fuel , putting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and heating up the planet more .
it even happened when i watched an inconvenient truth : on a warm evening , the cinema was so chil@@ ly that i wished i had brought a jacket .
heat kills .
a heat wave in france in 2003 caused an estimated 3@@ 5,000 deaths , and a hot spell similar to the one britain had last month caused more than 2,000 deaths , according to official estimates .
although no particular heat wave can be directly attribu@@ ted to global warming , it will make such events more frequent .
moreover , if global warming continues un@@ checked , the number of deaths that occur when rainfall becomes more er@@ ra@@ tic , causing both pro@@ lon@@ ged dr@@ ou@@ ghts and severe floods , will d@@ warf the death toll from hot weather in europe .
melting polar ice will cause rising seas to in@@ un@@ date low-@@ lying ferti@@ le delta regions on which hundreds of millions of people grow their food .
tropical diseases will spread , killing still more people .
overwhel@@ m@@ ingly , the dead will be those who lack the resources to adapt , to find alternative sources of food , and who do not have access to health care .
even in rich countries , it usually isn ’ t the rich who die in natural disasters .
when hurricane katrina hit new orleans , those who died were the poor in low-@@ lying areas who lac@@ ked cars to escape .
if this is true in a country like the us , with a reasonably efficient infrastructure and the resources to help its citizens in times of crisis , it is even more evident when disasters strike developing countries , because their governments lack the resources needed , and because , when it comes to foreign assistance , rich nations still do not count all human lives equally .
according to united nations figures , in 2002 per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in the us were 16 times higher than in india , 60 times higher than in bangladesh , and more than 200 times higher than in ethiopia , mal@@ i , or chad .
other developed nations with emissions close to those of the us include australia , canada , and lux@@ em@@ bour@@ g .
russia , germany , britain , italy , france , and spain all have levels between a half and a quarter that of the us .
this is still significantly above the world average , and more than 50 times that of the poorest nations in which people will die from global warming .
if a pollu@@ ter har@@ ms others , those who are har@@ med normally have a legal reme@@ dy .
for example , if a factory leaks toxic chemicals into a river that i use to irri@@ gate my farm , killing my crops , i can sue the factory owner .
if the rich nations poll@@ ute the atmosphere with carbon dioxide , causing my crops to fail because of changing rainfall patterns , or my fields are in@@ und@@ ated by a rise in the sea level , shouldn ’ t i also be able to sue ?
cam@@ illa tou@@ l@@ min , who direc@@ ts the international institute for environment and development , a lon@@ d@@ on-@@ based ngo , was present at a lecture on climate change that al gore gave in june .
she asked him what he thought about compen@@ sation for those who are hit hardest by climate change , but who have done the least to cause it .
the question , she reports on www.@@ open@@ democra@@ cy@@ .@@ net , seemed to take him by surprise , and he did not support the idea .
like tou@@ l@@ min , i wonder if this is a truth that is just too inconvenient , even for him .
will the rum@@ s@@ feld revolution continue ?
america ’ s defense policy is at a cross@@ roads .
since 1997 , the united states congress has required the department of defense to under@@ take a major defense review every four years .
the department is currently developing the third such review and will release it later this year .
the review promises to be nothing short of a water@@ shed .
the last quad@@ ren@@ ni@@ al defense review was published a few weeks after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . as a result , it gave only hin@@ ts of the counter@@ terrorism strategy to come .
the 2005 review , by contrast , will represent several years of thinking by the bush administration , and thus will serve as a key indic@@ ator of the future course of american defense policy .
the grand strategy that serves as the foundation for american defense policy has not under@@ gone major change since 2002 .
focusing on terrorism , the strategy calls for streng@@ th@@ ening the network of international partners seeking to eradicate transnational terrorism , and for direct action against terrorist organizations and their sponsor@@ s .
ultimately , it see@@ ks to address what president bush consi@@ ders the root causes of terrorism , particularly the absence of open political systems and economic opportunity .
what is changing is the way that us military power is used to implement this grand strategy .
there is little doubt that the 2005 defense review will form@@ alize the change in focus underway since september 11 , 2001 .
before that , the american military concentrated on swi@@ ft victory in a major theater war against another state ’ s military forces .
today , however , the us military is more likely to be used to stabilize and rebuild failed states , ass@@ ist partners in counter@@ ing insur@@ gency and terrorism , control nuclear weapons when regimes collapse , or directly eradicate terrorist organizations and their suppor@@ ters .
this requires a different type of force , and one capable of running a marathon rather than a spr@@ int , sustaining major deplo@@ y@@ ments for extended periods .
the global configuration of america ’ s military is also changing .
the goal is to keep most of the force sta@@ tioned at home in the us , with a network of light@@ ly-@@ man@@ ned bases abroad that can serve as forward operating locations during a crisis or war .
rather than being mini@@ ature americas , many of these bases will be operated in con@@ junction with or by the host nation .
this will capit@@ alize on the us military ’ s ability to project force around the world quickly , while providing a more flexible and politically pal@@ at@@ able way of doing so .
but , beyond the ongoing changes , major strategic questions persist .
first , how much conventional war@@ -@@ fighting capability should the us military retain ?
the goal is to maintain enough to deter ag@@ gress@@ ors , but not so much that it de@@ tra@@ cts from other , more likely missions .
second , what will america ’ s relationship with its traditional allies be ?
will formal alli@@ ances such as nato remain the cen@@ ter@@ piece of american strategy , or will they be super@@ se@@ ded by missi@@ on-@@ specific co@@ ali@@ tions ?
third , how much should the us continue to invest in advanced , high-tech weapons more appropriate for conventional enemies than for fighting terrorists or insur@@ g@@ ents ?
systems such as the f / a-@@ 22 rap@@ tor aircraft and the army ’ s future combat system are extraordinarily expensive .
at a time when deplo@@ y@@ ments to iraq and afghanistan are stra@@ ining the defense budget and much of the military ’ s existing equipment needs repair or replacement , questions arise as to whether such programs are a good investment .
fourth , what is the appropriate size of the us military ?
many defense intellec@@ tu@@ als , former military leaders , and politicians believe that america ’ s military , particularly the ground forces , are too small to implement bush ’ s grand strategy .
secretary of defense don@@ ald rum@@ s@@ feld , on the other hand , believes the size of the military is adequate if it is re-@@ organized for maximum efficiency . he is also concerned that an increase in the size of the military will dimin@@ ish funds available for advanced technology and systems .
because rum@@ s@@ feld is the primary architect of the up@@ coming defense review , it is very unlikely to recommend an increase in the size of the force .
the changes underway in american defense policy reflect planning assumptions .
the strategy that emerges will be only as strong as these assumptions are accurate .
the up@@ coming defense review will mandate changes based on events of the past five years , focusing especially on iraq , afghanistan , and other aspects of the war on terror .
the question is whether future american military missions will replicate those of the past five years .
if not , the us might be preparing for the last war rather than the next one .
one hopes that the 2005 defense review will address this issue , although it is certain to answer some strategic questions and leave others open to continued debate .
in any case , the new review will serve as a road@@ map for future us defense policy , thus affecting america ’ s partners and adver@@ sar@@ ies alike .
will the sun still rise ?
tokyo – the scale of the earthquake and tsunami that struck japan in march was far greater than even the authorities ’ worst scenarios fores@@ a@@ w .
nearly six months later , the total damage remains difficult to estimate .
social un@@ rest and con@@ fusion , as well as radiation leaks from the fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma nuclear power plant , continue .
and now the country has absorbed another huge blow : another down@@ grade of its bond ratings .
both moo@@ dy ’ s and standard &amp; poor ’ s now rate japanese bonds at only their four@@ th-@@ highest level .
so what policies should be implemented in response to these economic blows ?
last year , japan ’ s economy grew at a relatively healthy 3 % annual rate , higher than in the united states or the european union , o@@ wing mainly to the fiscal expansion under@@ taken after the collapse of le@@ hman brothers in 2008 .
but growth in 2011 had been predicted to slow even before the earthquake .
indeed , the economy shr@@ ank by 3.5 % year on year in the first quarter .
now , with so much fixed capital and infrastructure destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami , the economy ’ s productive capacity has fallen by an estimated 2 % of gdp .
but that may not be a bad thing : prior to the earthquake , japan had a dem@@ and-@@ supply gap of approximately 5 % of gdp .
while reducing this gap to 3 % of gdp has led to higher prices , this is exactly what japan needs after years of persistent def@@ lation .
meanwhile , higher public spending on capital investment and other special pro@@ cu@@ rements will boost domestic demand .
the han@@ sh@@ in earthquake in 1995 destroyed capital stock worth 2 % of gdp .
this time , the loss is estimated at 3.@@ 4 % of gdp , im@@ plying a larger increase in domestic demand if the right public policies are pursu@@ ed .
on the down@@ side , confidence among consumers and investors alike has taken a hit , mainly o@@ wing to fears about radiation le@@ ak@@ ages and power shor@@ tages .
according to the japan center for economic research , power-@@ supply disrup@@ tions could nega@@ tively affect the japanese economy for the next three years .
if the tokyo metropolitan area ’ s power supply were to decrease by 10 % this year , for example , japan ’ s gdp would fall by 2 % .
soon after the disaster , the government announced that reconstruction demand and higher prices would bring about relatively rapid economic recovery .
i think this view is too optimistic , because i suspect that the government wants to finance its new expen@@ di@@ ture with a tax hi@@ ke .
moreover , the extremely sharp contra@@ ction in first-@@ quarter gdp may indicate that the disaster ’ s negative impact on the economy was more significant than expected .
indeed , the economy is expected to have shr@@ unk by another 2.@@ 6 % year on year in the second quarter , with growth set to res@@ u@@ me only in jul@@ y-@@ september .
and , contrary to the government ’ s out@@ look , the start of economic recovery could be del@@ a@@ yed until the end of this year , with medi@@ um-@@ term annual growth reaching 1.@@ 5@@ - 2 % .
a key question has been the disaster ’ s impact on global supply chains .
according to japan ’ s ministry of economy , trade , and industry , which surve@@ yed firms roughly a month after the earthquake , more than 60 % of production sites in affected areas had already recovered as of april 15 .
almost 30 % expected to recover by the summer , and the remaining 10 % fores@@ a@@ w normal operations after the au@@ tum@@ n .
but the impact of even a small number of disrup@@ tions to supply chains can be highly significant , particularly for the asi@@ a-@@ pacific region .
consider ren@@ es@@ as electronics , a medi@@ um-@@ size company , with ¥ 150 billion ( $ 1.@@ 9 billion ) in annual sales , which accounts for more than half of worldwide production of essential micro-@@ computing components for automobiles .
partly as a result of the damage at ren@@ es@@ as , toyota ’ s capac@@ ity-@@ utili@@ zation rate dropped to 50 % at the beginning of may .
likewise , the chemical manufacturer ku@@ re@@ ha ( ¥ 130 billion in annual sales ) has a 70 % share of the global market for adh@@ esive materials for lithi@@ um-@@ ion batteries – a small but essential component of cell phones .
no@@ ki@@ a in finland , for example , impor@@ ts 12 % of its cell@@ -@@ phone components from japan , and thus could be indi@@ rectly affected by the disaster .
as a result , more companies are likely to create and implement business continuity plans . indeed , “ b@@ cp ” is set to become a key term in the region ’ s economic dis@@ course .
using b@@ c@@ ps to determine alternative producers means that regional economies will be integrated in a new form , with companies establi@@ shing cooperative relationships even with their competitors .
unfortunately , japan ’ s public officials appear in@@ capable of similar flexibility .
the disaster confir@@ med the traditional view of japan as a country that combin@@ es a dynamic private sector with an ane@@ mic public sector and central administration .
the government ’ s mistakes in so-called “ risk communication ” regar@@ ding the fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma nuclear plant , and its slow@@ ness in getting necessary aid to people displaced by the disaster , have once again put the stereot@@ ype on full display .
in terms of international relations , however , the disaster could improve japan ’ s bil@@ ateral ties with influential countries .
for example , chinese premi@@ er wen ji@@ ab@@ ao and south korean president lee my@@ ung@@ -@@ ba@@ k met with out@@ going japanese prime minister na@@ o@@ to kan in fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , near the damaged plant – helping to ease neighbor@@ ing countries ’ concerns about radiation le@@ ak@@ age .
moreover , japan ’ s relations with the us , which had suffered since the democratic party of japan came to power two years ago , appear to have emerged from the disaster stronger than ever .
japan ’ s self-@@ defense forces played an important role in rescue and restor@@ ation activities , with about half of its 200,000 personnel dis@@ pat@@ ched to the damaged area .
while this severely weak@@ ened japan ’ s defen@@ ses , the us en@@ su@@ red east asia ’ s security by deplo@@ ying an aircraft car@@ rier and cru@@ is@@ ers , and american forces also search@@ ed for missing victims together with the j@@ s@@ d@@ f .
but japan ’ s neighbors expect rapid reconstruction and norm@@ alization , and for that , stronger political leadership is needed .
the earthquake and tsunami have confronted japan with a profound crisis – but also with a rare opportunity to under@@ take the comprehensive reforms that the country has post@@ po@@ ned for far too long .
will the us have a “ debt crisis ” ?
washington , dc – john bo@@ e@@ hn@@ er , speaker of the united states house of representatives , is leading the republican party ’ s charge on fiscal policy , arguing that his side needs to see “ trilli@@ ons of dollars ” in spending cuts in order for congress to appro@@ ve an increase in the us government ’ s debt ceiling .
but fra@@ ming the issue this way creates a major problem for bo@@ e@@ hn@@ er : it will directly , completely , and quickly an@@ tag@@ oni@@ ze one of the republicans ’ most important constitu@@ encies – the us corporate sector .
focusing on the debt ceiling creates a political trap for bo@@ e@@ hn@@ er and the republicans .
it is true that the us treas@@ ury ’ s ability to borrow will reach its legally auth@@ orized limit in early august .
it is also true that whenever republicans rat@@ tle their sab@@ ers about the debt ceiling , and threaten not to raise it , the bond market y@@ aw@@ ns and there is no significant impact on yields .
if the republicans ’ threats were credible , any news that increased the likelihood of a problem with the debt ceiling would send treas@@ ury bond prices down and yields up .
this is not happening , because bond tra@@ ders cannot imagine that the republicans would be able – or even willing – to follow through .
the entire credit system in the us – and in much of the rest of the world – is based on the notion that there are “ ris@@ k-@@ free assets , ” namely us government se@@ curi@@ ties .
there is no pro@@ vision in the us constitution to guarantee that the us will always pay its deb@@ ts , but the american republic has proven itself for 200-@@ plus years to be about as good a credit risk as has ever existed .
us fiscal resolve has been tested at least five times : at independence , in the war of 18@@ 12 , during and after the civil war , and in world war i and world war ii .
we can debate the exact fiscal pressures in each case , and precisely how various kinds of bon@@ d@@ holders were treated , but the simple fact of the matter is that when the going gets tough , the us pays its deb@@ ts .
at least in the near term , the chance that the us will not service its debt is van@@ ish@@ ingly small – perhaps in the same order of probability as a large mete@@ or striking the earth .
to be sure , there are big fiscal questions to be sor@@ ted out – including how much the government should spend and on what , as well as how much tax it should collect and by what means .
there is also the v@@ ex@@ ing question of how much debt is too much for the modern us .
in a world where international investors ( from both the private and official sectors ) routinely wr@@ ing their hands about us fiscal defic@@ its – and then go out and buy more us government debt – who knows the answer ?
countries never default because they can ’ t pay their deb@@ ts ; there are always ways to decrease expen@@ di@@ tures or raise taxes .
countries default because their political processes bring them to the point where the people in power decide , for whatever reason , not to pay the government ’ s deb@@ ts .
it is not difficult to identify who would bear what costs if the us did not pay – or if it disrup@@ ted markets by not increasing its debt ceiling .
everyone who bor@@ rows or inter@@ acts with the credit system in any way would suffer a shock that would make the crisis of 2008 look small .
among others , the us corporate sector – big and small business – would be li@@ vid .
to be sure , execu@@ tives and entrepreneurs like to shake their heads over the current us fiscal deficit .
and some of them engage construc@@ tively in deb@@ ates about the real issues : how to control heal@@ th-@@ care costs , prevent future financial crises , and end america ’ s expensive foreign wars .
but these are the issues for the presidential election of 2012 , in which one hopes for deb@@ ates that will set a more encouraging fiscal agenda for the next 20-@@ 30 years .
how and when america ’ s budget problems will be resolved is unknown , but us fiscal history is encouraging – the republic has managed and survived crisis before .
simply put , america will not score an own goal over the debt ceiling – and bo@@ e@@ hn@@ er must know it .
symbolic gestures are to be expected , as with the threatened government shu@@ t@@ down earlier this year , which merely created fo@@ dder for political advertising by both parties .
but any manufactured debt crisis now would deeply an@@ tag@@ oni@@ ze the corporate sector – and most of the elec@@ tor@@ ate .
in the wake of economic disaster , the party held responsible would presumably be ex@@ iled from power for a generation ( the great depression kept the republicans from the us pres@@ iden@@ cy for 20 years ) .
the republican leadership is making threats that are not credible .
if barack obama ’ s administration plays its hand well , the result will be a la@@ st-@@ minute extension of the debt ceiling with no significant conc@@ essions .
it is unclear how bo@@ e@@ hn@@ er or anyone else would be able to portra@@ y that as a political victory .
will the us-@@ japan alliance survive ?
cambridge – next year marks the 50th anniversary of the united stat@@ es-@@ japan security treaty , a central feature of stability in east asia for half a century .
but now , with the japanese experiencing a period of domestic political uncertainty , and north korea ’ s nuclear tests and missile laun@@ ches increasing their anxiety , will japan reverse its long-@@ standing decision not to seek a national nu@@ clear@@ -@@ de@@ terr@@ ent capability ?
is the us-@@ japan alliance coming to an end ?
in the early 1990 ’ s , many americans regarded japan as an economic threat .
some people – in both countries – viewed the security alliance as a cold war reli@@ c to be dis@@ car@@ ded .
these trends were rever@@ sed by the clinton administration ’ s 1995 “ east asia strategy report . ”
in 1996 , the clin@@ ton-@@ has@@ hi@@ mo@@ to declar@@ ation stated that the us-@@ japan security alliance was the foundation for stability that would allow growing prosperity in post-@@ cold war east asia .
that approach has continued on a bi@@ partisan basis in the us , and polls show that it re@@ tains broad acceptance in japan .
most close obser@@ vers of the relationship agree that the us-@@ japan alliance is in much better shape today than 15 years ago .
nonetheless , the alliance faces three major challenges in a new external environment .
one is north korea , whose recent behavior has been clever and decep@@ tive .
the north kore@@ ans have viol@@ ated their agre@@ ements , knowing that china , the country with the greatest potential leverage , is most concerned about regime collapse in north korea , and thus the threat of chaos on its borders .
japan officially end@@ or@@ ses the objective of a non-@@ nuclear world , but it reli@@ es on america ’ s extended nuclear de@@ terr@@ ent , and wants to avoid being subject to nuclear black@@ mail from north korea ( or china ) .
the japanese fear that the credi@@ bility of american extended de@@ terr@@ ence will be weak@@ ened if the us decre@@ ases its nuclear forces to par@@ ity with china .
it is a mistake , however , to believe that extended de@@ terr@@ ence depends on par@@ ity in numbers of nuclear weapons .
rather , it depends on a combination of capability and credi@@ bility .
during the cold war , the us was able to defend berlin because our promise to do so was made credible by the nato alliance and the presence of american troops , whose lives would be on the line in the event of a soviet attack .
indeed , the best guarantee of american extended de@@ terr@@ ence over japan remains the presence of nearly 50,000 american troops ( which japan helps to maintain with generous ho@@ st-@@ nation support ) .
credi@@ bility is also enhanced by joint projects such as the development of regional bal@@ li@@ stic missile defense .
equally important are american actions that show the high priority that the us gives to the alliance , and its guarante@@ es not to engage in what japan fears will be “ japan@@ -@@ passing ” in its relations with asia .
that is why it was so important that us secretary of state hillary clinton ’ s first trip was to asia , and her first stop in japan .
it is also why it is mista@@ ken to speak of a formal g-@@ 2 with china , rather than multi@@ lat@@ eral cooperation .
i responded then ( and today ) that there is little prospect of such a rever@@ sal , for two reasons .
moreover , china ’ s internal evolution remains un@@ certain .
while chinese are more free today than at any time in their history , china ’ s political evolution has la@@ gged behind its economic progress .
unlike india , china has not solved the problem of political participation .
there is always a resi@@ du@@ al danger that china will embrace nation@@ alism to ward off domestic problems .
at the same time , it is in the interest of the us , japan , and china that china ’ s rise be peaceful and harmon@@ i@@ ous ( in the words of chinese leaders ) .
treat china as an enemy , and you guarantee en@@ mity .
that is why the strategy of integration , plus a he@@ dge against uncertainty , makes sense for both the us and japan .
indeed , there are strong grounds for the us , japan , and china to engage in areas of tri@@ lat@@ eral and other regional cooperation .
third , the us-@@ japan alliance will have to face a new set of transnational challenges to our vital interests , such as pande@@ mics , terrorism , and human out@@ flows from failed states .
chief among these challenges is the threat posed by global warming , with china having sur@@ passed the us as the leading producer of carbon-@@ dioxide emissions ( though not in per capita terms ) .
fortunately , this is an area that plays to japan ’ s strengths .
although some japanese complain about the unequal nature of the alliance ’ s security components , o@@ wing to the limits that japan has accepted on the use of force , in these new areas , japan is a stronger partner .
japan ’ s overseas development assistance in places ranging from africa to afghanistan , its participation in global health projects , its support of the united nations , its na@@ val participation in anti-@@ pi@@ racy operations , and its research and development on energy efficiency place it at the fore@@ front in dealing with the new transnational challenges .
given today ’ s agenda , there is enormous potential for an equal partnership , working with others , in the pro@@ vision of global public goods that will benefit the us , japan , and the rest of the world .
that is why i remain optimistic about the future of the us-@@ japan alliance .
will the us “ lose ” latin america ?
on november 4-@@ 5 , the fourth summit of the americas took place in mar del plat@@ a , argentina .
the heads of state of the hemisphere ’ s democratic countries met to discuss economic , political , and social issues – and to lose another opportunity to create a new and healthier relationship between the united states and its latin american neighbors .
indeed , the summit amo@@ unted to nothing more than an out@@ sized photo opportunity .
no important issues were resolved , and no progress was made on the many topics that increasingly divide the countries of latin america and the us .
in particular , no progress was made on the creation of a free-@@ trade area for the region .
this is all the more disap@@ pointing , given that the region ’ s leaders declared more than a decade ago , during the first summit of the americas , held in miami in december 1994 , that free-@@ trade negotiations would be “ concluded no later than 2005 . ”
at the center of the failure to make head@@ way on the creation of the free trade area of the americas ( f@@ ta@@ a ) is america ’ s un@@ willingness , and that of the bush administration , to open up its agricultural sector to competition from countries such as argentina , brazil , and uruguay .
true , the us is not the worst offen@@ der in the world when it comes to farm prote@@ c@@ tion@@ ism ; the european union ’ s trade distor@@ tions are significantly more pervasive .
but it is also true that if the us wants to improve relations with its neighbors to the south , america should make significant bil@@ ateral trade conc@@ essions to the latin american countries .
in the absence of us leadership in matters of international trade , the majority of latin american countries will not open their economies further to foreign competition , and some may even return to increased prote@@ c@@ tion@@ ism .
unfortunately , the lack of progress on trade-@@ related issues is not the only burden on relations between the us and latin america . there are also serious diplo@@ matic and political problems .
very few latin american countries support the iraq war ; indeed , only a handful of small countries in the region contributed troops to the so-called “ coalition of the willing , ” and today only el sal@@ v@@ ad@@ or still has its troops in iraq .
more broadly , most latin american governments are increasingly critical of the bush administration ’ s foreign policy , and they are unlikely to support major initi@@ atives in international for@@ ums , including in the united nations .
moreover , a growing number of latin american countries are ve@@ ering left , and hu@@ go ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z , the bel@@ li@@ ger@@ ent and anti-@@ american venezu@@ el@@ an president , is becoming increasingly popular in every latin american country .
voters across latin america are becoming skeptical of market@@ -@@ oriented policies and globalization , making it more likely that in coming years , and under new leadership , economic policies in the region will be less friendly to foreign investment in general , and to us economic interests in particular .
it is not too late for the us to regain its political and diplo@@ matic influence in latin america .
but improving relations with its neighbors to the south will require making commit@@ ments at several levels .
second , immigration reform in the us should be en@@ acted in a way that protects the rights of lat@@ ino migr@@ ants . and , third , the us should support the demands of latin american countries for a greater say in international institutions such as the world bank and the international mon@@ etary fund .
these initi@@ atives will give the signal to latin american leaders that , despite appear@@ ances to the contrary – including the latest summit of the americas – the region has not been completely negle@@ cted by president bush and the us .
can trum@@ p ’ s san@@ ctions break iran ?
london – “ the iran san@@ ctions have officially been cast , ” twe@@ eted us president don@@ ald trum@@ p three months after he signed an executive order in may announcing his administration ’ s with@@ dra@@ wal from the 2015 iran nuclear deal .
he went on to bo@@ ast the return of “ the most biting san@@ ctions ever imposed , ” as if so@@ unding the death kn@@ ell of the joint comprehensive plan of action ( j@@ c@@ po@@ a ) , as the deal is officially known .
the announcement took few obser@@ vers by surprise .
but the irony was not lost on wen@@ dy sher@@ man , the j@@ c@@ po@@ a ’ s senior us negoti@@ ator , who qui@@ pped recently that she had always expected “ the greatest challenge to the deal ’ s success would be viol@@ ations by iran , not the political machin@@ ations of the president of the united states . ”
indeed , iran and the us seem to have rever@@ sed roles : iran ’ s isolation before the deal now contra@@ sts with america ’ s determination to swim against the global tide .
disap@@ pointment , if not disbelief , prevail@@ ed among the j@@ c@@ po@@ a ’ s other parties – the european union countries , russia , and china – whose leaders were quick to re@@ affir@@ m their strong commitment to the agreement .
by contrast , us officials have reiter@@ ated the trum@@ p administration ’ s determination permanently to rein in iran ’ s “ nuclear ambi@@ tions , ” limit its bal@@ li@@ stic missi@@ les program , and scale down its regional influence .
by the san@@ ctions ’ final stage , which ki@@ cks in on november 4 ( coinci@@ ding , as it happens , with the 3@@ 9@@ th anniversary of the ab@@ du@@ ction of diplo@@ mats and staff at the us embassy in tehran in 1979 ) , the us goal is to reduce iran ’ s oil exports “ down to zero . ”
given the long and frau@@ ght history of economic san@@ ctions against iran , the question lo@@ oming now is whether this time they are more likely to be effective in changing the regime or its behavior .
the last time iran ’ s oil exports were reduced to ne@@ gli@@ gible levels through an extensive economic boy@@ cot@@ t was in the mid-@@ twen@@ tieth century , when iran ’ s popul@@ arly elected prime minister , moham@@ mad mos@@ sa@@ de@@ gh , nation@@ alized the oil industry .
a bri@@ ti@@ sh-@@ led block@@ ade of iran ’ s oil brought the industry to a virtual stand@@ still , dest@@ abili@@ zed the economy , and pa@@ ved the way for the in@@ famous us and u@@ k-@@ inst@@ ig@@ ated coup which restored the shah to power in 1953 .
such has been the han@@ go@@ ver from those tu@@ mul@@ tu@@ ous years that it took a half-@@ century for us secretary of state ma@@ del@@ eine al@@ bright to acknowledge in 2000 that the coup that ou@@ sted mos@@ sa@@ de@@ gh was a clear “ se@@ t@@ back for iran ’ s political development ” and a key reason “ why many iranians continue to res@@ ent this intervention by america . ”
such re@@ mor@@ se , if it can be considered that , did not , however , close the door on more san@@ ctions against iran .
san@@ ctions imposed by the us and the eu from 2010 to 2015 had mixed results . these comprehensive measures – described by th@@ en-@@ us vice president joe bi@@ den as “ the most cri@@ p@@ pling san@@ ctions in the history of san@@ ctions , ” shr@@ ank oil exports by two-thirds , to below one million barrels a day .
the resul@@ ting stag@@ f@@ lation he@@ ap@@ ed misery on ordinary iranians , with gdp contra@@ cting almost 6 % in 2012 and inflation aver@@ aging 35 % the following year .
widespread privat@@ e-@@ sector failures and growing unemployment followed .
contrary to the san@@ ctions ’ principal obje@@ ctives , however , the economic and political hold of the public sector and para@@ stat@@ al organizations streng@@ th@@ ened .
meanwhile , iran insisted on its sovereig@@ n right to pursue a peaceful nuclear program .
the scope for compromise seemed ab@@ sent until the re@@ form@@ ist administration of president has@@ san rou@@ han@@ i took over in 2013 .
so what is different this time ?
though promising to be even more biting , the us san@@ ctions regime is not backed by un security council resol@@ u@@ tions and hence lac@@ ks international legiti@@ macy .
this means iran ’ s isolation will be far less complete , with key trading partners such as china and turkey already announcing that they will ab@@ ide by “ legal ” san@@ ctions only .
but the san@@ ctions ’ de fac@@ to , not de j@@ ure , status will determine their effectiveness .
this is especially true of european firms , which will ultimately decide the outcome of the battle for secondary san@@ ctions in cogni@@ z@@ ance of their share@@ holders ’ interests , rather than the political machin@@ ations of their governments .
this explains the significant stream of ex@@ its from iran ’ s markets already announced by large firms .
in an interconnected world where us economic influence exten@@ ds far and wide , it is hard even for european firms – auto manufacturers , airlines , energy companies , banks , and the like – to risk the ire of the us treas@@ ury .
this means that the ultimate success of san@@ ctions is likely to depend on what others make of them as much as on what iran does .
but domestic conditions in iran also play a key role , and it is here that the us seems to be bas@@ ing its confidence that san@@ ctions will “ succeed . ”
for months , iranian cities have been ro@@ cked by widespread prote@@ sts , o@@ sten@@ si@@ bly against wor@@ sen@@ ing economic conditions .
these out@@ bur@@ sts have weak@@ ened iran ’ s re@@ formers by under@@ mining their monopoly on hope .
hard@@ lin@@ ers , it seems , have been offered a new le@@ ase on life and can now claim their dis@@ mis@@ sal of the j@@ c@@ po@@ a was justi@@ fied from the start .
the economic impact has already been felt , with the iranian currency going into free@@ fall after specu@@ lation about a us with@@ dra@@ wal from the deal began .
the spec@@ ter of inflation is back .
ultimately , for san@@ ctions to succeed from the us perspective , they must bring about either regime change or behavioral change .
historically , san@@ ctions have a less@@ -@@ than@@ -@@ convincing track record ( think cuba , my@@ an@@ mar , and zimbabwe ) on achieving the former , and whether they can pa@@ ve the way for the lat@@ ter , in the form of a negoti@@ ated settlement , remains to be seen .
but one thing is clear : applied to iran , the “ trum@@ p doctrine ” of pushing one ’ s fo@@ es to the br@@ ink , in the hope that they will blink first , has entered un@@ char@@ ted terrain .
will we save the international financial system ?
the world bank and imf have completed their annual meetings , which were gre@@ eted by street demon@@ strations and a pau@@ city of innovative ideas .
here george sor@@ os suggests a bold new t@@ ack to re@@ structure the world &apos;s financial system .
the international financial system is broken down in the sense that it fails to provide adequate capital to countries that need it most and quali@@ fy for it .
global financial markets suck most of the world &apos;s savings to the center , but they fail to pump money back out to the peripher@@ y .
indeed , since 1997 , there has been a reverse flow of capital from countries on the poor peripher@@ y of the world economy to those in the wealthy center .
the facts speak for themselves .
america runs a chronic current account deficit approaching an astonishing 5 % of gdp ; $ 24@@ 2 billion in the first half of this year .
at the same time , brazil - which has followed sound economic policies and has healthy budget and trade sur@@ pl@@ uses - cannot re@@ finance its debt at acceptable rates .
the prevail@@ ing belief that market discipline correc@@ ts such im@@ balances is false , for two reasons .
first , financial markets are inherently unstable .
inst@@ ability arises because financial markets try to dis@@ count a future that depends on their own behavior .
it is now recognized that this can lead to what economists call &quot; multiple equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ a , &quot; but we continue to deny the clear implication that financial markets cannot be left to their own devices .
in practice , of course , international financial markets never have been left to their own devices .
rich countries , led by the us , are in charge .
their primary task is protecting their own interests .
when these countries get into trouble , their authorities intervene for@@ ce@@ fully .
countries that cannot borrow in international markets in their own currency lack that power .
they must turn to the imf , and the imf is more concerned with international financial stability than with enabling developing countries to pursue the counter@@ cycli@@ cal policies needed to avoid recession .
until recently , imf rescue programs were designed to enable deb@@ tor countries to meet their obli@@ ga@@ tions .
taxpa@@ yers in deb@@ tor countries , such as mexico , picked up the ta@@ b .
this may have been unfair , but at least it kept money flowing to the peripher@@ y .
that crisis was attribu@@ ted not to inst@@ ability in the financial markets and the lo@@ p@@ side@@ dness of the system , but to the &quot; moral hazard &quot; introduced by imf ba@@ il-@@ outs .
this lead to a u-@@ turn : from ba@@ il-@@ outs to &quot; ba@@ il-@@ ins , &quot; and to private sector burden sharing .
moral hazard has been cur@@ ta@@ iled but the risks of investing in emerging markets increased .
those risks are now reflected in market prices , which is the source of today &apos;s problem .
what can prevent the situation from de@@ terior@@ ating further and perhaps cul@@ min@@ ating in a systemic crisis ?
in the broad@@ est terms , we must create a more level playing field .
there is nothing wrong with im@@ posing market discipline on countries that follow un@@ sound policies , but the ris@@ k-@@ reward ratio for len@@ ding and investing has shifted too far against the peripher@@ y .
countries that quali@@ fy ought to have access to a len@@ der of last resort and be empowered to pursue counter@@ cycli@@ cal policies .
brazil , for example , confron@@ ts an un@@ ambiguous case of market failure .
although the maximum sustainable real interest rate is about 10 % , brazil &apos;s dollar-@@ denomin@@ ated debt yields 24@@ .@@ 5 % .
a one-@@ year real note pays 27 % .
at these rates , brazil is heading for bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy .
if no len@@ der of last resort en@@ sures that credit is available at or below 10 % , brazil cannot be expected to meet its obli@@ ga@@ tions - dealing a terrible blow both to brazil and the international financial system .
where there is a political will , there is a way .
for instance , the central banks of the us , europe , japan , and britain could accept brazilian paper at their dis@@ count windows .
the imf could guarantee the central banks against market risk at current prices .
this would provide a tremendous boost to the market and dra@@ stically reduce interest rates .
naturally , all guarante@@ es would be condi@@ tional on brazil ab@@ i@@ ding by the imf agreement .
if successful , the imf guarantee would never be inv@@ o@@ ked .
what i propose is novel : it would leverage the imf &apos;s $ 30 billion loan to brazil ten@@ fold ( and set a useful prece@@ dent ) .
unfortunately , such a scheme exce@@ eds the imagination and political will of the imf &apos;s share@@ holders .
but let &apos;s be clear : failure to address the problem could have disa@@ strous consequences .
after all , how would a brazilian default affect mexico ?
addressing the broader , syste@@ m-@@ wide problem , we must find ways to stimulate domestic@@ -@@ led growth in the peripher@@ y countries .
countries that follow sound macro@@ economic policies do not deri@@ ve sufficient economic benefits from doing so .
this generates political dis@@ content that could have ad@@ verse consequences beyond the economic sphere .
at present , the us serves as the motor of the global economy .
but a chronic current account deficit is un@@ sound , unfair , and unsustainable in the long run .
more ur@@ gently , the us motor is spu@@ tter@@ ing .
it would be benefit all parties to start another motor .
to this end , i proposed an annual issue of special drawing rights ( s@@ dr ) that rich countries would don@@ ate for international assistance .
this is a proposal whose time has come because the world economy is ho@@ vering on the br@@ ink of def@@ lation .
until recently , globalization un@@ folded against the background of a global boom ; now we are experiencing a global bear market .
i am afraid globalization may not survive unless we find new ways to stimulate the global economy .
the s@@ dr donation scheme would activate resources that are currently id@@ le , benef@@ iting donors and recipi@@ ents .
it would also reduce the increasing inequality between rich and poor countries .
ukra@@ ine ’ s revol@@ t of the oli@@ g@@ arch@@ s
k@@ yi@@ v – ukra@@ ine ’ s parli@@ am@@ entary election on october 28 will be neither free nor fair .
after eight un@@ productive years since the 2004 orange revolution , the democratic opposition is depressed and demor@@ alized .
even so , the elections may check president vi@@ ktor yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch ’ s power .
yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch came to power in february 2010 , in elections that were r@@ ated free and fair ( and at a time when freedom house still ran@@ ked ukra@@ ine as democratic ) .
but he quickly con@@ soli@@ dated power and turned ukra@@ ine into a mil@@ dly authoritarian state .
a dozen promin@@ ent opposition politicians have been sent@@ enced to prison , including former prime minister yu@@ lia ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ en@@ ko and the former interior minister , y@@ uri lu@@ t@@ sen@@ ko .
ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ en@@ ko , who was and remains the leader of the liberal and pro-@@ western opposition , was sent@@ enced to seven years in prison for a gas deal with russia in which she was not even accused of having benef@@ ited personally .
without her , the democratic opposition has no strong leader .
but yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch has not stopped there .
he exer@@ ts heavy pressure on private television channels , and has blocked licen@@ ses and cable access for the independent television channel t@@ vi , which has exposed the most serious corruption cases of his administration .
moreover , he uses the civil service and la@@ w-@@ en@@ for@@ cement authorities exten@@ sively to repres@@ s the opposition and promote his prot@@ é@@ g@@ és .
and yet the up@@ coming election matters .
ukra@@ ine has a vibrant civil society and excellent free internet media .
but the opposition , which com@@ pris@@ es half the country , is badly demor@@ alized after five years of stal@@ e@@ mate among the orange revolution ’ s leaders , for which the largest share of blame falls on former president vi@@ ktor y@@ us@@ h@@ chen@@ ko , who by almost all accounts has betra@@ yed the democratic breakthrough that he represented .
he now leads a party that supports yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch , who has even allowed y@@ us@@ h@@ chen@@ ko to remain in the presidential residen@@ ce since leaving office .
ukra@@ ini@@ an voters are fi@@ ck@@ le .
they voted against the in@@ cum@@ bent powers in the presidential elections of 1994 , 2004 , and 2010 . they may do so again .
the predat@@ ory nature of yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch ’ s rule is not exactly well hidden ; his family members and loy@@ alists control the entire security apparatus and the main economic agencies .
he is rightly scared by the democratic opposition , which he is ema@@ sc@@ ulating by all reasonably soft means .
anticip@@ ating that his party might lose the up@@ coming election if ukra@@ ine ’ s proportional voting system were main@@ tained , yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch has rever@@ ted to the elec@@ toral system of 2002 , with only half of the 450 seats to be distributed propor@@ tionally .
the remaining 2@@ 25 seats will be filled in w@@ inner@@ -@@ take-@@ all single-@@ member constitu@@ encies – a change that gives regional ty@@ co@@ ons a great opportunity to buy seats .
but yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch failed to anticipate that ty@@ co@@ ons would dare to be dis@@ lo@@ yal to him .
initially , his government contained nine groups of big business@@ men , but that number has fallen gradually , and even top business@@ men have been margin@@ alized by his core loy@@ alists , who are widely ru@@ mor@@ ed to be enrich@@ ing themselves at the expense of both the state and private business .
unlike russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin , yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch seems to have ste@@ am@@ rolled too many too fast , over@@ esti@@ mating his power and nar@@ rowing his base .
indeed , he appears to have turned all of ukra@@ ine ’ s top oli@@ g@@ arch@@ s into his enemies .
each summer , the promin@@ ent ukra@@ ini@@ an business@@ man vic@@ tor pin@@ chu@@ k organi@@ zes a major international conference , the y@@ al@@ ta european strategy , atten@@ ded by the ukra@@ ini@@ an elite and promin@@ ent foreig@@ ners .
this september , the lesson of the conference was that yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch has isolated himself not only from the west and russia , but also from his main back@@ ers at home .
the ukra@@ ini@@ an ty@@ co@@ ons are no fo@@ ols .
they view the up@@ coming election as their last chance to stand up against yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch .
the many parli@@ am@@ ent@@ arians to be elected in single-@@ member constitu@@ encies are more likely to obe@@ y them than yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch .
under the elec@@ toral system in place in 2002 , the rul@@ ing party quickly dis@@ integrated into nine oli@@ g@@ arch@@ ic party fac@@ tions .
the ty@@ co@@ ons might not ou@@ st yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch , but they will check his power .
their most vocal public representatives are first de@@ pu@@ ty prime minister val@@ eri@@ y k@@ hor@@ o@@ sh@@ ko@@ v@@ ski@@ y and the economy minister , pe@@ tro po@@ ro@@ sh@@ en@@ ko , who was a major force behind the orange revolution .
the business@@ men ’ s main obje@@ ction to yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch is that he pre@@ fers to keep ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ en@@ ko in prison rather than ob@@ tain an association agreement with the european union .
the al@@ read@@ y-@@ concluded free-@@ trade agreement with the eu would offer ukra@@ ine badly needed market access and increased exports , but the eu will not rati@@ fy it unless ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ en@@ ko is released and repres@@ sion of the opposition and media ce@@ ases .
similarly , the ty@@ co@@ ons advocate restored cooperation with the international mon@@ etary fund , because they want access to credit at reasonable interest rates .
but yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch ref@@ uses to liber@@ alize gas prices , a key imf demand .
concern that the west ’ s pro-@@ reform stance will push ukra@@ ine into russia ’ s embrace is largely un@@ founded .
yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch ’ s personal relations with pu@@ tin are so poor that pu@@ tin all but ref@@ uses to talk to him – other than to make pre@@ po@@ ster@@ ous demands .
the west thus has an important role to play in the election , and is providing two thousand election monit@@ ors to help to ensure a free and fair vote .
indeed , the united states and the eu , in particular , have a large stake in the outcome .
ukra@@ ine is a friendly country – one that always jo@@ ins western “ co@@ ali@@ tions of the willing . ”
but it is a lap@@ sed democratic country .
they must help to change that .
berlin – when considering climate change , most people think wind turbin@@ es and solar panels are a big part of the solution .
but , over the next 25 years , the contribution of solar and wind power to resol@@ ving the problem will be trivial – and the cost will be enormous .
the international energy agency estimates that about 0.@@ 4 % of global energy now comes from solar and wind .
even in 20@@ 40 , with all governments imple@@ menting all of their green promises , solar and wind will make up just 2.@@ 2 % of global energy .
this is partly because wind and solar help to reduce green@@ house@@ -@@ gas emissions only from electricity generation , which account for 42 % of the total , but not from the energy used in industry , transport , buildings , and agriculture .
but the main reason why wind and solar power cannot be a major solution to climate change ste@@ ms from an almost insur@@ moun@@ table obstacle : we need power when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing .
this has major implications for claims about costs .
for example , wind power , we are repeatedly told , is just about to be cheaper than fossil fuels – or even , as a recent global news story cla@@ imed , that it is now cheaper than fossil fuels in germany and the united kingdom .
this is mostly a mira@@ ge – large-scale wind power will not work anytime soon without subsidies .
as warren buffet says : “ &#91; w &#93; e get a tax credit if we build a lot of wind farms .
that ’ s the only reason to build them .
they don ’ t make sense without the tax credit . ” the ie@@ a estimates that the annual bill for global wind subsidies will increase over the next 25 years , not decrease or fall to zero .
one reason is that cheaper wind in germany and the uk is true only for new construction .
most existing coal and gas suppliers cost about half or less than wind and could run for decades ; instead , we half-@@ close them to accommo@@ date wind .
whereas the new , cheap german win@@ d-@@ energy producers cost $ 80 per m@@ w@@ h ( $ 0.@@ 0@@ 8 per kw@@ h ) , the average german spot price in 20@@ 14 was just $ 33 per m@@ w@@ h .
more important , wind is cheaper only when the wind blows .
when the wind is not blowing , win@@ d-@@ generated electricity is the most expensive electricity of all , because it cannot be bought at any price .
the first wind turbine brings a slightly abo@@ ve-@@ average price per kw@@ h .
but with 30 % market share , since all wind producers sell electricity at the same time ( when the wind blows ) , the electricity is worth only 70 % of the average electricity price .
solar prices drop even faster at similar market shares .
so wind and solar gener@@ ators have to be much cheaper than the average price to be competitive .
moreover , wind and solar make fos@@ sil@@ -@@ fu@@ el-@@ generated electricity more expensive .
some people may think that is a good thing ; but , if our societies are to continue functioning in clou@@ dy , wind@@ less weather , that means rel@@ ying on some fossil fuels .
the ie@@ a estimates that 56 % of electricity will come from fossil fuels in 20@@ 40 , with nuclear and hydr@@ o accounting for another 28 % .
significant wind and solar usage reduces the number of hours gas and coal generation operates ; with large fixed costs , this makes every kw@@ h more expensive .
in a real electricity market , this would result in much higher electricity costs on wind@@ less even@@ ings .
but this is politically problematic , which is why markets are often constructed to spike much less .
in spain , gas plants were used 66 % of the time in 2004 , but only 19 % of the time now , largely because of more wind use .
because the plants must be kept running 57 % of the time to avoid losses , many are likely to close .
keeping the lights on means either accepting much higher prices or em@@ ulating what many european governments are beginning to do – namely , subsidi@@ ze fos@@ sil@@ -@@ fuel plants .
for example , in 20@@ 18 alone , the uk will pay nearly £ 1 billion ( $ 1.5 billion ) , mostly to fos@@ sil@@ -@@ fu@@ el-@@ based gener@@ ators , to keep backup capacity available for peak power usage .
building more wind and solar generating capacity with subsidies means societies end up paying three times for power – once for the power , once for subsidies to inefficient renewables , and once more to subsidi@@ ze our no@@ w-@@ inefficient fossil fuels .
many will say , “ but at least we cut co2 . ”
that is true , although the reduction is perhaps only half of what is often tou@@ ted , because the back@@ -up power needed to smooth inter@@ mitt@@ ent wind and solar is often more co ₂ -@@ heavy .
moreover , we pay de@@ arly for these cuts .
in 2013 , the world produced 6@@ 35 tw@@ h of wind electricity and paid at least $ 28 billion in subsidies , or $ 76 per avoi@@ ded ton of co ₂ , and likely twice or more than that .
when the estimated damage costs of co2 are about $ 5 per ton , and a ton of co2 can be cut in the european union for about $ 10 , we are paying a dollar to do less than 7-@@ 13 cents of good for the climate .
and its positive impact on the climate is ne@@ gli@@ gible .
consider two worlds : in the first , all governments implement all their green promises , as indicated by the ie@@ a , and increase solar and wind energy more than seven-@@ fold by 20@@ 40 ; in the second , not one new solar panel or wind turbine is purch@@ ased over the next 25 years .
the difference in subsi@@ dy spending between the two worlds is more than $ 2.5 trillion .
one day , when the wind price has fallen much further and solar is almost as cheap as wind , significant investments in wind and solar could be a great idea .
but even after decades of capital re@@ allo@@ cation , these sources might account for a bit less than a quarter of our electricity .
in short , a world powered by solar and wind – one that has resolved the climate challenge – is very unlikely anytime soon .
winners and los@@ ers in the post-@@ 9 / 11 era
september 11 , 2001 , is one of those dates that mark a transformation in world politics .
just as the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 , signi@@ fied the cold war ’ s end , al-qaeda ’ s attack on the united states opened a new epo@@ ch .
a non-@@ governmental group killed more americans that day than the government of japan did with its surprise attack on another transformative date , december 7 , 194@@ 1 .
while the ji@@ ha@@ di terrorist movement had been growing for a decade , 9 / 11 was the turning point .
five years into this new era , how should we characteri@@ ze it ?
some believe that 9 / 11 us@@ her@@ ed in a “ clash of civilizations ” between islam v@@ s. the west .
indeed , that is probably what osama bin laden had in mind .
terrorism is a form of theater .
extremi@@ sts kill innocent people in order to dramati@@ ze their message in a way that sho@@ cks and horri@@ fies their intended audience .
they also rely on what clark mc@@ cau@@ ley and others have called “ ju@@ j@@ it@@ s@@ u politics , ” in which a smaller fi@@ ghter uses the strength of the larger oppon@@ ent to defeat him .
in that sense , bin laden hoped that the us would be lu@@ red into a bloody war in afghanistan , similar to the soviet intervention two decades earlier , which had created such a ferti@@ le recru@@ iting ground for ji@@ ha@@ di@@ sts .
but the americans used a modest amount of force to remove the taliban government , avoi@@ ded dis@@ proportion@@ ate civilian casu@@ alties , and were able to create an indigenous political framework .
while far from perfect , the first round in the fight went to the us .
al-qaeda lost the sanctu@@ aries from which it planned its attacks ; many of its leaders were killed or captured ; and its central communications were severely disrup@@ ted .
then the bush administration suc@@ cum@@ bed to hu@@ bris and made the colo@@ s@@ sal mistake of inv@@ ading iraq without broad international support .
iraq provided the symbols , civilian casu@@ alties , and recru@@ iting ground that the ji@@ ha@@ di extremi@@ sts had sought in afghanistan .
iraq was george bush ’ s gift to osama bin laden .
al-qaeda lost its central organi@@ zational capacity , but it became a symbol and focal point around which like@@ -@@ minded imit@@ ators could r@@ ally .
with the help of the internet , its symbols and training materials became easily available around the world .
whether al-qaeda had a direct role in the ma@@ dri@@ d and london bomb@@ ings , or the recent plot to blow up air@@ lin@@ ers over the atlantic , is less important than the way it has been transformed into a powerful “ brand . ”
the second round went to the extremi@@ sts .
the outcome of future ro@@ unds in the struggle against ji@@ ha@@ di terrorism will depend on our ability to avoid the trap of “ ju@@ j@@ it@@ s@@ u politics . ”
that will require more use of the soft power of attraction rather than rel@@ ying so heavily on hard military power , as the bush administration has done .
for the struggle is not a clash of islam v@@ s. the west , but a civil war within islam between a minority of terrorists and a larger mainstream of non-@@ violent belie@@ vers .
ji@@ ha@@ di extremism cannot be defeated unless the mainstream wins .
military force , intelligence , and international police cooperation needs to be used against hard@@ core terrorists aff@@ ili@@ ated with or inspired by al-qaeda , but soft power is essential to attra@@ cting the mainstream and dr@@ ying up support for the extremi@@ sts .
us secretary of defense don@@ ald rum@@ s@@ feld once said that the measure of success in this war is whether the number of terrorists we are killing and de@@ terr@@ ing is larger than the number that the terrorists are recru@@ iting .
by this standard , we are doing badly .
in november 2003 , the official number of terrorist insur@@ g@@ ents in iraq was given as 5,000 .
this year , it was reported to be 20,000 .
as bri@@ g. general robert cas@@ len , the pentagon ’ s de@@ pu@@ ty director for the war on terrorism , put it , “ we are not killing them faster than they are being created . ”
we are also failing in the application of soft power .
according to cas@@ len , “ we in the pentagon are behind our adver@@ sar@@ ies in the use of communication – either to recruit or train . ”
the manner in which we use military power also affects rum@@ s@@ feld ’ s ratio .
in the after@@ math of 9 / 11 , there was a good deal of sympathy and understanding around the world for america ’ s military response against the taliban .
the us invasion of iraq , a country that was not connected to the 9 / 11 attacks , squ@@ ander@@ ed that good will , and the attra@@ c@@ tiveness of the us in muslim countries like indonesia plum@@ me@@ ted from 75 % approval in 2000 to half that level today .
indeed , occu@@ p@@ ying a divided nation is messy , and it is bound to produce episo@@ des like abu ghraib and ha@@ di@@ tha , which under@@ cut america ’ s attra@@ c@@ tiveness not just in iraq , but around the world .
when the soviet union invaded hung@@ ary and c@@ ze@@ cho@@ slo@@ v@@ ak@@ ia during the cold war , it under@@ cut the soft power that it had enjoyed in europe in the after@@ math of world war ii .
when israel launched a l@@ eng@@ thy bom@@ bing campaign in lebanon last month , it created so many civilian casu@@ alties that the early cri@@ tic@@ is@@ ms of he@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h by egypt , jordan , and saudi arabia became un@@ ten@@ able in arab politics .
when terrorist ex@@ cess@@ es killed innocent muslim civili@@ ans such as egyptian islamic jihad did in 1993 or abu mus@@ ab al-@@ zar@@ q@@ awi did in am@@ man in 2005 , they under@@ cut their own soft power and lost support .
the most important lesson five years after 9 / 11 is that failure to combine hard and soft power effectively in the struggle against ji@@ ha@@ di terrorism will lead us into the trap set by those who want a clash of civilizations .
muslims , including islam@@ ists , have a diversity of views , so we need to be war@@ y of strategies that help our enemies by un@@ iting disparate forces behind one ban@@ ner .
we have a just cause and many potential allies , but our failure to combine hard and soft power into a smart strategy could be fatal .
the middle east ’ s lost decade
berlin – the united states has wa@@ ged three wars since al qaeda ’ s terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 : against al qaeda , in afghanistan , and in iraq .
the first two were forced upon the us , but the third was the result of a will@@ ful , deliber@@ ate decision by former president george w. bush , taken on ideological grounds and , most likely , for personal reasons as well .
had bush , former vice president dick chen@@ ey , former secretary of defense don@@ ald rum@@ s@@ feld , and their ne@@ oc@@ on allies been for@@ th@@ right about their intentions – to bring down saddam hussein by means of war , thereby creating a new , pro-@@ western middle east – they never would have received the support of congress and the american public . their vision was both naive and reck@@ less .
so a threat – ira@@ qi weapons of mass destruction – had to be created . as we now know , the threat was based on lies ( aluminum tubes for a nu@@ clear@@ -@@ weapons program , for example , meetings between the 9 / 11 plot leader , mohamed at@@ ta , and ira@@ qi officials in pra@@ gue , and even gl@@ aring for@@ geries like supposed ira@@ qi orders for yellow@@ cake uranium from niger ) .
such were the justi@@ fi@@ cations for a war that was to claim the lives of almost 5,000 us soldiers and more than 100,000 ira@@ q@@ is .
add to that the millions more who were injured and displaced from their homes , as well as the destruction of one of the world ’ s oldest christian communities .
for this , the us alone spent up to $ 3 trillion .
bush ’ s war against saddam did radically change the middle east , though not as he en@@ vis@@ aged . for star@@ ters , if the us had set out to dest@@ abili@@ ze iraq , its efforts could hardly have been more successful : ten years later , the country ’ s vi@@ ability as a single state has never been in greater doubt .
with saddam gone , iraq ’ s shi@@ a majority assumed power after a horr@@ end@@ ous civil war , leaving iraq ’ s defeated sun@@ nis longing for reven@@ ge and waiting for an opportunity to regain their ascen@@ dan@@ cy .
the kur@@ ds in the north clever@@ ly and ade@@ p@@ tly used the window of opportunity that opened before them to sei@@ ze de fac@@ to independence , though the key question of control over the northern city of kir@@ ku@@ k remains a ticking time bomb .
taking stock of “ operation ira@@ qi freedom ” a decade later , the financial times concluded that the us won the war , iran won the peace , and turkey won the contracts .
i can only agree .
in political terms , iran is the big winner of bush ’ s war .
its num@@ ber-@@ one enemy , saddam , was dis@@ pat@@ ched by its num@@ ber-@@ two enemy , the united states , which presented iran with a golden opportunity to extend its influence beyond its western border for the first time since 17@@ 46 .
bush ’ s war , with its poor strategic vision and worse planning , increased iran ’ s regional standing in a way that the country was unlikely ever to have achieved on its own .
the war enabled iran to ass@@ ert itself as the dominant power in the gulf and the wider region , and its nuclear program serves precisely these ambi@@ tions .
the los@@ ers in the region are also clear : saudi arabia and the other gulf states , which feel existenti@@ ally threatened , and have come to regard their own shi@@ a min@@ orities as an iranian fifth column .
they have a point : with the shi@@ a in power in iraq , iran will seek suitable opportunities to use local shi@@ a populations as prox@@ ies to ass@@ ert its he@@ ge@@ mon@@ ic claims .
this is what is fu@@ eling ba@@ h@@ rain ’ s domestic tur@@ mo@@ il , beyond the shi@@ a majority ’ s local gri@@ ev@@ ances .
leaving aside the lies , fi@@ ctions , and questions of morality and personal responsibility , the critical mistake of america ’ s war against iraq was the absence of either a viable plan or the necessary strength to en@@ force a pa@@ x americ@@ ana in the middle east .
america was powerful enough to dest@@ abili@@ ze the existing regional order , but not powerful enough to establish a new one .
the us neo@@ con@@ s , with their wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking , gross@@ ly under@@ estimated the scale of the task at hand – unlike the revolution@@ aries in iran , who quickly moved in to re@@ ap what the us had so@@ wed .
the iraq war also marked the beginning of america ’ s subsequ@@ ent relative decline .
bush squ@@ ander@@ ed a large part of america ’ s military strength in mes@@ opo@@ tam@@ ia for an ideological fiction – strength that is sor@@ ely missed in the region ten years later .
and there is no alternative to be seen without america .
while there is no cau@@ sal link between the iraq war and the arab revolutions that began in december 2010 , their implications have combined in a mal@@ ign manner .
since the war , the bitter en@@ mi@@ ties between al qaeda and other sal@@ af@@ ist and sun@@ ni arab nation@@ alist groups have given way to cooperation or even mer@@ gers .
this , too , is a result brought about by the american ne@@ oc@@ on master@@ minds .
and the regional dest@@ abili@@ zation triggered by the arab revolutions is increasingly conver@@ ging on iraq , mainly via syria and iran .
indeed , the gra@@ v@@ est current danger to the region is a process of national dis@@ integration eman@@ ating from the sy@@ rian civil war , which is threatening to spread not only to iraq , but also to lebanon and jordan .
what makes syria ’ s civil war so dangerous is that the players on the ground are no longer its driving forces .
winning at corporate governance
cambridge : despite nas@@ da@@ q crashes and the threat of us recession , the new economy is here to stay .
indeed , it remains the key to improved performance in europe and japan in the years ahead .
but where , exactly , does the heart of the new economy lie ?
is it in more competitive labor markets or in better tax systems or in deregu@@ lation ?
corporate governance , too , is a motor of the new economy that should not be under@@ r@@ ated .
if managers create productive , flexible structures focused on wealth creation , companies find it easy to adjust and explore new sources of productivity and cost control .
if de@@ centr@@ alization and risk taking are part of a company ’ s mission , innovation in products and processes is certain to take place .
if , on the contrary , bos@@ ses behave like cau@@ tious execu@@ tors of a wealthy estate , their companies will soon look like museums .
a country ’ s economic performance , indeed , is a mirror image of its resi@@ dent companies .
countries with great companies show great performance .
where then are the great companies of the world to be found ?
no surprise that more than half of the most respected companies are american .
although europe is roughly the same economic size as the us , it has far fewer winning corporate teams .
japan may be much smaller than america or europe , but it under@@ performs its share of g@@ 7 income or wealth .
the picture could not be clear@@ er : the us economy performs stun@@ n@@ ingly , as does its corporate sector ; europe is far behind ; and japan does not really register .
pe@@ ering into the future of this premi@@ er league of companies five years from now , the ft sees a number of shifts as likely , with europe catching up , japan losing even more ground , and america giving up some ground , too .
this glimpse into the future mirrors today ’ s perceptions of a ma@@ turing ( a co@@ de-@@ word for losing its edge ) american economy and a europe able to play cat@@ ch@@ -up because the new business culture is at last taking hold .
this survey also accurately reflects the reality that very few japanese firms are succe@@ eding at the hard task of re@@ struc@@ turing , of shifting to modern , world-class governance .
world-class sony stays ahead ; n@@ tt ( its do@@ com@@ o subsidi@@ ary is the key here ) holds on , but old and tired hon@@ da and ma@@ ts@@ us@@ hit@@ a are likely to be rele@@ gated to second class status .
the dynamics of the next 5 years will also reflect a head-@@ on competition between winning corporations .
boeing versus air@@ bus may be the most interesting example .
in the current r@@ ank@@ ings , both are locked in a clin@@ ch close to the bottom of the ft list of top firms .
in 5 years , however , air@@ bus will likely be up and boeing out of the champi@@ ons league altogether .
why ?
air@@ bus has looked ahead , invested , and is bringing on a new jum@@ bo jet that will make boeing ’ s existing products look out@@ dated and inefficient .
for boeing became com@@ plac@@ ent and forgot that the airline business is a cu@@ t-@@ throat world .
when thinking about economic potential , we tend to look at the quality of the labor force , a people ’ s willingness to work , and the level of education .
seen from this perspective , europe and japan should tro@@ un@@ ce the us because of their far superior basic education systems , and japanese discipline make europeans look lazy .
in fact , effort and education are not what matters most .
far more significant is the economic environment in which people work – a market economy versus some form of soci@@ alism – and the organization of businesses in which they participate .
the best model of corporate governance to produce strong and lasting economic performance remains to be found .
in the 1980s , respect for the long-@@ run view of the japanese model ran high .
this is no longer so because of japan ’ s economic mal@@ a@@ ise .
then there was the flir@@ tation with the german model of business-@@ banking integration , which brings capital markets in-@@ house .
that lost its attraction when it became clear that co@@ zy relations between bankers and bos@@ ses result in tolerance for poor rates of return on capital .
now the us model is in : decentralized , lean on middle management , tough on the ceo ; and with a “ don ’ t take no for an answer ” code .
but this won ’ t be the last answer , although for the time being it will drive corporate re@@ struc@@ turing and the mana@@ geri@@ al mind .
all this beg@@ s the question as to whether it makes sense to change corporate cultures every 10 or 20 years .
the pragmatic answer is that it takes very different models to handle a stable and sta@@ tionary world as opposed to a world in which deregu@@ lation and technology produce dramatic change daily .
the us model works in times of rapid , pervasive change .
this is what lies ahead for the fores@@ ee@@ able future .
hold on tight .
winning over globalization ’ s los@@ ers
on both sides of the atlantic , many view economic globalization as a threat to belo@@ w-@@ average ear@@ ners .
according to a recent poll by the german marshall fund , maj@@ orities in france , germany , and the united states favor maintaining existing trade barriers , even if doing so ham@@ pers economic growth .
clearly , the large net gains from global economic integration are not enough to convince those who have lost their jobs and the many others who feel at risk .
the recently established european globalization adju@@ st@@ ment fund ( eg@@ f ) is an eu@@ -@@ wide response to this challenge .
the eg@@ f can spend up to € 500 million annu@@ ally in eu member states on workers affected by trade-@@ induced la@@ yo@@ ffs .
but sharing the benefits of globalization with the los@@ ers is traditionally regarded as a national responsibility .
for example , the inspiration for the eg@@ f , america ’ s trade adju@@ st@@ ment assistance , introduced by the kennedy administration in 1962 , is a purely national scheme .
is eu involvement really justi@@ fied ?
the economic case for a european globalization fund is that trade policy has been dele@@ gated to the european level , while union members retain control rights to block decisions .
consider the hypothetical example of full trade liber@@ alization in tex@@ tiles , which would have greatly asym@@ metric effects between , say , sweden , with hardly any textile industry , and portugal , with a substantial one .
sweden would be a clear bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ ary while portugal would be hit hard , o@@ wing to the large number of displaced textile workers .
the negative impact of such redund@@ an@@ cies is serious .
oecd statistics show that 40 % to 50 % of displaced manufacturing workers in the eu@@ 15 remain without a job 24 months after becoming unemployed .
around 30 % work in a job that pays less than the previous one .
only around one-@@ quarter are re-@@ employed with a wage at or above the previous level ( see chart ) .
manufacturing workers 24 months after la@@ yo@@ ff in the eu@@ 15
source : oecd
although sweden , for example , would be a net contribu@@ tor to the eg@@ f , it might well be a net bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ ary of the arrangement as a whole .
in principle , a web of bil@@ ateral transfer arrangements could achieve such an un@@ blocking of trade .
nevertheless , the eg@@ f ’ s rules need to be ti@@ ghten@@ ed , lest the scheme comes to be regarded as a political gi@@ mmi@@ ck .
the current se@@ tup leaves too much room for discre@@ tion , as neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for aid are clearly sp@@ elled out .
this will expose the eg@@ f to waste@@ ful political post@@ uring and lo@@ bb@@ ying by countries and sectors .
the eg@@ f ’ s rules should be am@@ ended to ensure that governments and trade-@@ displaced workers receive transparent , visible , and reliable assistance , as well as to spread best practice in active labor market policy .
displaced workers often face unemployment , a lower@@ -@@ paying job , or a new job far from home . of these , the unemployed typically receive most public support .
to address this distor@@ tion head on , and to provide clarity concern@@ ing the allo@@ cation of funds , the eg@@ f should focus its limited funds on two simple active labor market programs : wage insurance and mobility allo@@ wan@@ ce .
wage insurance could offer workers whose pay was cut after dis@@ placement compen@@ sation for up to two years amo@@ unting to half the difference between the old and the new wage .
the mobility allo@@ wan@@ ce could offer those moving for a new job a lum@@ p-@@ sum payment of two months ’ gross pay in the previous job , or four months ’ pay for cross-@@ border moves .
the very simplicity of this scheme will likely ensure high visi@@ bility and reasonable take@@ -up rates .
the down@@ side of such a focused approach is also clear : the margin of choice for eu members about how eg@@ f funds are to be spent in their country would be minimal .
in view of the likely advantages , this might be acceptable if member states could be assu@@ red that , if the sch@@ emes work , it will be expanded .
this can be done as part of a reform of the european social fund , which has an annual budget of around € 10 billion – twenty times the current funding of the eg@@ f .
if the eg@@ f does not prove effective , the money can simply be given back to the eu budget or to member states .
but if the eg@@ f does work , the benefits would far out@@ weigh the costs .
winning the confidence game
new haven – on april 2 , the g-@@ 20 will hold a summit in london to discuss what we may hope will be an internation@@ ally coordinated plan to address the world economic crisis .
but can such a plan really work ?
people everywhere , consumers and investors alike , are can@@ cel@@ ing spending plans , because the world economy seems very risky right now .
the same thing happened during the great depression of the 19@@ 30 ’ s .
a contemporary observer , win@@ thro@@ p case , explained it all in 193@@ 8 : economic revi@@ val depended “ on the willingness of individual and corporate bu@@ yers to make purch@@ ases that necessarily tie up their resources for a consider@@ able length of time .
for the individual , this impli@@ es confidence in the job , and in the end comes equally back to the confidence of industry leaders . ” unfortunately , confidence did not return until world war ii ended the depression .
if the leaders meeting in london are to succeed where governments failed in the 19@@ 30 ’ s , they must commit themselves to a fiscal target that is sufficient to restore full employment under normal credit conditions .
they must also commit themselves to a credit target that will restore len@@ ding to normal .
people will not spend normally unless they have both a job and normal access to credit .
during the great depression , such targets were not used on a large enough scale , merely fu@@ eling public despair that stimulus policies would ever work .
the g-@@ 20 summit should also be an occasion for affir@@ ming some basic principles .
people need to believe that the money represents something more lasting than stimulus measures , which may eventually end in failure .
after all , the great depression did not end simply because of the massive stimulus of war@@ -@@ related expen@@ di@@ tures .
why should world war ii have produced any confidence in the future ?
to be sure , world war ii reduced the unemployment rate in the united states dramatically , from 15 % in 1940 to 1 % in 194@@ 4 , and had a similar effect in other countries .
but this was not because of a revi@@ val in business confidence . it was because of a nasty war , plain and simple , with people dra@@ fted into fighting , or into industries sup@@ plying the war effort .
the real recovery of confidence did not occur until after world war ii , when the world did not sink back into depression .
the us council of economic advis@@ ors war@@ ned of this possibility in 1949 , and it was not alone .
there appears to be more than one reason why , on the contrary , confidence came ro@@ aring back .
first , there was a general perception of “ pent@@ -up demand . ”
after years of pri@@ vation ( and in many countries the physical destruction of war ) , people just wanted to live normally – to rebuild , own a home , a car , and other consumer goods .
the widespread impression that there was such pent@@ -up demand also led people to believe that there could not be another depression .
the perception of pent@@ -up demand was like a powerful economic stimulus package , and it had the advantage that people believed it would be long-@@ lasting .
indeed , the same long-term confidence triggered the post-@@ war “ baby boom . ”
according to some contemporary obser@@ vers , however , “ pent@@ -up demand ” was only part of the story .
during the brief but deep recession of 1949 , the financial comm@@ ent@@ ator sil@@ via por@@ ter reflected on the attitudes that led to the 1929 crash : “ we saw nothing wrong – in fact , we saw everything right – with the wild specu@@ lative boom and credit inflation that … cul@@ min@@ ated in the now almost unbelievable gam@@ bling or@@ gy of 1929 . ”
but now , por@@ ter wrote , after the depression and war , “ we began to listen to the idea that a hundred million citizens , acting through a central government , could achieve much more than a hundred million acting as separate selfish units .
we developed , in short , a new attitude toward the responsibilities of government . ” she concluded that the positive effect of “ pent@@ -up demand ” and government measures can “ make sense only when viewed against the background of our changed economic and political philosophy . ”
the marshall plan , which operated from 1947 to 195@@ 1 , became a symbol of this new attitude .
the us gave billions of dollars of aid to rebuild war@@ -@@ ra@@ va@@ ged countries in europe .
the plan was widely viewed as reflecting a new kind of enlightenment , a recognition of the importance of supporting people who needed help .
europe would not be allowed to langu@@ ish , and the stimulus came from abroad .
after the war , ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian economic theory , which was generally not accepted or understood during the great depression , became the basis of a new social compact .
it was a theory that was perfectly su@@ ited to a generation that had just en@@ du@@ red exceptional sacrifi@@ ces , for it re@@ affir@@ med a belief in our responsibility for each other .
the effect of economic stimulus is re@@ doubled by this kind of inspirational belief .
that is why all of the commit@@ ments made and intentions expressed at the up@@ coming g-@@ 20 summit matter .
the countries represented must show a generous spirit and make the world economy work for all people .
seemingly peripher@@ al issues , like aid to the developing world and the poor , who suffer the most from a crisis like this one , will be part of the primary story of the renew@@ al of confidence , just as the marshall plan was part of that story after world war ii .
winning the european confidence game
chicago – if any solution to the european crisis proposed over the next few days is to restore confidence to the sovereig@@ n-@@ bond markets , it will have to be both economically viable and politically pal@@ at@@ able to rescu@@ ers and rescued alike .
this means paying attention not just to the plan ’ s technical details , but also to appear@@ ances .
there is growing consensus about any solution ’ s key elements .
first , italy and spain will have to come up with credible medi@@ um-@@ term plans that will not just restore their fiscal health , but also improve their ability to grow their way out of trouble .
while any plan will involve pain for citizens , the markets must de@@ em the pain politically toler@@ able , at least relative to the alternatives .
it is important that these plans be seen as domest@@ ically de@@ vised ( though voters will have no illusions about the external and market pressures that have forced their governments to act ) .
at the same time , an external agency such as the international mon@@ etary fund could render the plan more credible by evalu@@ ating it for consisten@@ cy with the country ’ s goals and monitoring its imple@@ mentation .
second , some vehicle – the imf or the european financial stability facility , with either entity funded directly by countries or the european central bank – has to stand ready to fund borrowing by italy , spain , and any other potentially dist@@ ressed countries over the next year or two .
but there is an important ca@@ ve@@ at , which has largely been ignored in public discussions : if this funding is senior to private debt ( as imf funding typically is ) , it will be harder for these countries to regain access to markets .
after all , the more a country bor@@ rows in the short term from official sources , the further back in line it pushes private credi@@ tors .
that makes private len@@ ders susceptible to larger hair@@ cuts if the country eventually de@@ faul@@ ts – and thus more hes@@ it@@ ant to l@@ end in the first place .
in other words , private markets need to be convinced both that there is a low probability of default ( hence the importance of credible plans ) , and that there is some additional los@@ s-@@ bearing capacity in the new funding , so that , if there is a default , out@@ standing or ro@@ l@@ led-@@ over private debt does not have to bear the full br@@ unt .
this may seem unfair .
why should the taxpa@@ yer accept a loss when they are ba@@ iling out the private sector by providing new funding ?
in an ideal world , dist@@ ressed countries would default as soon as private markets stopped funding them , and they would impose the losses on private bon@@ d@@ holders .
in the real world , however , if italy and spain are viewed as being sol@@ vent , or too big to fail , official funding should be structured so that it gives these countries their best chance to regain market confidence .
this does not mean that official funding should be junior to private debt in any re@@ struc@@ turing , for that would require substan@@ tially more los@@ s-@@ bearing capacity from the official sector – capacity that is probably not available .
indeed , if official funding were junior , it would be providing a larger cus@@ hi@@ on to private credi@@ tors – and thus ba@@ iling them out to an even greater extent .
the simplest solution is to treat official funding no differently from private debt – best achieved if official len@@ ders buy sovereig@@ n bonds as they are issued ( possibly at a pre@@ determined yield ) and agree to be treated on p@@ ar with private credi@@ tors in a re@@ struc@@ turing .
as the country re@@ gains market confidence , the official funding can be reduced , and eventually the bonds can be sold back to the markets .
the bottom line is that official funding must be accompanied by los@@ s-@@ bearing capacity .
if the funding is channel@@ ed through the imf , and is to be treated on p@@ ar with private debt , the fund will need a guarantee from the ef@@ sf or strong euro@@ zone countries that it will be inde@@ m@@ ni@@ fied in any re@@ struc@@ turing .
of course , the imf ’ s member states might be willing to accept some burden sharing if a sufficient bu@@ ffer provided by the euro@@ zone were ero@@ ded , but that cannot be taken for granted .
once the first two elements of the plan are in place , there should be little need for the third – bond purch@@ ases by the ec@@ b in the secondary market in order to narrow interest@@ -@@ rate spreads and provide further confidence .
indeed , if the ec@@ b inten@@ ds to claim prefer@@ red-@@ credi@@ tor status for any bonds that it buys , it is probably best that it buy very few .
of course , the ec@@ b will have to continue to provide support to banks until confidence about their hol@@ dings returns .
but there is one more element that is needed to assure markets that the solution is politically viable .
citizens across europe , whether in rescued countries or rescu@@ ing countries , will be paying for years to clean up a mess for which they were not responsible .
not all banks volun@@ t@@ arily loaded up on dist@@ ressed government bonds – some were pres@@ su@@ red by super@@ vis@@ ors , others by governments – but many have made un@@ wise be@@ ts .
if they are seen as prof@@ iting un@@ du@@ ly from the rescue , even as they return to their bad old ways of paying for non-@@ performance , they will under@@ mine political support for the rescue – and perhaps even for capitalism .
cri@@ es that this is not capitalism should be met with a firm ret@@ ort : “ nor are bail@@ outs ! ”
winning the peace
afghanistan ’ s future hangs in the balance as its weak national government strug@@ gles to maintain support and legiti@@ macy in the face of a wi@@ dening insur@@ gency , war@@ lords , the heroin trade , and a disappointed popul@@ ace .
across an arc extending from afghanistan to east africa , violence now also sur@@ ges in iraq , lebanon , somalia , and beyond , to sudan ’ s darfur region .
everywhere , politicians , gener@@ als , and even diplo@@ mats talk of military strategies and maneu@@ vers , but everywhere something utterly different is needed .
stability will come only when economic opportunities exist , when a bul@@ ging generation of young men can find jobs and support families , rather than seeking their fortune in violence .
we are seeing again and again that a foreign army , whether nato ’ s in afghanistan , america ’ s in iraq , israel ’ s in occupied palestine , or ethiopia ’ s in somalia , may win a battle , or even a war , but never the peace .
peace is about dignity and hope for the future .
military occupation sa@@ ps dignity , and grin@@ ding poverty and economic dis@@ array sa@@ p hope .
peace can be achieved only with a with@@ dra@@ wal of foreign troops , and the arri@@ val of jobs , productive farms and factories , tourism , health care , and schools .
without these , military victory and occupation quickly turn to ashes .
the united states government has proven itself blind to these facts , but the international community also remains ill equipped to ass@@ ist in the restor@@ ation of peace following conflicts in im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
repeatedly , a fragile peace has broken down because of the lack of economic follo@@ w-@@ up .
despite grand promises of foreign aid , economic reconstruction , and development in afghanistan , iraq , lebanon , and elsewhere , the actual record of international assistance to post-@@ war reconstruction is gra@@ vely defi@@ cient .
the scenario has become pain@@ fully familiar .
a war ends .
an international donors ’ conference is called .
ple@@ dges of billions of dollars are announced .
a smiling new head of state gra@@ ci@@ ously thanks the international community , including the occu@@ p@@ ying power .
months pass .
world bank teams from washington start to arrive .
but actual reconstruction and recovery is del@@ a@@ yed , perhaps for years .
cr@@ ony businesses from the us and europe , which are utterly un@@ familiar with local conditions , squ@@ ander time , aid funds , and opportunities .
two or three years pass .
the grand pronoun@@ c@@ ements become a pile of out-of-@@ date world bank studies .
rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ations fly , the occu@@ p@@ ying army remains , and a new insur@@ gency spreads .
many factors contribute to this dis@@ array , beginning with the shocking inability of the us , europe , and the international organizations to understand things from the perspective of poor and displaced people .
their lack of empathy is de@@ pl@@ orable , but there are conceptual problems as well .
the international agencies involved in post-conflict reconstruction have so far failed to understand how to start or re@@ start economic development in a low-income setting .
it ’ s important to distinguish four distinct phases of outside help to end a conflict .
in the first phase , during the war itself , aid is for humanitarian relief , focusing on food , water , emergency medicine , and refugee camps .
in the second phase , at the war ’ s end , aid remains mainly humanitarian relief , but now directed towards displaced people returning home , and to de@@ commissioned soldiers .
in the third phase , lasting three to five years , aid supports the first phase of post-@@ war economic development , including restor@@ ation of schools , clinics , farms , factories , and ports .
in the fourth phase , which can last a generation or more , assistance is directed to long-term investments and the streng@@ th@@ ening of institutions such as courts .
the international community , and the us in particular , is dread@@ ful at the third stage .
once a conflict is over , aid agencies seem paralyzed .
instead of sending help , they send study groups .
by the time such help actually arri@@ ves , it is often too late : war has been re-@@ ig@@ ni@@ ted .
in fact , it is possible to re@@ start economic development through targeted “ quick@@ -@@ impact ” initi@@ atives .
since the economies of most im@@ pover@@ ished post-conflict countries are based on agriculture , re@@ starting farm output is vital .
im@@ pover@@ ished farmers should receive a free package of seeds , fertilizers , and low-cost equipment ( such as pumps for irrigation ) .
when such aid is made available quickly , former soldiers will return to their farms , and can establish a live@@ lihood by the beginning of the first growing season following the end of hosti@@ li@@ ties .
this type of aid does not require long studies , but quick action .
similar quick@@ -@@ impact measures should be under@@ taken to control disease .
small rural clinics can be built or re@@ built very quickly , within the first year of peace .
solar panels and wind turbin@@ es can provide off-@@ grid power in isolated rural areas . wells and ci@@ sterns can be put in place to ensure safe drinking water .
these and similar efforts can mean the difference between famine and food security , epidemic disease and health , income and utter poverty , and , most importantly , hope and despair .
yet the window of opportunity clo@@ ses quickly .
quick@@ -@@ impact economic development is exactly what is needed now to help end the horrific violence and suffering in darfur .
san@@ ctions , threats , and peace@@ keepers are only short-term measures , whereas real progress there against extreme poverty is not only achie@@ vable , but also is something that the government and rebel@@ s can agree on .
the same applies in somalia .
but the window of opportunity clo@@ ses quickly in these and other post-conflict regions .
only by taking quick , meaningful action to fight hunger , poverty , and disease can there be a chance of creating conditions for long-term peace .
winning the transition
washington , dc – is the arab spring turning into a glo@@ omy au@@ tum@@ n ?
with brutal cra@@ ck@@ downs in syria , a bloody civil war in libya , and yemen tee@@ tering on the br@@ ink of chaos , the number of skep@@ tics is growing .
although egypt and tunisia ’ s pro-@@ democracy movements achieved rapid regime change , un@@ certain@@ ties remain in those countries , too .
after a brief period of hope , many obser@@ vers now wonder whether the region is capable of producing viable , and economically vibrant , democracies .
revolutions and their after@@ ma@@ ths , of course , are always fluid and fi@@ ck@@ le times , and the outcome is often per@@ ched on a knife ’ s edge .
brid@@ ging the vast gap between high expectations and the reality of limited budgets and capabilities is a test in itself .
red@@ ressing past injustice and building an economy that offers opportunity to all are major challenges as well , frau@@ ght with vola@@ tili@@ ty , uncertainty , and the dangers of political opport@@ un@@ ism .
but transi@@ tions are also times of great opportunity .
in the 1990 ’ s , i was among those indones@@ ians who demand@@ ed and celebrated the de@@ par@@ ture of our own auto@@ crat , su@@ har@@ to , and i joined the new government when he left .
many obser@@ vers predicted that indonesia , the world ’ s most popul@@ ous muslim country , would be unable to sustain democracy and would ultimately decline into chaos .
the task ahead of us was daunting .
but we proved the skep@@ tics wrong , and learned some fundamental lessons .
perhaps most importantly , we learned that there is no one-@@ si@@ ze-@@ fit@@ s-@@ all solution for democra@@ tization .
each of the countries of the middle east and north africa will face unique challenges , which will have to be addressed on their own terms .
even so , they all must make a real and symbolic break with the past .
the new authorities must send strong signals that the old ways are finished .
change must be form@@ ally manifest@@ ed , with new laws that are widely publi@@ ci@@ zed .
legislation that em@@ powers citizens with freedom of expression , free and independent elections , and freedom of association is crucial , and it must be made clear to the public that no one is above the law .
anything less will under@@ mine the transition .
moreover , corruption is the ban@@ e of development everywhere , so new governments should move fast to establish institutions and procedures to fight it .
transparency and accountability are powerful ideas with near-@@ universal support , which means that new leaders should not give up when the fight becomes difficult .
ci@@ vil@@ -@@ society organizations , local communities , representatives of the poor and vulnerable , and women play a vital role in this regard , and they should be included at every level of decision-making .
in indonesia , we signed a hundred laws in less than 18 months , covering everything from media freedom to elections , corruption , de@@ centr@@ alization , and anti-@@ trust rules .
we rati@@ fied new publi@@ c-@@ finance legislation and en@@ su@@ red the independence of the country ’ s central bank .
in post-@@ revolutionary times , expectations are high , and the obstacles to meeting them are enormous .
i know from personal experience that we did not always have the luxury of getting the best outcomes .
we had to compromise and settle for the best possible results .
security threats are among the most serious se@@ t@@ backs in transi@@ tions .
nation@@ alistic senti@@ ment is strong , and politicians and interest groups can exploit it .
often , the security forces are hol@@ do@@ vers from the old regime , and there is no independent ju@@ di@@ cial system .
reforms will take time , and the old bureau@@ cra@@ cies may not be able to implement them .
in indonesia , we used various innovations to work around such dilemmas .
for example , we ap@@ pointed an independent judge to take over the bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and corruption courts , because career judges were too tain@@ ted .
likewise , when we started c@@ ash@@ -@@ for-@@ work programs as part of our pro-@@ poor agenda , we asked communities to run these initi@@ atives .
more broadly , new leaders are well advis@@ ed to ensure that the economy performs well .
it is important to restore economic activity and create a favor@@ able environment for entrepreneurs , particularly small and medi@@ um-@@ size businesses , which constit@@ ute the main engine of job creation .
the recent revolutions , it should be rec@@ alled , started with the self-@@ imm@@ ol@@ ation of a tunisi@@ an fruit ven@@ dor , who was har@@ as@@ sed and insul@@ ted by the authorities .
but economic success without accountability and social inclu@@ sion is not sustainable , and new governments often must face tough choices in order to protect the poor and vulnerable .
they might have to abo@@ lish mis@@ -@@ targeted subsidies to free up resources for more targeted and efficient anti-@@ poverty and job@@ -@@ creation programs .
in indonesia , we had to draw a line between the very poor and the near-@@ poor .
our help had to be targeted .
this was a tough and un@@ popular choice .
finally , countries in transition need support – not only money , but also technical know-how to implement highly complex reforms .
when i became indonesia ’ s finance minister , i had 6@@ 4,000 employees .
but when we had to moderni@@ ze our tax system , we could not find the required expertise anywhere in our country .
yes , we needed external assistance , but we never sur@@ rendered “ ownership ” of the reform process ; we made it work for us .
if we indones@@ ians had not been in charge of our own transition , it could easily have failed .
that lesson , too , is one that all countries in transition should bear in mind .
winning with opium in afghanistan
despite consider@@ able effort by the international community in afghanistan since 2001 to eliminate the taliban and al qaeda , the insur@@ gency in the south of the country has gathered momentum at break@@ neck speed in recent months .
our field research shows that we are not winning the campaign for the hearts and minds of the afghan people – the taliban are .
indeed , the international community ’ s methods of fighting the insur@@ gency and eradic@@ ating po@@ ppy crops have actually helped the insur@@ g@@ ents gain power .
the international community has so far pursu@@ ed policies of destruction , rather than the promised reconstruction .
the aggressive united stat@@ es-@@ led counter-@@ nar@@ co@@ tics policy of crop eradication has failed to win the support of afgh@@ ans , because it has triggered a chain reaction of poverty and violence in which poor farmers , with their only live@@ lihood destroyed , are unable to feed their families .
this has been exac@@ erb@@ ated by the failure to provide even the most basic aid and development in the country ’ s poorest areas .
at the same time , communities have been torn apart as a result of bom@@ bing campaigns , which have destroyed the very homes we came to protect .
this , in addition to four years of drought , has forced entire families to leave their villages for ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft internal refugee camps .
you do not win people over by bom@@ bing them , but by helping them .
the taliban have explo@@ ited the failures of the international community in extremely effective anti-@@ western propaganda that has fu@@ eled significant doubt in the minds of the public concern@@ ing the reasons justi@@ fying the international presence in afghanistan .
sadly , our troops are often the first to pay the price – sometimes with their lives .
it is not too late to win back the hearts and minds of the afghan people .
international troops are exc@@ elling in an excep@@ tionally hostile environment , but this is not a war that will be won by military means alone .
with public perception a crucial factor in winning the war , and the taliban pois@@ ed to launch a large military initiative next spring , failure to adopt a successful local strategy could signi@@ fy the last chance the international community will have to build a secure and stable afghanistan .
but a successful strategy – one that responds to afghanistan ’ s extreme poverty crisis – requires that the international community reverse course on crop eradication .
in fact , the eradication of po@@ ppy crops not only damage local communities and under@@ mines the international community ’ s goals , but it is also failing : opium production last year was at an all-@@ time high .
in september , the united nations office on drugs crime announced that po@@ ppy cultiv@@ ation so@@ ared by a recor@@ d-@@ high 60 % .
eradication will never be successful in afghanistan , because it destro@@ ys the single crop that will grow in the south ’ s harsh climate – and thus serves as the main source of income to millions of people .
so a new , long-term , economically sustainable solution is ur@@ gently needed – one that directly eng@@ ages with the communities that are suffering most – in order to achieve the support of the deeply im@@ pover@@ ished rural population .
as a way to address this dilemma , the sen@@ lis council is proposing to run scientific pilot projects to research an opium licen@@ sing system for afghanistan , which would be a core component of the economic reconstruction process .
a system in which po@@ ppy is cultiv@@ ated under license for the production of pain@@ -@@ killing medicines such as morph@@ ine and co@@ deine would allow farmers to pursue their traditional live@@ lihood and way of life , and , more importantly , to feed themselves and their families .
there is a global shortage of morph@@ ine and co@@ deine , particularly in under@@ developed countries , where these vital medicines are often in short supply , if not completely un@@ available .
not only would po@@ ppy licen@@ sing address the poverty and hunger crises that have eng@@ ul@@ fed the south of afghanistan ; it also would stabilize existing local structures , giving communities a reason to support president ham@@ id kar@@ za@@ i ’ s government and the international community .
farmers would gain a sense of ownership in counter-@@ nar@@ co@@ tics efforts , in sharp contrast to the current ide@@ alistic – and evi@@ dently un-@@ achie@@ vable – policy of crop eradication .
we must have the bac@@ king of the afghan people if we are to defeat the taliban .
by end@@ or@@ sing such an initiative , the international community would demonstrate that it is in afghanistan for the good of the local population , which would help farmers se@@ ver ties with the insur@@ gency .
but for such a system to be successful , the extreme poverty in the south of the country must first be our top priority .
according to the world food program , 70 % of the population lack food security .
an immediate injection of emergency food and medical aid is ur@@ gently needed to break the vicious circle of suffering and violence .
only then could a new , long-term development strategy in afghanistan – one that admit@@ s that the international community is not winning the war , and that the status quo is unacceptable – be implemented .
licen@@ sing the opium crop would be a realistic and pragmatic cor@@ ner@@ stone of that strategy ’ s success .
with@@ drawing from the war on drugs
gen@@ eva – switzerland ’ s direct democracy allows citizens who have gathered enough petition sig@@ natur@@ es to challenge government policies and laws in nation@@ wide refer@@ en@@ da .
after a sp@@ ate of aids deaths during the 1980 ’ s , the swiss came face to face with a problem that has destroyed millions of lives in the united states , russia , latin america , the european union , southern asia , and other regions .
intra@@ ven@@ ous drug users – especially heroin addi@@ cts – had turned public spaces in zur@@ ich and other swiss cities and towns into needle parks . aids proved itself to be blind to afflu@@ ence .
the swiss did not respond with the kind of negle@@ ct that russia ’ s government has shown so far toward its heroin and hiv epidemi@@ cs – more than two million drug users and an estimated one million people living with hiv , over 60 % of them infected while sharing contaminated needles . nor did the swiss react with a “ war on drugs ” and massive funding for more policing , more ja@@ ils , and mand@@ atory prison sentences .
that war is well and truly lost .
the us now incarcer@@ ates more people than any other country , largely as a result of so@@ aring drug convi@@ ctions , with a dis@@ proportion@@ ate number of african-american and his@@ panic prisoners . the war on drugs has enabled drug car@@ tel@@ s to re@@ ap higher profits than ever and transform entire communities in latin america into fie@@ f@@ doms .
drug money is corrup@@ ting democratic governments and la@@ w-@@ en@@ for@@ cement institutions around the world .
dru@@ g-@@ related violence has consumed un@@ told numbers of victims in afghanistan , burma , colom@@ bia , the us , and mexico .
the swiss re-@@ examined their government ’ s drug policies with a pragmatic eye .
health professionals took the lead in a campaign to press the government – through the mechanisms of direct democracy – to shift its focus from arre@@ sting and pun@@ ishing drug users toward publi@@ c-@@ health policies that are based on scientific evidence of what works .
the swiss implemented meth@@ ad@@ one program@@ s. and , in order to prevent the spread of hiv , they created needle ex@@ changes , including in prisons , and established safe injection rooms on a large scale .
the swiss federal office of public health also over@@ saw an experiment in prescri@@ bing heroin to people who had lived with opi@@ ate dependen@@ cy for significant periods .
the swiss government ’ s careful evaluation of this approach demonstrated that hero@@ in-@@ assi@@ sted therapy is both feasi@@ ble and cost-@@ effective , and that it can bring patients significant health improvements .
moreover , it contributed to a startling drop in dru@@ g-@@ related crime .
the swiss public was so convinced of the benefits of hero@@ in-@@ assi@@ sted therapy that , in two nation@@ wide votes , voters end@@ or@@ sed the policy , despite domestic political opposition and criticism from the international nar@@ co@@ tics control board .
switzerland is a conservative country .
trafficking in il@@ lic@@ it nar@@ co@@ tics remains illegal .
in november 2008 , the swiss rejected a proposal for du@@ tch@@ -@@ style de@@ crimin@@ alization of can@@ nab@@ is .
and some policymakers question whether the swiss approach has focused drug policy too much on public health and too little on dealing with the poverty and social exclu@@ sion faced by drug users .
switzerland ’ s pragmatic approach to drug abuse has nonetheless yiel@@ ded significant lessons that are applic@@ able to the us , russia , and the many other dru@@ g@@ - and hiv / aids-@@ ra@@ va@@ ged countries over which they wi@@ eld significant influence .
so have similar approaches in portugal , which only a decade ago led the eu in dru@@ g-@@ related hiv / aids cases .
portugal ’ s decision in 2001 to de@@ crimin@@ alize pos@@ session of illegal drugs led not only to more drug users in treatment ( rather than in prison ) , but also a significant decrease in the number of drug users newly infected with hiv .
one lesson is the crucial importance of using scientifically rigorous investigation of new programs – rather than popu@@ list rhetoric , religious mor@@ alizing , and urban myth – to guide policy@@ making .
this requires coordin@@ ating policing and health programs within a coherent policy framework , investing in research and public education on drug policy , opening new programs to independent review , and standing up to ideological criticism , both domestic and international , with evidence and prag@@ mati@@ sm .
to convey these and other significant lessons , and to advocate worldwide for effective har@@ m-@@ reduction policies – and for broader public debate about more efficient and humane drug policies – we and other world leaders have initi@@ ated the global commission on drug policy , which held its in@@ augu@@ ral meeting in gen@@ eva in january .
our aim is to show that the war on drugs is lost .
switzerland , portugal , and other countries have demonstrated that there is a better way forward , combining prag@@ mati@@ sm and cost effectiveness with compassion and respect for human rights .
germany ’ s same old foreign policy
mun@@ ich – more than ten weeks after its general election , germany continues to be without a new government .
but , though the post-@@ election coalition negotiations have been un@@ usually pro@@ lon@@ ged , there is little disagreement between the parties over foreign and security policy .
except for a few t@@ wea@@ ks that generally resonate more at home than with germany ’ s european and international partners ( such as requ@@ ir@@ ing the government to be more transparent concern@@ ing arms exports to auto@@ cratic regimes ) , continuity and caution will remain the wat@@ ch@@ words of german foreign and security policy .
obser@@ vers may disagree about whether german leaders ’ stance provides a welcome sign of reli@@ ability or reflects a lam@@ ent@@ able lack of diplo@@ matic ambition .
those who hope for more active german leadership may well be disappointed by the new government .
big ideas , or even big questions , are not@@ ably ab@@ sent from the coalition agreement .
this is very much a reflection of many ger@@ mans ’ views about themselves and their future : they are comfortable with the status quo , see no need for further reform pro@@ pos@@ als , are not interested in grand strategy , and would largely prefer to be left alone .
succ@@ essive german governments have main@@ tained that the alliance should be , or even is , the place to discuss and decide on key security challenges .
but germany has at times been rather reluctant to take crisis issues to nato headquarters .
and when it comes to pro@@ vision of military and civilian security beyond what the coalition agreement calls “ our geographic neighborhood , ” the in@@ coming government will favor enabling other regional organizations to do the job .
or consider the question of turkey ’ s acc@@ ession to the european union .
continuing disagreement between the coalition partners will not per@@ mit a pro@@ active german role .
instead , the compromise solution will be no solution : neither yes nor no .
at the same time , some interesting new perspectives appear in the coalition agreement .
for star@@ ters , the united states ’ strategic “ pi@@ vo@@ t ” to the asi@@ a-@@ pacific region is described as an opportunity for europe to ass@@ ert a coordinated foreign policy that finally plays a role in the development of cooperative policies in the region .
moreover , to encourage this outcome , the coalition agreement promises that the government will “ adopt new initi@@ atives to streng@@ then and deep@@ en the common foreign and security policy ” after the eu summit in december 2013 .
it includes a call for an annual european council session on security and defense , as well as for a strategic debate about the purpose of eu foreign relations .
in addition , the german government will support european defense integration and maintain the establishment of a european army as a long-term goal .
this may not amount to much in practice , but the language in this section is much less te@@ pid than elsewhere .
finally , the coalition agreement responds to concerns about germany ’ s ability to be a reliable partner in nato and eu military missions in a potentially more integrated eu defense organization .
however , germany ’ s partners will hardly agree to integrate forces further if the german parliament were to retain a ve@@ to over their deplo@@ yment .
the coalition partners disagree about how urgent it is to sort out this issue .
nonetheless , they have agreed that , within a year , a commission will provide different options and models to protect the german parliament ’ s rights while providing as@@ sur@@ ances to germany ’ s european partners that the country will be a reliable contribu@@ tor to tro@@ op deplo@@ y@@ ments .
should the sp@@ d , which will vote on the coalition agreement in early december , block the formation of the new government ( an unlikely development but not entirely out of the question ) , dispu@@ tes over security and defense affairs would not be the cul@@ pr@@ it .
aside from a few minor partic@@ ul@@ ars , consensus pre@@ va@@ ils .
“ i do not like the idea that germany plays itself up to impose its will on others , ” german president jo@@ ach@@ im gau@@ ck said recently . “ yet neither do i like the idea that germany plays itself down to es@@ che@@ w risks or solidar@@ ity . ”
to some degree , the new coalition will feel the pressure and consider the necessi@@ ty to assume more responsibility for international leadership .
but it will respond ever so slowly and ever so carefully .
the bottom line is this : expect no surprises from germany .
considering how difficult it has been for some , if not most , other eu countries to deal with the challenges of the last five years , that is actually rather good news .
wol@@ fo@@ witz and the world bank at bay
will world bank president paul wol@@ fo@@ witz ’ s trou@@ bles finally cataly@@ ze real change at the world bank ?
will there finally be an end to the arch@@ a@@ ic practice by which the president of the united states un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally ap@@ points the head of the world ’ s most important development agency ?
facing an extraordinary re@@ bu@@ ke from the bank ’ s ministeri@@ al over@@ sight committee and open revol@@ t from his professional staff , wol@@ fo@@ witz has faint hope of li@@ mp@@ ing through the last three years of his term .
the immediate u@@ pro@@ ar is over the exce@@ ed@@ ingly generous pay and promotion package that wol@@ fo@@ witz awar@@ ded in 2005 to his girlfriend as compen@@ sation for leaving the bank to pa@@ ve the way for his arri@@ val .
at a time when the bank has been emphasi@@ zing high governance standards as the key to development , the recent revelation of that arrangement ’ s details have dealt a serious blow to the bank ’ s credi@@ bility .
but even if wol@@ fo@@ witz is eventually forced to res@@ ign , nothing will be gained if us president george w. bush is allowed summar@@ ily to choose his replacement , as us presidents have been doing ever since the bank was founded after world war ii .
instead , the bank ’ s head should be chosen in an open and transparent process that aims to select the best-@@ qualified candidate , whether from the us , europe , or the developing world .
indeed , a big part of wol@@ fo@@ witz ’ s weakness today is the way he came to his job , as an in-@@ your@@ -@@ face appointment from a us administration weak at international cooperation .
the world bank is a development finance institution .
but wol@@ fo@@ witz ’ s background at the us state and defense de@@ partments gave him no real expertise or experience in either area .
instead , his claim to fame was his role as architect of america ’ s failed war in iraq .
by all accounts , wol@@ fo@@ witz is brilliant , but it seems in@@ concei@@ vable that an open , transparent , and multi@@ lat@@ eral selection process would have chosen him to head the world bank .
i reach this conclusion even though i am sym@@ pathetic to the bush administration ’ s desire to cataly@@ ze change at the bank .
i have long advoc@@ ated shifting the bank ’ s center of gravity from len@@ ding to ou@@ tri@@ ght gr@@ ants , a policy that the bush administration strongly end@@ or@@ ses .
but choosing someone with no obvious background or experience in economic development was not the way to make progress on this front .
a more open selection process , indeed , would have zo@@ omed in on the fact that wol@@ fo@@ witz ’ s girlfriend worked at the bank .
this may seem a trivial issue , but it is not , given the bank ’ s strong policies to protect against ne@@ po@@ tism .
if wol@@ fo@@ witz were otherwise overwhel@@ m@@ ingly the most qualified candidate , the selection committee may have found a way to fin@@ esse the issue , open@@ ly and transpar@@ ently .
but , given his question@@ able fit for the job in the first place , the girlfriend issue might have been dis@@ quali@@ fying .
why does the world me@@ ek@@ ly go along with the status quo and let the us dic@@ tate the bank ’ s top position ?
it is a sorry tale of poor global governance .
europe does not get in america ’ s way because it wants to maintain europe ’ s equally out-@@ dated privilege of ap@@ pointing the head of the international mon@@ etary fund , the bank ’ s sister institution .
asia has little choice but to de@@ fer to the us and europe ’ s sh@@ en@@ ani@@ gans because it is gross@@ ly under-@@ represented in both organizations .
as for africa , its leaders are lo@@ ath to do or say anything that might interrupt the flow of world bank lar@@ ges@@ se .
many people , including myself , have long complained about the leadership selection process at the world bank and the imf .
how can the bank and the fund continue to go around lec@@ turing developing economies on good governance and transparency but fail to allow change in their own houses ?
now and again , both organizations pay lip service to the issue .
but so far , they have exhi@@ bited no real desire for change .
to be fair , the imf ’ s leadership is making a determined effort to give dynamic emerging economies , particularly in asia , a bigger say in fund governance .
if carried far enough , this process would ultimately cataly@@ ze the necessary changes .
unfortunately , the imf ’ s re@@ balancing efforts are proce@@ eding at a gl@@ ac@@ ial pace .
at the world bank , nothing seems to be happening at all .
perhaps when gordon brown becomes the uk ’ s next prime minister , he will be able to convince the g@@ 7 group of rich countries to lead the charge for change .
as head of the fund ’ s ministeri@@ al over@@ sight committee , brown understands the issues as well as anyone .
or perhaps the wol@@ fo@@ witz de@@ bac@@ le will prove to be the cataly@@ st .
maybe at last , the next world bank or imf president will come from outside their usual do@@ ma@@ ins .
there are plenty of great potential non-@@ american candidates .
south african finance minister tre@@ vor manuel has ably served as head of the world bank ’ s over@@ sight committee and would make a brilliant world bank president .
and it still could be a qualified american .
what about bill clinton ?
one way or the other , the bank and the imf leadership selection process ur@@ gently needs to be re@@ vam@@ ped .
what the wol@@ fo@@ witz de@@ bac@@ le tells us most clearly is that the time for patience with the status quo is over .
women and development
copenhagen – a girl born in south asia or sub-saharan africa faces a cruel double burden .
she will grow up in a region bes@@ et by poverty , disease , war or famine . she will also confront these challenges with the added dis@@ advantage of being female .
although more attention is being given to gender issues , inequality persi@@ sts in every culture , country , and continent .
a new study for the copenhagen consensus project shows that eliminating this dispar@@ ity is an investment with high payo@@ ffs .
despite global interest in education for all , many girls in poor countries continue to be denied basic education ; right from the start , they are dis@@ advanta@@ ged .
three in five illiterate children in the world are girls .
particularly in south asia and sub-saharan africa , cultural norms and economic hard@@ ships stop parents from sending their daughters to school or from keeping them in school for as long as they en@@ roll their sons .
this unequal investment is neither equ@@ itable nor efficient .
an obvious solution is to build more schools in places where girls and boys must be educated separ@@ ately .
in poor muslim countries like pakistan , yemen , and mor@@ oc@@ co , single-@@ sex schooling is the norm , but many rural areas can afford only one public school , which is usually set aside for boys .
in theory , about half of the education gap in these areas could be closed by building girls ’ schools .
elsewhere , supply constraints are not the problem .
instead , policymakers must find ways to streng@@ then the incentives for parents to send their daughters to school .
in countries where the family ’ s cost of schooling girls is lower@@ ed either by a no-@@ fe@@ e policy or by a sti@@ p@@ end for girls who en@@ roll in school , girls ’ en@@ roll@@ ment rate increases .
the experiences of these few countries lead us to propose a system where@@ by mothers are paid if their school-@@ age daughters attend school regularly from the 3@@ rd to the 9@@ th grade .
this would increase girls ’ en@@ roll@@ ment and also put money into women ’ s hands – important because studies show that money given to women is more likely to provide positive nutritional and health benefits for their children than money given to men .
it also provides the women with greater bar@@ gaining power in their own households .
the annual cost per pu@@ pi@@ l would be $ 32 .
covering every eli@@ gible girl in sub-saharan africa and south asia for a year would cost $ 6 billion .
benefits from increased future wages and the reduction in heal@@ th-@@ care use would be between three and 26 times higher .
pregnancy is one of the most vulnerable times for poor women ; 99 % of the 5@@ 29@@ ,000 women who die annu@@ ally from preg@@ nan@@ cy@@ -@@ related compli@@ cations live in developing countries .
severe malnutrition and the absence of pr@@ en@@ at@@ al care during pregnancy put both mother and child at serious risk .
spending $ 3.@@ 9 billion on family planning and maternal health initi@@ atives , such as pro@@ vision of emergency contra@@ ception in sub-saharan africa and south asia , could aver@@ t 1.@@ 4 million infant deaths and 14@@ 2,000 preg@@ nan@@ cy@@ -@@ related deaths in women .
making reproductive services available to women who cannot afford to pay their way can help prevent these deaths .
but such services must not shy away from promoting and providing modern contra@@ cep@@ tive methods to avoid un@@ wanted preg@@ nan@@ cies .
nearly 20 % of women in developing countries report that they would like to stop having more children but are not using any form of contra@@ ception or family planning , possibly because reproductive services are not available .
for adolescent girls , early marriage or an un@@ wanted pregnancy typically cur@@ tails schooling .
del@@ a@@ ying marriage and child@@ bearing allows them to gain more education and perhaps more earning opportunities , as well as improved health , education , and labor market success for their future children – benefits worth ten times more than the cost of providing reproductive services .
other tools , aside from schooling , can help women improve their in@@ com@@ e-@@ earning ability .
micro@@ finance institutions , such as bangladesh ’ s gra@@ meen bank , play a vital role in allowing self-@@ employed women to build profitable businesses .
small loans empower women by giving them more control over household assets and resources , more autonomy and decision-making power , and greater access to participation in public life .
women are more likely than men to meet regular re@@ payments and to spend their ear@@ nings on children ’ s health and education .
policymakers should continue to facili@@ tate the roll@@ out of micro@@ finance programs .
studies show that each dollar lo@@ an@@ ed by a micro@@ finance institution increases household expen@@ di@@ ture by almost 10 % in the first year , and that the benefits will continue for another 30 years . benefits are estimated to end up about six times higher than the costs .
though women have the right to vote in almost every country , gender ine@@ qualities in political representation remain large .
governments should consider gender quot@@ as at the local level of politics .
greater female representation may not necessarily lead to more emphasis on “ female ” policy priorities , but in india , village coun@@ cils with gender quot@@ as for village chie@@ fs have higher levels of safe drinking water , better immuni@@ zation coverage and roads , and less bri@@ bery .
there may be some losses from elec@@ ting women because they tend to have less political experience than men , but the record in india suggests that if it took 20 years to establish a 30 % share of women in local positions in other countries , the benefits would be at least double the costs of achieving this .
being a woman need not and should not be among the greatest challenges of life .
copenhagen – the past decade has proven again and again that empowering women worldwide holds the key to solving many seemingly intra@@ ctable issues that have otherwise sty@@ mi@@ ed policymakers .
poverty in the developing world seemed in@@ eradic@@ able until micro-@@ len@@ ders saw millions of low-income , dest@@ it@@ ute women as potential entrepreneurs .
involving african women in decision-making about crop production turns out to enable environmentally sustainable farming practices .
run@@ away population growth becomes controll@@ able when women have access to literacy and business opportunities as well as to contra@@ ception .
could the ten@@ sions and conflicts surrounding the issue of immigration in europe be yet another issue for which the empowerment of women holds a solution ?
in a recent visit to copenhagen to com@@ memor@@ ate international women ’ s day , i took part in many conversations that du@@ plic@@ ate others throughout europe : citizens from across the political spectrum were struggling with the issue of non-@@ european immigration and the cultural ten@@ sions that have en@@ sued .
what does it mean to be danish , german , or french in the presence of these millions of new@@ com@@ ers , most of whom come from non-@@ democratic societies ?
some of this anxiety is pure racism ; but some is not .
what would “ integration ” mean , and how is it achieved without the loss of cher@@ ished ci@@ vil@@ -@@ society values ?
these are not necessarily xen@@ opho@@ bic questions : a post-@@ enlightenment civil society , with a free press and due process , is a precious thing , and those values should not be sacrifi@@ ced to politically correct moral rela@@ tivism .
this issue has been given new urgency by the arre@@ sts in ireland of alle@@ ged ji@@ ha@@ di@@ sts from several countries who are accused of plot@@ ting to murder a swedish cartoonist who drew an image of the prophet mohammed as a dog .
across europe , the discussions are growing more intense as anti-@@ immigration platforms gain suppor@@ ters in otherwise liberal countries , from germany to france to traditionally inclusive and tolerant denmark itself .
then i witnessed the prototype of a true solution .
i met elisabeth m@@ ø@@ ll@@ er jen@@ sen , the director of k@@ vin@@ fo , “ the danish center for information on gender , equality and ethni@@ city ” – an extraordinary organization funded by denmark ’ s ministry of culture .
one of its many innovative programs is already showing results in terms of genuinely integrating immigrant families into danish society .
by addressing immigrant women – and by viewing them as potential leaders , rather than as qui@@ es@@ cent potential ma@@ ids or service workers – k@@ vin@@ fo is enabling their families to witness the benefits of an open civil society in their own lives .
by 2010 , it had 5,000 participants , had won awards and international acc@@ la@@ im for best integra@@ tive practices , and is being replic@@ ated throughout denmark – and obser@@ vers are exploring programs or partnerships modeled upon it in canada , spain , portugal , and norway .
the program pairs refugee and immigrant women in a one-@@ to-one ment@@ oring relationship with women who are established leaders at all levels of danish society .
the pair@@ ing is not cur@@ sor@@ y .
a careful mat@@ ch@@ making process un@@ ites the interests and goals of the women on both sides , and already has paid amazing divi@@ den@@ ds .
women who were journalists , engineers , or scientists in their countries of origin – and who could not get jobs as check@@ out cas@@ hi@@ ers in denmark – have been paired with danish counter@@ parts and are now back in school , or working in research .
but even women who arrive with no higher education or professional skills create an “ action plan . ”
they learn from their mentors what options there are , how to proceed , and what to do to reach their obje@@ ctives . as they enter the workforce , their language skills improve , their household income so@@ ars , and their children see fir@@ sth@@ and a woman in a respected , economically valued role .
their loved ones thus learn how to thrive in a european context – occasionally coming to k@@ vin@@ fo events and benef@@ iting from their mothers ’ expanding network of contacts .
so , rather than feeling explo@@ ited and con@@ dem@@ ned in@@ definitely to the fr@@ ing@@ es of a northern european society – and thus vulnerable to the stir@@ rings of de@@ ma@@ go@@ gues and extremi@@ sts – these women ’ s children grow up fully familiar with danish civil society , well informed about higher education and professional opportunities , and hopeful rather than cy@@ ni@@ cal .
by empowering women , the whole family is lifted up and , in a supportive rather than a coloni@@ zing way , “ europe@@ ani@@ zed ” in the best sense .
i am often struck by the way many europeans use arm@@ s-@@ length eu@@ p@@ hemis@@ ms when talking about immigr@@ ants : they want immigr@@ ants to feel “ welcome ” or “ comfortable . ”
i always wonder , “ but do you want them to feel french , or german , or norwe@@ gian ? ”
to be fully integrated , muslim and other new@@ com@@ ers to european countries must be wel@@ com@@ ed not as perpe@@ tual visitors – even if , ide@@ ally , as nicely treated visitors – but rather as family members , as the american model does ( or asp@@ ires to do ) .
as m@@ ø@@ ll@@ er jen@@ sen put it , “ i want these children to feel danish . ” these young people and denmark itself will benefit , as this “ k@@ vin@@ fo generation ” grows up with a genuine stake in danish civil society , and seeing the world as dan@@ es , not as guests .
arab women ’ s unfinished revolution
fe@@ z – though women across the middle east particip@@ ated actively in the arab spring prote@@ sts that began in late 2010 , they remain second-@@ class citizens , even where popular u@@ pris@@ ings managed to top@@ ple auto@@ cratic regimes .
indeed , the islam@@ ist governments now in power in several countries seem more determined than the des@@ pots that they replaced to keep women out of politics .
in conducting interviews with women in the region , i am struck by their overall pessi@@ mis@@ m .
they fear the loss of their rights .
they see economic dis@@ integration all around them , raising the possibility of a further increase in violence .
as social bonds fra@@ y , they feel increasingly vulnerable .
more than once , i heard them express the view that things were better before the revolutions .
female representation in parli@@ am@@ ents and government cab@@ ine@@ ts after the arab spring has been either ab@@ sent or me@@ ager , and women activists worry that islam@@ ist parties will implement re@@ ac@@ tionary policies that discrimin@@ ate on the basis of gender .
in egypt , for example , the freedom and justice party , which domin@@ ates the parliament , claims that a woman cannot become president .
egyptian women were heavily represented in the prote@@ sts that brought down former president ho@@ sn@@ i mubarak ’ s regime in 2011 , but they have been largely exclu@@ ded from any official decision-making role ever since .
in mor@@ oc@@ co , while there were ei@@ ght@@ women in the previous cabinet , today there is only one in the islam@@ i@@ st-@@ led government .
in january , the islam@@ i@@ st-@@ dominated parliament adopted a decre@@ e lower@@ ing the age of marriage for girls from 18 to 16 , a major se@@ t@@ back .
mor@@ oc@@ can femini@@ sts have prote@@ sted vi@@ gor@@ ously , but to no a@@ va@@ il .
parli@@ am@@ entary representation for women has also taken a hit .
women hold less than 1 % of seats in the current egyptian parliament ; previously , they held 12 % .
in libya , a first dra@@ ft of the elec@@ toral law reserved 10 % of seats in the constitu@@ ent assembly for women , but the quot@@ a was later abandoned .
in tunisia , the election in 2011 brought 49 women into the 2@@ 17@@ -@@ seat constitu@@ ent assembly .
but 42 of these women are members of en@@ nah@@ da , which regar@@ ds sh@@ aria ( islamic law ) as the source of legislation .
long-@@ time tunisi@@ an activists fear that en@@ nah@@ da , which domin@@ ates the assembly , will use the presence of women mps to restri@@ ct women ’ s rights .
the recent ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of the secular tunisi@@ an opposition leader cho@@ kr@@ i bel@@ aid has raised the stakes for women there .
bel@@ aid was a voice on behalf of women ’ s rights , and the threat of increased political violence will focus on those who advocate secular equality for all tunisi@@ ans , including women .
unfortunately , conservative forces in the arab world repeatedly turn against women when political un@@ rest spreads .
in ba@@ h@@ rain , several women prote@@ sters have been arrested and tortured .
in yemen , the authorities call on male relatives to “ t@@ ame ” their women .
in tunisia , the most we@@ ster@@ ni@@ zed of the arab countries , women have been attacked at universities and schools , and are being forced to wear the hi@@ ja@@ b .
a woman who was alle@@ ge@@ dly raped by two policemen in september 2012 was charged with public in@@ dec@@ ency when she fil@@ ed a compla@@ int .
likewise , in egypt , women prote@@ sters face greater scru@@ tiny than men .
those arrested by the military during the anti-@@ mubarak prote@@ sts were subje@@ cted to virg@@ inity tests as a form of intimi@@ dation .
across the middle east , islam@@ ist mili@@ ti@@ as have har@@ as@@ sed , arrested , raped , and tortured women pro-@@ democracy activists .
the model of iran ’ s islamic revolution in 1979 , which imposed second-@@ class citizenship on women , is frequently c@@ ited as a threat in arab countries now ruled by islam@@ ist parties .
these countries are at a cross@@ roads .
women make up half of the middle east ’ s population , and any hope of political and economic development must account for that fact .
organizations like the united nations development program have repeatedly issued reports demonstrating the connection between economic decline and oppres@@ sion of women .
simply put , the arab countries will not succeed unless women are fully integrated into political and economic life .
in her nobel peace prize acceptance speech in 2011 , yemen@@ i political activist ta@@ wa@@ k@@ ko@@ l kar@@ man , made the point clearly : “ the solution to women ’ s issues can only be achieved in a free and democratic society in which human energy is liber@@ ated , the energy of both women and men together . ”
middle eastern countries should protect and con@@ soli@@ date women ’ s rights as a way to rein@@ force democratic ideas and habits .
they must institute the universal declar@@ ation of human rights and other international laws and agre@@ ements in order to eradicate gen@@ der-@@ based discrimin@@ ation and violence .
the hope for women ’ s progress is really a hope for a decent society in which development for all is possible .
a woman ’ s place is in the digital revolution
mon@@ tre@@ al – digital technologies are a double-@@ ed@@ ged s@@ word for the world ’ s women .
men ’ s greater access to these technologies puts women at risk of being left even further behind economically and socially .
but if women can tap the full power of digital technologies , vital new opportunities will open up for them .
according to estimates by the gs@@ m association , women ’ s access to the internet and mobile phones is about 85 % of the level for men , on average , and a total of 1.@@ 7 billion women in low@@ - and middle-@@ income countries are un@@ connected .
this severely limits the pro@@ spe@@ cts of women and girls .
digital technologies enhance women ’ s access to finance , with mobile banking enabling them to avoid long jour@@ neys to a branch or at@@ m .
likewise , technolog@@ y-@@ enabled health care delivered via phone or tablet improves health outcomes , as it reaches women even in the remot@@ est areas , spar@@ ing them a long and often risky trek to see a doctor .
the times@@ a@@ ving potential of digital technologies is so great that they may make the difference in enabling women to seek paid employment .
today , women under@@ take three-@@ quarters of all un@@ paid care work , producing output of around $ 10 trillion , or 13 % of global gdp – none of which is translated into income , let alone economic power .
by their nature , e-@@ commerce and technolog@@ y-based businesses offer women more flexibility and autonomy , helping them to manage home responsibilities alongside paid work .
in indonesia , wom@@ en-@@ owned businesses generate 35 % of e-@@ commerce revenue , compared with only 15 % of the revenue of offline businesses .
likewise , in china , 55 % of new internet businesses are founded by women , and ali@@ bab@@ a ’ s ta@@ ob@@ ao e-@@ commerce platform has an equal number of male and female store owners .
in fact , china is home to 1@@ 14 of the world ’ s 14@@ 7 self-@@ made female billion@@ aires , compared to just 14 in the second-@@ place country , the united states .
women ’ s economic empowerment is good not just for the women who benefit .
the mck@@ inse@@ y global institute ( m@@ gi ) has estimated that advan@@ cing gender equality could add $ 12 trillion per year to the world economy by 20@@ 25 .
in the asi@@ a-@@ pacific region alone , getting more women into full-time employment in hig@@ her@@ -@@ paid , hig@@ her@@ -@@ productivity sectors could add $ 4.@@ 5 trillion per year to gdp , 12 % above the current trajectory .
at the company level , a growing body of evidence shows that more gender equality is good for bottom lines .
greater diversity of leadership styles improves the quality of decision-making .
if given the opportunity , women could be leading innovators in the age of auto@@ mation and artificial intelligence , and could help to ensure that algorithms are free of gender bias .
for example , in india , where only 29 % of all internet users are female , girls in rural areas often face gen@@ der-@@ based restri@@ ctions on their use of information and communications technologies .
one village in u@@ ttar pradesh implemented a fine for any girl using a mobile phone outside the home .
beyond the social attitudes that under@@ mine women ’ s access to digital technologies , women and girls often dis@@ proportion@@ ately lack the requisi@@ te skills to sei@@ ze the opportunities of the digital age .
in singapore , for example , women lag behind men in education in science , math , engineering , and technology .
at n@@ any@@ ang technological university , females com@@ prised only 27 % of the undergraduate computer-@@ science program in 20@@ 15-@@ 20@@ 16 , despite accounting for half of all under@@ graduates at the university .
what is at stake is not just women ’ s ability to sei@@ ze the opportunities offered by the digital revolution , but also their capacity to with@@ stand the coming wave of auto@@ mation .
according to m@@ gi research , in singapore alone , 80@@ 0,000 full-@@ time-@@ equivalent jobs could be displaced by 2030 due to auto@@ mation .
the jobs that are most vulnerable to auto@@ mation are the low-@@ paid , lower@@ -@@ skill jobs that women are more likely to hold .
at the same time , though auto@@ mation risks disrup@@ ting many jobs ( or tasks within jobs ) for both men and women , it also takes some of the dru@@ d@@ gery out of current work , tail@@ oring it to human abilities .
the result could be higher wages that contribute to the creation of more new jobs – 30@@ 0-@@ 365 million worldwide – as spending increases , with emerging economies gaining the most .
furthermore , among the new jobs that will be created will be many in fields like education and health care , where women have traditionally thri@@ ved .
according to m@@ gi research , more than 100 million jobs could be created over the next 10-@@ 15 years as health care and education needs grow .
it is not yet clear exactly how auto@@ mation will affect women ’ s employment .
but there is no doubt that protecting – and even enhan@@ cing – women ’ s job and income pro@@ spe@@ cts will require up@@ gra@@ ding their skills , so that they can take advantage of the new and changing opportunities created by the ongoing digital revolution .
the success of women in e-@@ commerce at@@ tests to the power of digital technologies to level the economic playing field , to the benefit of individual women , their communities and societies , and the world economy .
more women in work – particularly in the technology industries that are shaping our collective future – would be good news for all .
the media ’ s # me@@ too problem
london – journalism classrooms may be dominated by women , but global media are still ruled by men , who occupy the majority of management positions , report more news stories and are more frequently presented as expert voices .
this imbalance is reflected in the content news@@ rooms produce , with fewer written words and broadcast seconds dedicated to telling women ’ s stories .
it is also reflected in the industry ’ s culture , which leaves women more vulnerable to sexual har@@ ass@@ ment and abuse .
given the importance of relation@@ shi@@ p-@@ building in media , not to mention the desire for connection among journalists who cover extreme or har@@ rowing events in difficult environments , intimate ties can easily form among colleagues and associ@@ ates .
the problem arises when these relationships turn s@@ our or , worse , when they are non-@@ con@@ sensu@@ al or based on co@@ er@@ cion , such as when a more senior colleague pursu@@ es a sexual relationship with a sub@@ ordin@@ ate .
of course , across countries , there can be significant differences in what is considered predat@@ ory or in@@ appropriate behavior .
but , globally , almost half of women journalists report having experienced wor@@ k-@@ related sexual har@@ ass@@ ment , according to a 20@@ 14 study by the international news safety institute ( ins@@ i ) and the international women ’ s media foundation ( i@@ w@@ m@@ f ) .
two-thirds reported that they had faced “ intimi@@ dation , threats , or abuse , ” mostly by bos@@ ses , super@@ vis@@ ors , or co-@@ workers .
for perpetr@@ ators , im@@ pun@@ ity remains the norm .
almost three-@@ fif@@ ths of respon@@ dents in the ins@@ i / i@@ w@@ m@@ f study who had experienced har@@ ass@@ ment said that they had reported inci@@ dents to their emplo@@ yers .
in most cases , however , it was the women who experienced the abuse who suffered ad@@ verse consequences : damaged repu@@ tations and career pro@@ spe@@ cts , not to mention the impact on their psychological and emotional well@@ being .
so while men with hi@@ stories of predat@@ ory behavior continue to occupy senior positions in the global news industry , women journalists are pushed to the point that they consider leaving it .
in a recent survey by the i@@ w@@ m@@ f and tro@@ ll@@ bu@@ sters , one-third of respon@@ dents said that they had considered aband@@ oning journalism ; those at earlier stages in their careers were twice as likely to say that they were considering work in other fields because of the threats and attacks they received , in person or online .
despite the obstacles they face , more women appear to be rising in the ran@@ ks of the global media industry , even though progress is relatively slow .
in digital news@@ rooms , which often have fewer of the inherent ine@@ qui@@ ties of legacy media , the number of women in leadership positions appears to be growing faster .
however , the “ br@@ o ” culture in certain ne@@ wer news@@ rooms carries its own sexual har@@ ass@@ ment risks for women .
meanwhile , in the united states , several high-@@ profile male journalists have lost their jobs in the last year over alle@@ ga@@ tions of in@@ appropriate behavior toward their female colleagues – part of the broader # me@@ too movement .
but , overall , news@@ rooms continue to fail to take seriously the threats female journalists face on the job , both in their own work@@ places and in the field .
while news@@ rooms conduct risk assessment and deplo@@ yment discussions regar@@ ding journalists in the field – where women can be particularly vulnerable to un@@ welcome advances from male colleagues , contacts , or strangers – they rarely account for the specific threats women face , at least not in a suffici@@ ently nuan@@ ced way .
this may be partly because , for major news organizations , these assess@@ ments are often hand@@ led in consul@@ tation with safety advis@@ ers – usually former military men , who may not fully appreciate the particular risks women face .
sometimes , the safety advis@@ ers turn out to be perpetr@@ ators of sexual har@@ ass@@ ment .
anecdot@@ ally , i know of several journalists who have been sexually har@@ as@@ sed by safety advis@@ ers .
depending on where this takes place , such behavior can have significant security implications .
as if that were not enough pressure , female foreign correspon@@ dents who are assau@@ l@@ ted in the field often find themselves at the center of deb@@ ates about whether women should be deployed on certain stories at all .
male correspon@@ dents are never the subjects of such deb@@ ates .
this mach@@ o myo@@ pi@@ a rein@@ forces the dama@@ ging imbalance in perspectives shaping the media .
it also carries significant economic costs .
as the harvard business review put it , “ we all pay the price ” when sexual har@@ ass@@ ment continues or is covered up .
by im@@ pe@@ ding women from advan@@ cing within the industry or compelling them to change jobs , har@@ ass@@ ment dimin@@ ishes their earning potential and depri@@ ves society of the best use of its talents .
the fact is that journalists of various gen@@ ders , ethni@@ cities , and backgrounds experience different environments differently , in terms of both the risks they face and the rewards they can re@@ ap .
any assessment of a story needs to account for that nu@@ ance , with managers choosing the best journalist for the job – and providing the support needed to keep all journalists safe .
to change the organi@@ zational culture that has enabled har@@ ass@@ ment and other forms of abuse against women – a moral obligation , as well as a legal and economic imperative – news@@ room managers must lead from the top .
change will not happen overnight , nor will it be driven by a single actor .
leaders should listen to the women in their ran@@ ks , and invite diverse perspectives to help effect change .
the goal is not to pit young against old or women against men .
it is to rec@@ ti@@ fy the media industry ’ s failure to protect its most vulnerable workers .
we all pay when that failure prevents women journalists from achieving their full potential .
it ’ s time to let women thrive
da@@ vos – in public deb@@ ates around the world , women ’ s empowerment is increasingly being recognized as a top priority .
the question of how to provide more economic opportunities for women is firmly on the agenda at the world economic forum ’ s annual meeting in da@@ vos this year .
and long@@ time advoc@@ ates for women are feeling energi@@ zed , as countless others – men and women alike – have come to recognize the urgency of the task .
affor@@ ding women and girls the opportunity to succeed is not just the right thing to do ; it can also transform societies and economies for the good of all .
for example , bringing women ’ s labor force participation up to the same level as that of men would boost gdp by as much as 9 % in japan and 27 % in india .
the international mon@@ etary fund has documented many other macro@@ economic benefits associated with women ’ s empowerment .
reducing gender gaps in employment and education has been shown to help economies diversi@@ fy their exports .
ap@@ pointing more women to bank@@ ing-@@ super@@ vision boards can prevent co@@ zy grou@@ p@@ think , thereby en@@ suring greater stability and resilience in the financial sector .
closing the gender gap may seem like a tall order , but it is essential for long-term economic development and prosperity .
the challenge for every country , then , is to make the most of all of its people ’ s talents .
realizing women ’ s potential is a universal mission .
but some of the barriers holding women back are also universal . aston@@ ish@@ ingly , almost 90 % of countries have one or more gen@@ der-@@ based legal restri@@ ctions on the books .
in some countries , women still have limited property rights compared to men ; in others , husbands have the right to forbid their wives from working .
beyond legal barriers , women also face social and cultural obstacles that limit their access to education , work , and finance .
this is especially true in countries with fragile political systems .
now that public awareness of is growing , it is time to press ahead with concrete measures to help women remain in the workforce while raising a family .
for a glimpse of what that might look like , consider norway , where affordable child@@ care and par@@ ent@@ al-@@ leave sch@@ emes have proven successful in enabling both mothers and fathers to work .
yes , these programs are costly .
but they are well worth the investment , given employed women ’ s enormous contribution to economic growth .
moreover , programs that help women keep working also change the role of fathers .
in norway and other countries with similar policies , fathers now share equally in par@@ ental leave and chil@@ d-@@ re@@ aring .
as a result , more women can pursue leadership roles in work and public life .
of course , countries that are not yet at norway ’ s level of economic development typically face other gen@@ der-@@ related challenges , including limited access to water and education .
unfortunately , while many countries have made progress in reducing gender gaps in primar@@ y-@@ school en@@ roll@@ ment , there is still much more work to be done at the secondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary levels .
as long as these gaps persist , women will not be able to aspi@@ re to political and economic power on an equal foot@@ ing with men .
accor@@ d@@ ingly , norway has made girls ’ education a top priority in its internation@@ al-@@ development programs .
beyond education , en@@ suring that women in developing countries have access to finance is critical , because it enables them to participate fully in the economy , including as entrepreneurs .
when women are empowered to start their own businesses , they can drive innovation and help their countries prosp@@ er .
because women ’ s labor@@ -@@ force participation is so important for growth , organizations such as the imf are committed to working with governments around the world to empower women economically .
im@@ f-@@ supported programs in egypt and jordan , for example , include measures to boost investment in public nur@@ series and safe public transportation .
in addition to specific policies , today ’ s conversation has increasingly focused on the need for wider social change .
and now that movements such as # equ@@ al@@ pay and # me@@ too have gained so much momentum , it looks like that change could be coming .
it has been inspiring to see so many women , girls , and – yes – men speaking out against retro@@ grade attitudes toward women , which have been holding all of us back .
with the global economy reco@@ vering , governments must now lay the foundation for long-term growth , by creating the conditions for women everywhere to realize their full potential .
discrimin@@ ation and abuse against women can no longer stand .
it is time for women to thrive .
women on top ?
what will g-@@ 8 summit meetings be like when american president hillary clinton and french president s@@ é@@ gol@@ è@@ ne royal join german chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a mer@@ kel in a for@@ mid@@ able triangle of women ’ s power ?
the scenario is not altogether unlikely .
indeed , in the united states and france , there are even alternative female candidates for the pres@@ iden@@ cy ( con@@ do@@ le@@ e@@ zz@@ a rice in america , mich@@ elle alli@@ ot@@ -@@ marie in france ) .
will this mean a new style of both domestic politics and international relations ?
the answer is not obvious .
after all , some women have long had the strength and the will to make it to the top .
think of indi@@ ra gandhi , gol@@ da mei@@ r , or margaret th@@ at@@ cher .
all three were powerful prime ministers of their countries , though perhaps not the epit@@ ome of what might be regarded as feminine values .
they all out@@ did men at their own game and had little time for what came to be called femin@@ ism .
indeed , another trend may be more significant as far as political leadership is concerned .
when it comes to the formation of governments , women have managed to break out of the prison of their traditional do@@ ma@@ ins , such as education and social affairs .
foreign policy in particular has become a female aspiration .
both the us and the european union have women leading their foreign offices ; so do half a dozen eu countries , including britain .
has this changed the style , indeed , the substance of foreign policy ?
und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly , a shift in policy styles is occurring in many parts of the world .
in a word , it appears that the rea@@ gan@@ -@@ th@@ at@@ cher period is over .
while oppon@@ ents of globalization still fight “ neo-@@ liberal ” policies , political dis@@ course has taken a new turn .
words like “ justice ” are back in fashion ; there is concern about globalization ’ s los@@ ers and the “ under@@ class . ”
somehow , people prefer “ so@@ fter ” values than were prevalent in the last two decades .
yet it is not the leading women who above all represent these values .
mer@@ kel may have been so@@ f@@ ten@@ ed by having to presi@@ de over a grand coalition , but her original stance was more of the rea@@ gan@@ -@@ th@@ at@@ cher variety .
yu@@ li@@ ya ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ en@@ ko was clearly the most st@@ ou@@ the@@ ar@@ ted among the leaders of ukra@@ ine ’ s orange revolution , and no one has ever described hillary clinton as particularly “ soft . ”
on the contrary , her possible republican oppon@@ ent in 2009 , senator john mccain , while a war hero , is also a man who represents to many americans the new soft values .
mer@@ kel had a difficult time in the run@@ -up to her recent party conference , because j@@ ür@@ gen rü@@ tt@@ gers , the minister@@ -@@ president of the largest german state , nor@@ th-@@ r@@ hine west@@ p@@ hal@@ ia , reminded the christian democrats of their historical support for strong soci@@ al-@@ welfare policies .
only royal may be said to represent so@@ fter lines against the hard-@@ lin@@ er of the gover@@ ning party , ni@@ col@@ as sar@@ ko@@ zy .
so , have women at or near the top made no real difference to politics ?
whatever change they have brought has not been obvious .
in a sense , women ’ s advance is simply the normal consequence of the gradu@@ al move to effective equality of opportunity that began in the 1960 ’ s .
it took decades to become real , and there are still countries that have a long way to go .
despite ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ en@@ ko ’ s leading role in ukra@@ ine , it would be surprising to see russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin replaced by a woman , and , while there is a female vi@@ ce-@@ president in china , there is no sign of a woman becoming japanese prime minister soon .
even so , in many parts of the world , women have made consider@@ able head@@ way on the path to the top .
not in@@ frequently this has been helped by explicit policies .
david cameron pri@@ des himself on a successful campaign to make 40 % of all conservative parli@@ am@@ entary candidates in britain are women .
but this is precisely the point .
it is not the women at the top who have changed the scene .
rather , it is a more general trend , helped along by open-@@ minded leaders of both sex@@ es , that has changed the political climate in countries .
no one , man or woman , can today aspi@@ re to setting the tone of public dis@@ course without recognizing that politics is no longer only a man ’ s game .
in other words , norm@@ alization by equal opportunity is itself the change .
whatever the particular values of leading candidates , this is und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly progress .
through the loo@@ k@@ ism glass
new york – do women suffer from a double standard in the workplace in relation to how they look ?
have we gotten past the subtle ( and sometimes not-@@ so-@@ subtle ) shade of sex@@ ism in hir@@ ing and promotion – dis@@ proportion@@ ately affecting women – that i identified in 1991 as “ the professional beauty qu@@ o@@ ti@@ ent ” ?
it is hard to believe that we are still talking about this 20 years later – but we must .
when anti-@@ femini@@ sts make the case that there is now a “ level playing field ” for women , and that any gender gap in achievement and pay reflects women ’ s own choices , they should consider what used to be called “ loo@@ k@@ ism . ”
in a recent commentary , the soci@@ ologist michael kim@@ mel described an iowa case in which a 3@@ 3@@ -year-old dental technician , me@@ li@@ ss@@ a nelson , was fired by her male boss , not for issues related to her job performance , but because he found her too sexually attractive to work beside without fear of je@@ opar@@ di@@ zing his mar@@ ital vo@@ ws .
when nelson sued , the court issued a hein@@ ous rul@@ ing – uph@@ eld by the iowa supreme court – affir@@ ming his right to dis@@ miss her for this reason .
one could argue that men , too , are promot@@ ed or pen@@ alized on the basis of their appearance ; indeed , economists have found that those with an “ abo@@ ve-@@ average ” appearance earn 5 % more than their “ less attractive ” counter@@ parts , and that workers with a “ belo@@ w-@@ average ” appearance earn 7-@@ 9 % less than their “ average ” counter@@ parts .
to be fair , there is now a professional premi@@ um on male looks as well .
we all know that there is a reason that politicians spend $ 400 on hair@@ cuts and ceos bo@@ ast about working out at dawn with personal train@@ ers .
looking healthy , fit , you@@ thful , and professional are now signs that male elites use to signal their status to one another in an advanced consumer and corporate economy .
but , as the nelson case shows , women are not just subje@@ cted to the straightforward – equally on@@ er@@ ous – loo@@ k@@ ism that men , too , might face on the job .
young women , especially , suffer from discrimin@@ ation in the workplace when they are seen as “ too ” aes@@ the@@ tically appealing .
many work@@ places channel conven@@ tionally attractive young women into out-@@ front support , or sub@@ ordin@@ ate , jobs , in which their appearance – as they bring coffee to high-@@ status men in meetings – can add value to the corporate “ brand , ” though no value is being added to their own careers .
young women are put into these visible , che@@ er@@ leader roles even when their professional development might be better su@@ ited to their being unseen in a lab , or slo@@ gging away over copy late at night , or addressing a room from a position of authority .
potentially worse is the beating their confidence takes as they spend their twen@@ ties worrying , as their male peers – however attractive – almost never do , that their ( generally minimal ) advan@@ cement reflects an evaluation of their looks , and is not tied to their accompli@@ sh@@ ments .
even more insi@@ dious is the reflex even today in major western media where@@ by attention is regularly directed to the appearance and sexuality of powerful women , especially those in politics .
the hu@@ ff@@ ington post , an otherwise rational publication , ran a report about german chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a mer@@ kel under the headline “ mer@@ kel ’ s c@@ lea@@ vage takes center stage in german elections , ” while anti-@@ mer@@ kel bloggers have called attention to mer@@ kel ’ s “ attra@@ c@@ tiveness gap . ”
germany ’ s die partei , established by the editors of the sati@@ ri@@ cal magazine titanic , made light of the offensive tro@@ pe , running a campaign under the slogan : “ a woman – yes !
but attractive . ”
the late christopher hit@@ chens , by contrast , was not jo@@ king when he par@@ sed margaret th@@ at@@ cher ’ s sex appeal .
this contin@@ ual , rather fe@@ ti@@ shi@@ stic sexu@@ alizing of powerful women con@@ firms the argument i made more than two decades ago in my book the beauty myth : women ’ s appearance is used against them most rigor@@ ously – as a diver@@ sion@@ ary tac@@ tic – when real social , economic , or political power is at stake and almost within their grasp .
it is doub@@ tless demor@@ alizing and distra@@ cting to an influential woman to be continually treated like a b@@ im@@ bo , or else told by major news out@@ lets how un@@ attractive , old , fat , or badly dressed she is .
this ga@@ un@@ t@@ let of scru@@ tiny is why young women with great leadership qualities are often reluctant to enter the public eye : they see this abuse , whether “ positive ” or negative , as a no-@@ win proposition , one that powerful men simply do not face .
does the business press ever call j@@ p@@ morgan ceo jamie di@@ mon cute , or describe him as “ pou@@ ty , ” or re@@ mark on his good hair and nice abs , as though he were a male stri@@ pper ?
do they ever ask ben ber@@ nan@@ ke , “ what ’ s with the facial hair ?
it ’ s not 1979 . ”
do political reporters ever take new@@ t g@@ in@@ gr@@ ich to task for , say , being overweight , un@@ fit , and a poor d@@ res@@ ser ?
no media out@@ let would ever print such observations , which , when aimed at men , would appear insul@@ ting , in@@ appropriately personal , and irrelevant .
so why is it still acceptable to run public commentary about the state of mer@@ kel ’ s c@@ lea@@ vage , or hillary clinton ’ s an@@ kles ?
we should try to imagine a world in which the jamie di@@ mons and new@@ t ging@@ ri@@ ches struggle daily to stay focused on their high-@@ pressure jobs , while tor@@ r@@ ents of comment and attention are devoted to how “ hot ” and well-@@ dressed they are , or alterna@@ tively , how out of shape , middle-aged , and sexually un@@ appealing they are .
many countries have government agencies whose job is to ensure that women – and men – do not face workplace discrimin@@ ation on the basis of their appearance .
unfortunately , that task has not been completed .
but , because the media play a major role in perpetu@@ ating this double standard against women in the public eye , legis@@ l@@ ating or li@@ tig@@ ating against this kind of workplace har@@ ass@@ ment will not help .
sex@@ ist comm@@ ent@@ ators have to scru@@ tin@@ ize themselves ; if they do so honestly , they will not like what they see in the mirror .
washington , dc – on march 8 , the world will celebrate international women ’ s day , an annual opportunity to re@@ commit to gender equality .
this year ’ s obser@@ v@@ ance comes at an important time for women ’ s rights , as global movements like # me@@ too and # times@@ up are re@@ focusing attention on the discrimin@@ atory practices that women confront in their social and professional lives .
but while women in the developed world are wa@@ ging big bat@@ tles over gender bias , women and girls in developing countries remain focused on smaller vic@@ tories .
on this international women ’ s day , we must not forget that in the world ’ s poorest communities , poverty , hunger , domestic violence , and discrimin@@ ation remain ende@@ mic obstacles to gender par@@ ity .
i have studied gender and development in the global south for 15 years .
my research , which has included thousands of interviews with women from india to burkina faso , has centered on one question : how can the international community improve the welfare of the world ’ s poorest women ?
the answer , it turns out , is to help them do what they are already doing on their own .
one of the most effective ways to empower women anywhere , but especially in the developing world , is by promoting financial independence .
in many areas , that means supporting “ informal savings groups , ” networks of like@@ -@@ minded women who pay du@@ es to build a shared pool of resources .
this money can then be drawn on to fund any number of items , such as small business expen@@ ses , school fees , or heal@@ th-@@ care costs .
commun@@ ity-@@ based savings groups – there are millions in asia and africa alone – are changing lives every day .
i once met a woman in burkina faso whose son ow@@ es his life to the financial resources of a savings network .
one evening , when the boy was viol@@ ently ill with diarrhea , his mother called a taxi to take him to the nearest clinic .
but tax@@ is , like ambulan@@ ces , must be paid for in advance , and the woman had no money .
fortunately , a neighbor who belon@@ ged to a health savings group was able to contribute and pay the fare .
that immediate access to cash very likely saved the boy ’ s life .
most savings group loans are similarly small .
in ben@@ in , for example , the average loan size in one group is just $ 9 .
but , in a country where the average annual income is less than $ 800 , small amounts can make a huge difference .
unfortunately , many savings groups , as important as they are , do not scale ; most operate in isolation from official services , which weak@@ ens their effectiveness .
women in poor communities must rely on one another , but they also need access to government and international agencies if they are ever to escape from hunger and poverty .
that is why my organization , the gra@@ meen foundation , is using digital technology and mobile phones to connect savings groups with other service providers .
one of our largest projects is in burkina faso , a desperately poor country in west africa where an estimated 55 % of the population is food insecure for at least a portion of the year .
since 1993 , we have worked with more than 7@@ 3,000 women in nearly 3,@@ 300 savings groups , bringing services directly to the women who need them .
our average participant is 40 years old , illiterate , and ear@@ ns just $ 7 a week selling crops like ses@@ ame and pean@@ ut .
when we began the program , only about half of the women we worked with said they felt empowered in their homes ; many fe@@ ared their husbands .
today , those senti@@ ments are slowly changing .
by serving as a bridge between informal savings groups and banks , health centers , schools , and agricultural extension services , we are helping women make better decisions about food use , nutritional practices , and spending .
our goal is to reduce poverty rates by streng@@ th@@ ening asse@@ t-@@ management skills , which would give women a greater voice in their communities .
during each of my field vis@@ its , i have been amazed at how these efforts are affecting women ’ s lives .
on one recent trip , i met ras@@ mata , a young mother who told me that thanks to the safety net of her savings group , she was managing to support her family despite her husband ’ s emi@@ gration abroad , her father ’ s recent death , and a ling@@ ering drought .
she was diversi@@ fying her income , managing her finan@@ ces , and even adopting cli@@ ma@@ te-@@ smart farming techniques .
the best part was that she described herself as a “ hard-@@ working , respectful , rigorous , and ambitious woman . ”
those are ad@@ jec@@ tives that women everywhere , regardless of their financial situation or education , deserve to as@@ cri@@ be to themselves .
so this week , as the world celebr@@ ates the incredible progress that women have made on the long march to par@@ ity , i will be thinking about women like ras@@ mata , who have accomplished so much despite having so little .
istanbul – over the next few months , the 12,000 employees based at apple ’ s headquarters in cu@@ per@@ tin@@ o , california will complete their move to an extra@@ va@@ gan@@ t new campus .
the “ spaceship , ” covering 2.@@ 8 million square feet , includes a two-@@ story yoga studio , running paths , and even revolutionary pizza boxes that keep slices cris@@ p .
one thing it does not have , however , is day@@ care .
when it comes to ignor@@ ing the importance of child@@ care for working parents , apple is far from unique .
and that om@@ is@@ sion places a powerful drag on parents ’ ability to achieve their economic potential , with women suffering the most .
worldwide , women carry out twice as much un@@ paid domestic and care work – including raising children , caring for sick or elderly family members , and managing the household – as men do .
in mexico , india , and turkey , women do three times more care work than men .
this “ gender ch@@ ore gap ” limits women ’ s choices , as it im@@ pe@@ des their ability to ob@@ tain formal education , secure good jobs , and achieve equal pay .
indeed , though women around the world actually work more than men in total ( including both paid and un@@ paid work ) , they earn one quarter less , on average , hold only one quarter of executive positions in the private sector , and occupy less than one quarter of all seats in national parli@@ am@@ ents .
only half of work@@ ing-@@ age women worldwide are in the paid labor force , compared to more than three quarters of men .
this situation is slowly beginning to change .
un@@ paid household and care work is gradually she@@ dding its reputation as “ women ’ s work , ” and men today are assuming more household responsibilities than their fathers and grand@@ fathers did .
some countries , particularly in europe , are re@@ vis@@ ing traditional leave policies so that parents can choose how to allo@@ cate time off after the birth of a child .
more broadly , the value of un@@ paid household and care work – not just for children and family members , but also for the long-term health of societies and economies – is increasingly being recognized .
efforts to measure the contribution of care work to national economies have produced estimates ranging from 20 % to 60 % of gdp .
in 2015 , united nations member states adopted the sustainable development goals ( s@@ d@@ gs ) , which call for recognizing , reducing , and re@@ distribu@@ ting un@@ paid care work – a measure long proposed by feminist economists and gen@@ der-@@ equality advoc@@ ates .
the question now is what can actually be done to meet this objective .
the responsibility will lie , first and foremost , with governments .
after all , while businesses or neighborhood associ@@ ations may offer child@@ care options to working parents , costs and quality vary widely .
government action is needed to ensure that care services cover all who need them – from pres@@ cho@@ ol children to the sick , the disabled , and the elderly – and that they are univers@@ ally accessible and affordable .
beyond services , however , achieving the s@@ d@@ gs ’ targets will require policy change .
most important , governments must establish requirements for par@@ ental and family leave programs .
together with private companies , they can also provide mon@@ etary incentives for men and women to share household and care work more equally .
such policies have proved effective not only in northern europe – the most commonly c@@ ited model – but also in eastern european countries like li@@ thu@@ ania , est@@ onia , and even hung@@ ary , demonstrating that they can be applied anywhere .
at a time when many governments , particularly in the developing world , are faced with severe fiscal constraints , such interventions may seem far@@ fe@@ tched .
but spending on the care sector should be viewed as an investment , not a cost .
a recent study in turkey showed that one dollar of public money invested in the care sector could create 2.5 times as many jobs as a dollar invested in the construction industry .
more than half of those jobs – decent jobs that could raise incomes and living standards , particularly for poor households – would go to women .
international institutions can play an important role in helping governments to sei@@ ze the opportunities presented by investment in the care sector .
in the former yu@@ gosla@@ v republic of ma@@ ce@@ don@@ ia , the united nations development programme under@@ took an initiative that helped women who had mostly worked at home their entire lives to find jobs in the care sector , enabling them to make use of their skills , by caring for children and for young adults with disabilities , while earning an income .
as populations grow and age , the care sector will only increase in importance .
adap@@ ting to these new circumstances now will give countries a consider@@ able advantage , as it bol@@ sters women ’ s rights and freedoms , generates jobs , and make societies more equal .
so what are we waiting for ?
worker prote@@ sts in china : pl@@ enti@@ ful but pre@@ emp@@ ted
the last annu@@ alized figure for labor prote@@ sts that beijing was willing to announce publicly was 100,000 for the year 1999 .
but a 2001 internal report from the ministry of public security dis@@ closed that the numbers &quot; began a rise like a violent wind &quot; from 1997 , the year of the communist party &apos;s fif@@ te@@ enth congress , which pres@@ sed for factory fir@@ ings in the name of &quot; efficiency . &quot;
while the government is determined to keep news of all dist@@ urban@@ ces out of the media-@@ -@@ or at least down@@ play their size and disrup@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess@@ -@@ -@@ it has been possible to collect information on nearly 200 separate events occurring between 1994 and 2004 , some from news sources in hong kong , some from the western media , and a few from chinese publi@@ cations .
what is spar@@ king so much un@@ rest in a country usually depic@@ ted as daily growing more afflu@@ ent ? generally the causes are these : un@@ paid wages and pen@@ sions ; sudden and massive job termin@@ ations ; and management corruption held responsible for the bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy of industrial enter@@ pris@@ es-@@ -@@ where dis@@ charged workers were secure , enjoying privile@@ ges and benefits , since the 1950s .
job losses in the range of 60 million have suddenly rendered nearly an eighth of the urban popul@@ ace indi@@ gent . often without a depen@@ dable channel for air@@ ing their gri@@ ev@@ ances , hor@@ des of lai@@ d-@@ off workers and retired folk have filled the aven@@ ues over the past decade or so .
doesn &apos;t the government mind if so much of its urban popul@@ ace is sin@@ king into poverty and becoming dis@@ affected ? why is this stabili@@ ty-@@ obsessed regime allowing so much inst@@ ability ?
but there is also a compen@@ sat@@ ory effort that has absorbed much of the energy of the bureau@@ cra@@ cies for labor and social security , and for civil affairs .
for 2004 , the central government allo@@ cated some 78 billion yu@@ an for lai@@ d-@@ off workers and the poor , with loc@@ alities also upp@@ ing their out@@ lays . but the sad truth is that probably only about a quarter of those pushed out of their plants ever received assistance .
for those who have , however , this policy has ni@@ pped dis@@ content in the bu@@ d .
addi@@ tionally , there have been attempts to create new posts , develop labor@@ -@@ intensive industries and small and medium sized firms , promote the private sector , and encourage service jobs , plus offering occupa@@ tional training : the government allo@@ cated an additional 4.@@ 7 billion yu@@ an expres@@ s@@ ly for job creation in 2004 .
other initi@@ atives are a program of allo@@ wan@@ ces , training and placement for the lai@@ d-@@ off ; unemployment insurance ( which , unfortunately , depends on the economic health of the firm to which a worker was once attached ) ; and pension re@@ form@@ -@@ -@@ having similar problems .
recipi@@ ents num@@ ber@@ ed over 20 million as of early 2004 , when 15 billion yu@@ an was bud@@ ge@@ ted for the program ( with the central government contributing a full 60 % ) . these programs are noticed at the grassroots , with the indi@@ gent feeling grateful for them .
protest in china has spu@@ n upward dramatically in recent years , in numbers , scale , and organization . but by the means listed above the regime has become ade@@ pt at supp@@ ressing opposition .
but overall , increasing responsi@@ ven@@ ess@@ -@@ -@@ if clearly not in a democratic mo@@ de-@@ -@@ has managed to maintain the inst@@ ability that does exist at a level and within a scope that marks a game of un@@ written rules -- one of compla@@ in@@ ants con@@ fin@@ ing their chol@@ er within understood bo@@ unds and of the government wat@@ ch@@ ful over an ever-@@ sim@@ mer@@ ing ste@@ w .
cambridge -- will the political resur@@ gence of labor uni@@ ons throw a wr@@ en@@ ch into the wheels of globalization ?
or will their growing strength serve to make globalization more sustainable by fo@@ stering great equality and fairness ?
one way or the other , uni@@ ons stand as a major wild card for the evolution of our economic system in 2008 and beyond .
uni@@ ons ’ rising influence is evident in many recent events : german chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a mer@@ kel ’ s controversial deal to raise minimum wages for post@@ al employees ; several american presidential candidates ’ open mis@@ gi@@ v@@ ings about trade and immigration ; and the chinese leadership ’ s nas@@ cent concerns about labor standards .
along with their political cl@@ out , uni@@ ons ’ intellectual respect@@ ability is also experiencing a renaissance .
after decades of vili@@ fication by economists for raising unemployment and stran@@ gling growth , the union movement is now receiving bac@@ king from thought leaders such as paul kru@@ gman , who argues that stronger uni@@ ons are needed to counter globalization ’ s worst ex@@ cess@@ es .
the sudden emergence of uni@@ ons as a political force is particularly surprising in the united states , where privat@@ e-@@ sector union mem@@ ber@@ ship has fallen from 25 % in 1975 to 8 % today .
from high-tech google to mass re@@ tail@@ er wal-mart , us companies have found ways to keep their shops uni@@ on-@@ free .
only the public sector , where the mem@@ ber@@ ship rate is 35 % , has remained a union ba@@ stion .
one of my best friends from childhood married a union organi@@ zer who found it so difficult to land a job in the us that he eventually moved his family to stri@@ ke-@@ happy canada .
today , us political leaders such as con@@ gress@@ man bar@@ ney frank want to bring back uni@@ ons .
but there is good reason to be skeptical .
for a relatively poor country like china , real uni@@ ons could help balance emplo@@ yers ’ power , bringing qual@@ ity-@@ of-@@ life benefits that out@@ weigh the growth costs .
factory conditions in parts of china are all too remin@@ is@@ cent of the early twen@@ ti@@ eth@@ -@@ century , pre-@@ union us .
thousands of chinese workers die each year in coal mines that sometimes lack basic safety pre@@ cau@@ tions .
but , for the us and rich countries in europe , the argument that stronger uni@@ ons would bring more benefits than costs is far more du@@ bi@@ ous .
nowadays , most workers already have legal and stat@@ u@@ tory rights that cover the basic prote@@ ctions that uni@@ ons originally fought for a century ago .
instead , union influence today all too often serves to pro@@ mul@@ gate in@@ flexible work practices and flat salary structures that do not adequ@@ ately reward work effort and skill .
it is no surprise that the public sector , where productivity is low and fiscal constraints soft , typically has the greatest union concentration .
teachers ’ uni@@ ons , especially , are a catastrophe , blocking any ration@@ alization or improvement of many countries ’ education systems .
before the modern globalization era , uni@@ ons could thrive by organizing on a national scale , giving them enormous bar@@ gaining power vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis both emplo@@ yers and consumers .
now , after the explo@@ sive post-@@ war expansion of global trade , most uni@@ ons have seen their monopoly power ero@@ ded , if not shat@@ tered .
that is why uni@@ ons throughout much of the developed world have been fighting so hard to block free-@@ trade negotiations that might ero@@ de their position further .
some of the issues that uni@@ ons are promoting , such as human rights and environmental quality , are un@@ as@@ sail@@ able .
when they try to connect these issues with trade , however , their mo@@ tives become question@@ able .
a case in point is union lo@@ bb@@ ying against the us-@@ colom@@ bia free-@@ trade agreement , rati@@ fication of which would greatly advance us-@@ latin american relations .
legitimate questions about how the colom@@ bian government conducted its epic civil war with dru@@ g-@@ finan@@ ced rebel@@ s do not trum@@ p broader issues .
so anti-@@ p@@ act activists have complained that colom@@ bia is anti-@@ union because it does not protect union members from rebel violence .
yet the colom@@ bian government notes that all colom@@ bi@@ ans suffer from rebel violence – union members actually experience less of it than the rest of the population .
unfortunately , this play is being re-@@ en@@ acted across a host of trade issues , including many involving china .
for rich countries , income re@@ distribution is much better hand@@ led through taxes and benefits system , rather than by government edi@@ cts to streng@@ then uni@@ ons .
the rich today pay so little in taxes in many countries , that it would be a big improvement simply to move to a flat tax , with a very high ex@@ emp@@ tion level so that lower@@ -@@ income families pay nothing .
for middle-@@ income countries , it is a tougher call .
but here , too , increasing workers ’ legal and stat@@ u@@ tory rights , while allowing most uni@@ ons to fade away , seems like the right approach .
unfortunately , we are far more likely to see uni@@ ons ’ growing political influence become a major dest@@ abili@@ zing force in trade and growth , with highly un@@ certain consequences .
when we see political leaders in many rich countries pan@@ der to uni@@ ons by bas@@ hing each other on free trade and immigration , there is every reason to worry about trouble ahead .
that is why uni@@ ons will be one of the main economic wild cards in 2008 .
the unfinished business of gender par@@ ity
da@@ vos – when it comes to the importance of gender equality in the workplace , the message has clearly gotten through to those at the top .
surveys – including those conducted by my own organization – consistently show that business leaders understand the need for equal treatment of men and women in the workforce .
indeed , my own conversations with senior busines@@ spe@@ op@@ le around the world confirm that progress clearly is being made .
the vast majority recognize the issue as imperative to their companies ’ success and have implemented measures to promote gender par@@ ity in their organizations .
and yet , for all the fine words , much more remains to be done before gender par@@ ity is actually achieved .
the facts speak for themselves .
there is still a pay gap in every country in the world , with men earning more than women for similar jobs .
likewise , the percentage of seats on corporate boards occupied by women appears to have st@@ alled at just over 17 % .
this bias has not gone un@@ noticed – especially among female employees .
in a 2015 p@@ w@@ c global survey of female millenni@@ als born between 1980 and 1995 , half of those working in financial services said they believed that men received more favor@@ able treatment when it came to pro@@ motions .
more than 70 % said that as much as their organizations talk about diversity , in reality , opportunities remain unequal .
interestingly , other studies conclude that when women are provided with the opportunity to perform on an equal foot@@ ing with men , they more often than not come out on top .
a recent ten-@@ year analysis of 300 start-@@ up investments backed by venture capit@@ alists in the united states showed that companies with a female founder performed 63 % better than those with all-@@ male founding teams .
and another of p@@ w@@ c ’ s research programs , exam@@ ining the changing faces of billion@@ aires worldwide , discovered what we called the “ ath@@ ena factor . ”
the increase in the number of female billion@@ aires significantly out@@ pac@@ es that among men , with asia regi@@ stering the fastest growth in the ran@@ ks of self-@@ made female billion@@ aires .
where women have the opportunity to capit@@ alize on their talents , they are doing so successfully and with gu@@ st@@ o .
meanwhile , there is growing recognition of the positive contribution that greater workforce diversity makes to business performance .
and yet , as reflected in the stu@@ b@@ born persi@@ stence of the pay gap , barriers to women ’ s progress remain .
what is now needed is a genuine and permanent shift in attitudes and behavior .
many of the biases holding women back are unconscious ; and , by their very nature , these blind spots cannot be tac@@ kl@@ ed by statements of intent alone .
tackling gender inequality will require us to identify where , how , and why these biases materi@@ alize , and to develop systematic strategies and interventions to root them out .
in order to accomplish this , businesses must actively challenge men to help advance women in the workforce .
that is why i am proud to be a founding corporate impact champion of the un women ’ s he@@ for@@ she movement .
creating real and lasting change will require helping men and women work together .
not only do women make up half the global population ; the same skills needed to work through differences in gender – open-@@ minde@@ dness , humility , empathy – can be used to work across other types of differences , be they cultural , physical , or personal .
it is important , of course , to reas@@ sure male skep@@ tics who view gender par@@ ity as a threat .
in june 2015 , i ho@@ sted a he@@ for@@ she chat on twitter , and while the conversation was overwhel@@ m@@ ingly positive , an obvious concern sur@@ faced : why should men help promote women to positions for which they themselves are a@@ iming ?
addressing such concerns will require us to show that we are not promoting some people at the expense of others ; gender par@@ ity must be win-win , not zero-sum .
at p@@ w@@ c , this is being addressed by ho@@ sting conversations in which men and women discuss gender issues collabor@@ a@@ tively and respect@@ fully , and by working with both gen@@ ders to challenge double standards and acknowledge potential blind spots .
recent research suggests that , at the current rate of progress , it will take another 80 years to reach gender par@@ ity .
that is not good enough .
let us all commit to achieving it in our life@@ times – for the benefit of everyone .
pittsburgh – in the fight against hiv / aids , some stories illumin@@ ate the long road to global eradication more than others .
in 2009 , i heard one such story in tanzania .
i was visiting a remote village when i spoke to a woman who knew that she was hiv-positive .
she told me that the established health guidelines at the time indicated that she could not receive treatment until her count of c@@ d@@ 4 t-@@ hel@@ per cells , a type of white blood cell used by the immune system , had dropped below a certain threshold .
after walking several miles to get her count checked , she arrived at the clinic only to find its testing machine broken .
the machine was still in@@ operative the second time she made the long journey .
only months later , after her third trip to the clinic on foot , did she receive her cell count : her levels were far below the necessary threshold .
her treatment should have begun months before .
since hiv / aids was first identified in 1984 , it has killed more than 35 million people .
although the number of aids-@@ related deaths has fallen by almost half since pe@@ aking in 2005 , there are still far too many people dying from this preventable condition .
in 20@@ 16 alone , one million people around the world died from hiv-@@ related causes , while 1.@@ 8 million more became infected . contrary to popular myth , we have not turned the corner on aids – not by a long shot .
world aids day , on december 1 , is an occasion to honor the millions of victims , and to re@@ commit to ending this devastating disease .
according to unaids , just 54 % of hiv-positive adults , and only 43 % of hiv-positive children , are currently receiving the antiretro@@ viral therapies that save lives and prevent new infections .
with so many un@@ treated patients , the virus will continue to spread .
as ceo of a global pharmaceutical company , i ’ m proud of the work we have done to fight hiv / aids around the world .
today , more than eight million people – nearly half of all patients receiving treatment for hiv in developing countries – depend on the antiretro@@ viral treatments that we produce .
but for those of us on the front lines of this struggle , our work is far from over .
the pharmaceutical industry has a responsibility to expand access to testing and treatment , and to help stop the spread of hiv once and for all .
fulfilling four key commit@@ ments will make this goal achie@@ vable .
for star@@ ters , pharmaceutical companies should do more to increase the availability of low-cost , generic medicines .
my company , my@@ lan , introduced the first generic on@@ ce-@@ daily pill for developing countries in 2009 , and we have continually reduced its price to make it more accessible to more people .
with this treatment alone , my@@ lan and other generic manufacturers save the us government , international donors , and national health programs more than $ 4.@@ 5 billion a year .
still , treatment options could be expanded further .
in september , my@@ lan announced a collaboration with unaids , the bill &amp; mel@@ inda gates foundation , the clinton health access initiative , and other partners to provide the nex@@ t-@@ generation single-@@ pill hiv regi@@ men to patients in more than 90 low@@ - and middle-@@ income countries for less than $ 75 per year .
these drugs are widely used in high-@@ income countries because they produce fewer side effects .
next , drug makers must continue investing in capacity and sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ chain reli@@ ability .
since 2005 , the number of people on antiretro@@ viral therapies worldwide has grown by a factor of ten , to 21 million .
but roughly twice as many people are currently infected with hiv .
over the last decade , my@@ lan has invested more than $ 250 million in expanding production capacity , and we now produce four billion tab@@ lets and capsu@@ les each year .
but further investments are needed if we are to provide access to the other 21 million people still not on treatment .
a third ur@@ gently needed commitment is to increase support for research that acceler@@ ates the development of new innovations in effective and efficient treatment delivery .
for example , my@@ lan provides study medications to research trials , like the max@@ art trial in swa@@ z@@ iland , which demonstrated that providing treatment to all hiv-positive people is the best way to slow the disease ’ s spread .
we also supported the kir@@ by institute ’ s en@@ cor@@ e@@ 1 trial , to develop a redu@@ ce@@ d-@@ dose version of the most commonly used hiv treatment regi@@ men .
and we are currently working with the us agency for international development as part of a partnership called optimize , which aims to accelerate access to new therapies .
we do not support trials like these because we hope to gain any market@@ able intellectual property – we won ’ t .
rather , we support them because it is the right way to advance science and improve treatment .
finally , real gains in the fight against hiv / aids will require drug makers to account for the limitations of heal@@ th-@@ care systems and distribution networks in the developing countries they serve .
antiretro@@ viral therapies for children are a good example of these challenges .
but developing countries often have limited col@@ d-@@ storage capacities or an inability to transport liquid in bulk .
that ’ s why my@@ lan has developed he@@ at-@@ stable , ta@@ ste@@ -@@ ma@@ sk@@ ed , dis@@ persi@@ ble tab@@ lets that can easily be incorpor@@ ated into food .
our scientists are now working on the nex@@ t-@@ generation formula , which comes in the equivalent of a sugar pac@@ ket that even new@@ bor@@ ns can take .
more innovations like these will be needed to solve the countr@@ y-@@ specific issues that patients face .
the global health community has made remarkable progress in turning the tide on hiv / aids , introducing new products and advoc@@ ating for earlier treatment .
but when i think back to the woman i met in tanzania , i am reminded of how much work remains to be done .
makers of generic medicines have an important role to play in this fight , and we will not stop working until treatment is available to every patient in the world who needs it .
the risk of a new economic non-@@ order
london – next month , when finance ministers and central bank gover@@ nor@@ s from more than 180 countries gather in washington , dc , for the annual meetings of the international mon@@ etary fund and the world bank , they will confront a global economic order under increasing strain .
having failed to deliver the inclusive economic prosperity of which it is capable , that order is subject to growing doub@@ ts – and moun@@ ting challenges .
bar@@ ring a course correc@@ tion , the risks that today ’ s order will yield to a world economic non-@@ order will only intensi@@ fy .
the current international economic order , spe@@ ar@@ headed by the united states and its allies in the wake of world war ii , is under@@ pinn@@ ed by multi@@ lat@@ eral institutions , including the imf and the world bank .
these institutions were designed to cry@@ stalli@@ ze member countries ’ obli@@ ga@@ tions , and they embodied a set of best econom@@ ic@@ -@@ policy practices that evolved into what became known as the “ washington consensus . ”
that consensus was rooted in an economic paradigm that aimed to promote win-win interactions among countries , emphasi@@ zing trade liber@@ alization , relatively un@@ restricted cross-@@ border capital flows , free-@@ market pricing , and domestic deregu@@ lation .
all of this stood in stark contrast to what developed behind the iron cur@@ tain and in china over the first half of the post@@ war period .
for several decades , the western@@ -@@ led international order func@@ tioned well , helping to deliver prosperity and relative financial stability .
then it was sha@@ ken by a series of financial sho@@ cks that cul@@ min@@ ated in the 2008 global financial crisis , which triggered cas@@ c@@ ading economic failures that pushed the world to the edge of a devastating multi-@@ year depression .
it was the most severe economic breakdown since the great depression of the 1930s .
but the crisis did not appear out of nowhere to challenge a healthy economic order .
on the contrary , the evolution of the global order had long been out@@ pac@@ ed by structural economic changes on the ground , with multi@@ lat@@ eral governance institutions taking too long to recognize fully the significance of finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ sector developments and their impact on the real economy , or to make adequate room for emerging economies .
for example , governance structures , including voting power , correspond better to the economic realities of yesterday than to those of today and tomorrow .
and nation@@ ality , rather than mer@@ it , still is the dominant guide for the appointment of these institutions ’ leaders , with top positions still reserved for european and us citizens .
the dest@@ abili@@ zing consequences of this ob@@ stin@@ ate failure to reform suffici@@ ently multi@@ lat@@ eral governance have been com@@ po@@ unded by china ’ s own struggle to reconcile its domestic priorities with its global economic responsibilities as the world ’ s second-@@ largest economy .
several other countries , particularly among the advanced economies , have also failed to transform their domestic policies to account for changes to economic relationships resul@@ ting from globalization , liber@@ alization , and deregu@@ lation .
as a result of all of this , the balance of winners and los@@ ers has become increasingly extreme and more difficult to manage , not just economically , but also politically and socially .
with too many people feeling margin@@ alized , forgotten , and dis@@ poss@@ essed – and angry at the leaders and institutions that have allowed this to happen – domestic policy pressure has intensi@@ fied , causing countries to turn in@@ ward .
this tendency is reflected in recent challenges to several features of the economic order , such as the north american free-@@ trade agreement , as well as america ’ s with@@ dra@@ wal from the trans@@ -@@ pacific partnership and the united kingdom ’ s ren@@ un@@ ci@@ ation of european union mem@@ ber@@ ship .
all are casting a shadow on the future of the global economic system .
america ’ s in@@ ward turn , already underway for several years , has been particularly con@@ sequ@@ ential , because it leaves the world order without a main conductor .
with no other country or group of countries anywhere close to being in a position to carry the bat@@ on , the emergence of what the political scientist ian bre@@ mmer has called a “ g-@@ zero era ” becomes a lot more probable .
china is responding to the global system ’ s weak@@ ening core by accelerating its efforts to build small networks , including around the traditional western@@ -@@ dominated power structures .
this has included the establishment of the asian infrastructure investment bank , the proliferation of bil@@ ateral payments agre@@ ements , and the pursuit of the “ belt and road initiative ” to build infrastructure linking china with western asia , europe , and africa .
these dynamics are sto@@ king trade ten@@ sions and raising the risk of economic frag@@ mentation .
if this trend continues , the global economic and financial configuration will become increasingly unstable , ampli@@ fying geo@@ political and security threats at a time when better cross-@@ border coordination is vital to address threats from non-@@ state actors and disruptive regimes , such as north korea .
over time , the risks associated with this shift toward a global economic non-@@ order could have severe ad@@ verse effects on geo@@ politics and national security .
none of this is new .
yet , year after year , top government officials at the imf / world bank annual meetings fail to address it .
this year is likely to be no different .
instead of discussing concrete steps to slow and reverse the march toward a global economic non-@@ order , officials will probably welcome the cycli@@ cal up@@ tick in global growth and urge member countries to do more to remove structural im@@ pedi@@ ments to faster , more durable , and more inclusive growth .
while understandable , that isn ’ t good enough .
the up@@ coming meetings offer a critical opportunity to start a serious discussion of how to arrest the lo@@ se-@@ lose dynamics that have been gaining tra@@ ction in the global economy .
the longer it takes for the seeds of reform to be so@@ wn , the less likely they will be to take root – and the higher the probability that a lo@@ se-@@ lose world economic non-@@ order will emerge .
poverty beyond the numbers
as@@ un@@ ci@@ ó@@ n – what is poverty ?
for decades , we have defined it with a number , which the world bank currently puts at a personal income of less than $ 1.@@ 90 per day .
but a single number fails to capture the complexity of poverty .
measuring more than just income is essential to understanding the needs of poor people and delivering optimal assistance .
as the world bank conven@@ es its spring meetings in washington , dc next week , we have an opportunity to set bench@@ marks that include social and environmental dimensions of poverty .
the bank has acknowled@@ ged that more than income should be considered , and recently established a commission on global poverty to recommend additional metrics .
although many public and private groups already collect data on a range of issues affecting poor communities such as nutrition , maternal health , or access to education , such information remains largely un@@ tapped and is rarely shared across institutions .
but there are some be@@ ac@@ ons of light , including the social progress index , which provides a framework for tracking multiple symptoms of poverty across countries and comple@@ ments traditional in@@ com@@ e-@@ based measures .
when we rely on a single number to measure poverty , we mis@@ diagnose the needs of poor people .
in my home country , para@@ guay , i work with one of the country ’ s largest social enter@@ pris@@ es , fund@@ aci@@ ó@@ n para@@ gu@@ aya , to provide micro@@ finance , education , and training to thousands of our poorest citizens .
we look at 50 metrics across six dimensions of poverty , including income , housing , education , and infrastructure .
one of our clients , do@@ ñ@@ a mer@@ ce@@ des , is now a successful micro-@@ entrepreneur from a rural community not far from the capital city of as@@ un@@ ci@@ ó@@ n .
when she first started with fund@@ aci@@ ó@@ n para@@ gu@@ aya , she was sharing a single-@@ bedroom home with 16 other family members and cooking meals on a small fire pit on the dirt floor .
now she has a cement floor , a brick house , a separate kitchen , and around $ 500 in personal savings .
while traditional approaches focus largely on esti@@ mating the sources of household expen@@ ses and income , the fund@@ aci@@ ó@@ n para@@ gu@@ aya self-@@ evaluation helped do@@ ñ@@ a mer@@ ce@@ des break down her needs into 50 dis@@ crete areas that she could work on , piece by piece , and monitor over time .
for example , she self-@@ evalu@@ ated the state of her bathroom and kitchen , the quality of the food eaten at home , the family ’ s dental health , the number of separate bedro@@ oms in the house , and even her self-esteem and decision-making capacity .
next she plans to add two more bedro@@ oms to her house and to work on en@@ lar@@ ging her business .
fund@@ aci@@ ó@@ n para@@ gu@@ aya has been able to replicate this type of success in other parts of the world .
in tanzania , where i worked for three years in rural communities , we helped villages in the southern highl@@ ands adapt our poverty indi@@ cators to the local context in order to tackle water , sanitation , and electri@@ fication needs .
similar efforts are being deployed in south africa , nigeria , uganda , china , and beyond .
we could make even more progress with publi@@ c-@@ sector support .
fund@@ aci@@ ó@@ n para@@ gu@@ aya colle@@ cts rich data across multiple dimensions , tracking more than 8,@@ 700 families each year in para@@ guay alone .
if this information were to reach the government of para@@ guay – which has its own methods for collecting data – we could identify pockets of poverty sooner and custom@@ ize programs to help each family .
because the information is self-@@ reported , this sort of collaboration could deliver targeted aid and highlight specific public services that are needed .
moreover , if the world bank ’ s commission on global poverty adop@@ ts multi@@ dimensional poverty measures , it will spur other organizations to produce and share more detailed poverty data .
that will give aid workers a more comprehensive poverty map of the world , helping to boost the effectiveness of anti-@@ poverty efforts everywhere .
it won ’ t be easy to choose which measures to include , or even how to set universal y@@ ar@@ d@@ sticks ; but even adopting a few basic ones would spur progress .
for too long , one-@@ dimensional measures such as the $ 1.@@ 90 per day guidel@@ ine have mis@@ diagnosed poor people ’ s problems – and more importantly , their causes .
we know that the $ 1.@@ 90 per day bench@@ mark does not fully capture the strug@@ gles of poor people in places such as para@@ guay .
fortunately , the world bank now appears to recognize the limits of its in@@ com@@ e-@@ based indic@@ ator .
en@@ suring that the right type of aid reaches those most in need in a tim@@ ely and effective manner requires development policymakers to embrace the type of multi@@ dimensional poverty data that aid organizations like fund@@ aci@@ ó@@ n para@@ gu@@ aya have learned to gather .
the sky is not falling
vienna – humans are partial to bad news .
media out@@ lets reflect and shape this preference , feeding us wo@@ e and panic .
long , slow , positive trends don ’ t make it to the front page or to wat@@ er-@@ cooler conversations .
so we develop peculiar mis@@ perceptions , especially the idea that a pre@@ pon@@ der@@ ance of things are going wrong .
when i published the skeptical environment@@ alist in 2001 , i pointed out that the world was getting better in many respects .
back then , this was viewed as her@@ esy , as it punc@@ tured several common and cher@@ ished mis@@ perceptions , such as the idea that natural resources were running out , that an ever-@@ growing population was leaving less to eat , and that air and water were becoming ever-@@ more polluted .
in each case , careful exam@@ ination of the data established that the glo@@ omy scenarios prevail@@ ing at the time were exagger@@ ated .
while fish stocks , for example , are deple@@ ted because of a lack of regulation , we can actually eat more fish than ever , thanks to the ad@@ vent of aqu@@ ac@@ ulture .
worries that we are losing forests over@@ look the reality that as countries become richer , they increase their forest cover .
since i wrote the book , the world has only become better , according to many important indi@@ cators .
we have continued to see meaningful reduc@@ tions in infant mortality and malnutrition , and there have been massive stri@@ des toward eradication of polio , meas@@ les , malaria , and il@@ literacy .
by focusing on the most lethal environmental problem – air pollution – we can see some of the reasons for improvement .
as the world developed , deaths from air pollution have declined dramatically , and that trend is likely to continue .
looking at a polluted city in a country like china might suggest otherwise , but the air inside the homes of most poor people is about ten times more polluted than the worst outdoor air in beijing .
the most serious environmental problem for humans is indoor air pollution from cooking and heating with dirty fuels like wood and dung – which is the result of poverty .
in 1900 , more than 90 % of all air pollution deaths resulted from indoor air pollution .
economic development has meant more outdoor pollution , but also much less indoor pollution .
reduc@@ tions in poverty have gone hand in hand with a four-@@ fold reduction in global air pollution mortality .
yet more people today still die from indoor air pollution than from outdoor pollution .
even in china , while outside air has become a lot more polluted , poverty reduction has caused a lower risk of total air pollution death .
and as countries become richer , they can afford to regulate and cut even outdoor air pollution .
two hundred years ago , almost every person on the planet lived in poverty , and a tiny elite in luxury .
today just 9.@@ 1 % of the population , or almost 700 million people , lives on less than $ 1.@@ 90 per day ( or what used to be one dollar in 1985 ) .
and just in the last 20 years , the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has almost hal@@ ved .
yet few of us know this .
the gapminder foundation surve@@ yed the uk and found that just 10 % of people believe poverty has decreased .
in south africa and in sweden , more people believe extreme poverty has doubled than believe – correctly – that it has plum@@ me@@ ted .
how do we continue our swi@@ ft progress ?
there has been no shortage of well-@@ inten@@ tioned policy interventions , so we have decades of data showing what works well and what doesn ’ t .
in the lat@@ ter category , even well-@@ considered ideas from the world ’ s most em@@ in@@ ent thinkers can fall short .
the ambitious millennium villages concept was supposed to create simul@@ taneous progress on multiple fron@@ ts , producing “ major results in three or fewer years , ” according to founder je@@ ff@@ rey d. sachs .
but a study by the united kingdom ’ s department for international development shows the villages had “ moder@@ ately positive impacts , ” and “ little overall impact on poverty . ”
it ’ s more construc@@ tive to focus on what works .
global analysis of development targets for copenhagen consensus by a panel of nobel laure@@ ate economists showed where more money can achieve the most .
they concluded that improved access to contra@@ ception and famil@@ y-@@ planning services would reduce maternal and child mortality , and also – through a demographic divi@@ dend – increase economic growth .
likewise , research ass@@ essing the best development policies for haiti found that focusing on improvements in nutrition through the use of for@@ ti@@ fied fl@@ our would transform the health of young children , creating lifelong benefits .
other copenhagen consensus research suggests that scaling up government e-@@ pro@@ cu@@ rement platforms would be transformative .
this may sound tan@@ gen@@ tial to poverty reduction , but it ’ s not .
on average , developing countries use half their budgets on pro@@ cu@@ rement ; enabling transparent competition could reduce losses caused by corruption .
this is not mere specu@@ lation .
a case study in bangladesh , which spends more than $ 9 billion on public pro@@ cu@@ rement annu@@ ally , found that pil@@ oting e-@@ pro@@ cu@@ rement in just one government department lower@@ ed prices by 12 % , leaving more resources for other important budget priorities .
the research shows that expanding digital pro@@ cu@@ rement govern@@ ment-@@ wide would save $ 6@@ 70 million annu@@ ally – enough to increase annual publi@@ c-@@ health spending by about 50 % .
the banglades@@ hi government is now fast-@@ tracking this expansion .
and the most powerful weapon in the fight against poverty is the one that got us where we are today : broad@@ -based economic growth .
over the past 30 years , china ’ s growth spur@@ t alone lifted an unprecedented 6@@ 80 million people above the poverty line .
a global trade agreement – such as a successful conclusion to the st@@ alled doha round – would lift another 160 million people out of poverty .
skep@@ ticism toward free trade hurts the world ’ s poorest .
while other us policies and tweets by president don@@ ald trum@@ p get far more coverage , the current administration ’ s reje@@ ction of free trade could be the biggest tragedy .
humanity ’ s success in reducing poverty is an extraordinary achievement , and one that we are far too re@@ tic@@ ent about acknowled@@ ging .
we need to make sure that we don ’ t lose sight of what got us this far – and what justi@@ fies the hope of an even better future .
why the world cup ma@@ ttered
paris – the sevent@@ e@@ enth@@ -@@ century philosopher and sati@@ r@@ ist jean de la bru@@ y@@ è@@ re once qui@@ pped that , “ cor@@ nei@@ lle portra@@ ys men as they should be , ra@@ c@@ ine depic@@ ts them as they are . ” for europeans , and even more so for the french , the 20@@ 18 world cup was a cor@@ nei@@ lli@@ an event .
the month-@@ long soccer tour@@ nam@@ ent in russia offered an en@@ chan@@ ted res@@ pite from a tu@@ mul@@ tu@@ ous world and revealed the better angels of our nature .
in the counter-@@ reality of the tour@@ nam@@ ent , a mood of self-@@ confidence , altruism , and openness to the “ other ” prevail@@ ed .
at least for a while , the chau@@ vin@@ ism , ali@@ en@@ ation , and despair that have dominated this era of popu@@ list nation@@ alism seemed to be forgotten .
geographi@@ cally speaking , all four of the semi@@ fin@@ alists – france , cro@@ a@@ tia , bel@@ gi@@ um , and england – ha@@ iled from the old continent .
den@@ ounce europe for its supposed weakness and deca@@ dence all you want . when it comes to the world ’ s most popular sport , europe is king .
moreover , it is clear that africa is the soccer continent of the future , whereas latin america is the continent of the past .
having won the cup in 19@@ 30 and again in 1950 , uruguay was once the smallest country ( by population ) to reach the final .
but that honor is now shared by the brave team fiel@@ ded by cro@@ a@@ tia , the ne@@ west eu member state .
in stark contrast to the “ real world , ” the two leading powers , the united states and china , played no role in the tour@@ nam@@ ent .
former us secretary of state henry kis@@ singer ’ s dream of turning the us into a great soccer power has proved to be more difficult than he had hoped .
and china under president x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping remains a soccer lightweight , despite having invested billions of dollars in the sport .
instead , north america was represented with bri@@ o by mexico , and asia by japan and south korea .
the strange divergence between the real world and the world of soccer this year was also evident in expressions of nation@@ alist emotion .
the great argent@@ ini@@ an writer jor@@ ge lu@@ is bor@@ ges once con@@ dem@@ ned the sport for its role in fu@@ eling toxic forms of nation@@ alism ( such as the short-@@ lived “ football war ” between hon@@ dur@@ as and el sal@@ v@@ ad@@ or in 1969 ) .
but in the 20@@ 18 world cup – a century after the end of the nation@@ alist blood@@ bath that was world war i – a “ soft , ” even gentle nation@@ alism prevail@@ ed .
russia is hardly an expon@@ ent of soft power , yet it deserves credit for the absence of violence during the tour@@ nam@@ ent .
international press reports showed ukra@@ ini@@ an and russian fans fr@@ ater@@ ni@@ zing like old friends .
whereas the vietnam war@@ -@@ era wood@@ stock festival exem@@ pli@@ fied the slogan “ make love , not war , ” the de fac@@ to slogan of the 20@@ 18 cup seems to have been “ balls , not bombs . ”
in addition to channel@@ ing a more construc@@ tive form of nation@@ alism , the semi@@ fin@@ alists and their fans also embodied effective collective action , altruism , openness , and tolerance .
interestingly , the teams that reli@@ ed on a single star player – whether cri@@ sti@@ ano ron@@ al@@ do of portugal , li@@ on@@ el mess@@ i of argentina , or ne@@ y@@ mar of brazil – all failed to advance beyond the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als .
in the real world nowadays , people are increasingly temp@@ ted to ere@@ ct walls and close themselves off from “ others . ”
and yet , the strength of the winning team , france , was in its diversity .
this year ’ s chant of “ liber@@ t@@ é , egal@@ it@@ é , m@@ ba@@ pp@@ é ” ( for the 19@@ -year-old french forward ky@@ lian m@@ ba@@ pp@@ é ) was a more enlightened version of the slogan from france ’ s victory in 1998 : “ zi@@ dan@@ e for president . ”
although there have been limited strikes against french president emmanuel ma@@ cr@@ on ’ s reform agenda , these comm@@ ent@@ ators got it wrong .
the closest parallel to this year is not 1968 or 1995 , but 1998 , when france first won the world cup .
domest@@ ically , france ’ s victory likely will have little effect , if any , on ma@@ cr@@ on ’ s popul@@ arity .
no one can deny that “ france is back , ” at least in terms of soccer .
the country has emerged as an o@@ asis of dynam@@ ism , re@@ alism , and you@@ thful enthusiasm , much of which is also reflected in ma@@ cr@@ on himself .
an obvious fo@@ il is germany .
usually a soccer power@@ house , the german team was eliminated in the first round of this year ’ s tour@@ nam@@ ent , just as its politics were entering a deeper mal@@ a@@ ise .
in geo@@ political terms , if one were to name just two winners this year , the titles would have to go to russia and france .
world cup her@@ alds a new korea
the eu@@ ph@@ ori@@ a of fans whose team wins a major sporting event is ep@@ he@@ mer@@ al .
but , promin@@ ent professors at korean universities tell me that the unprecedented success of the korean team in the current world cup competition is causing a turning point in korean attitudes towards their own society and economy .
why ?
many kore@@ ans , especially those who studied or lived in the west , complain about the &quot; cr@@ ony@@ ism &quot; , and the resul@@ ting importance of &quot; connections &quot; in all walks of korean life , which they see as pervasive features of korean society .
they claim that such ramp@@ ant cr@@ ony@@ ism is preventing korea from catching up economically with the west , despite the fact that korea soon will have as much human capital as western countries .
to understand korean cr@@ ony@@ ism we have to see it as one aspect of a set of related social conven@@ tions .
kore@@ ans accept a sense of knowing one &apos;s place in society that seems extreme to americans .
in social interactions , and also in business de@@ al@@ ings , kore@@ ans maintain a hierarchy that seems to weigh age more highly than performance .
also , although ad@@ mission to elite universities is as merito@@ cratic in korea as in the west , the outcome of the university entrance competition has a more important and more permanent effect on one &apos;s place in korean society .
it is only a slight exagger@@ ation to say that in america people have to prove themselves continually , whereas in traditional korean society people have only to prove themselves once , then they can be set for life due in large measure to the network of cr@@ ony contacts that initial success will have provided .
what do korean cr@@ ony@@ ism and related social conven@@ tions have to do with the world cup ?
in the past cr@@ ony@@ ism apparently has been as pervasive in the selection of korean teams for international sports competi@@ tions as in other areas of korean society .
but , two years ago when the korean soccer football association hired the du@@ tch@@ man , gu@@ us hi@@ d@@ din@@ k , to coach the korean national soccer team , hi@@ d@@ din@@ k made it clear that he would select his players based on mer@@ it alone .
the performance of the korean team in the 2002 world cup competition is demonstrating to every korean in a way that is easily seen that merito@@ cracy yields better results than cr@@ ony@@ ism .
it also helps that hi@@ d@@ din@@ k has been able to use his co@@ aching skills to bring out in his team the strengths of the korean national character : intelligence , discipline , ten@@ acity , and per@@ sever@@ ance .
of course , korean tradition@@ alists reject criticism of what we@@ ster@@ ni@@ zed kore@@ ans call cr@@ ony@@ ism .
tradition@@ alists argue that criticism of cr@@ ony@@ ism is really criticism of social solidar@@ ity and responsibility , which they see as positive features of korean society .
tradition@@ alists also argue that merito@@ cracy impli@@ es individu@@ alism , and that too much individu@@ alism and too little social solidar@@ ity and responsibility are negative features of western society .
some tradition@@ alists even might claim that they do not want kore@@ ans to be as rich as westerners if that requires kore@@ ans to be as individu@@ alistic as westerners .
the hi@@ d@@ din@@ k phenomenon did not emerge suddenly out of thin air .
the accumulation of gradu@@ al changes that have already occurred in korean society made it acceptable to import a western@@ er to coach the korean national soccer team and to allow him to establish a merito@@ cratic regime .
but hi@@ d@@ din@@ k has expedi@@ ted the process of change within korean society , and his success has made it look revolutionary .
it remains to be seen how fast , in what ways , and with what effects , korean society will continue to change .
kore@@ ans are talking about learning the lessons of hi@@ d@@ din@@ k . but the western model of a merito@@ cratic society is not easy to emu@@ late .
a soccer team is a relatively simple organization .
imple@@ menting the lessons of hi@@ d@@ din@@ k throughout korean society will present more difficult challenges .
whatever the outcome , it seems that in the case of the 2002 world cup the effects of success in a major sporting event will not be ep@@ he@@ mer@@ al .
the world economy in 20@@ 18
stanford – all major macro@@ economic indi@@ cators – growth , unemployment , and inflation – suggest that 20@@ 17 will be the american economy ’ s best year in a decade .
and the global economy is enjoying broad , synchroni@@ zed growth beyond what anyone expected .
the question now is whether this strong performance will continue in 20@@ 18 .
the answer , of course , will depend on mon@@ etary , fiscal , trade , and related policies in the united states and around the world .
and yet it is hard to predict what policy pro@@ pos@@ als will emerge in 20@@ 18 .
there are relatively new heads of state in the us , france , and the united kingdom ; german leaders still have not formed a gover@@ ning coalition since the general election in september ; and the us federal reserve has a new chair a@@ waiting confir@@ mation .
moreover , major changes in important developing economies such as argentina , saudi arabia , and brazil have made the future out@@ look even mur@@ ki@@ er .
still , we should hope for the best .
first and foremost , we should hope that synchroni@@ zed global growth at a rate of just under 4 % will continue in 20@@ 18 , as the international mon@@ etary fund projected in october .
growth not only raises incomes , but also makes v@@ ex@@ ing problems such as bad bank loans and budget defic@@ its more manage@@ able .
as former us president john f@@ . kennedy famously said in an october 196@@ 3 speech in which he promot@@ ed his proposed corporate and personal tax reduc@@ tions , “ a rising tide li@@ fts all boats . ”
for my part , i predict that the global recovery will continue , but at a slightly slower growth rate of around 3.5 % .
the two most obvious risks to keep an eye on will be europe , where a cycli@@ cal up@@ turn could stall , and the o@@ il-@@ rich middle east , where ten@@ sions could fl@@ are up once again .
second , let us hope that the fed , guided by the steady hand of its new chair , jer@@ ome “ jay ” po@@ well , will continue or even accelerate its mon@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ policy norm@@ alization , both by raising its bench@@ mark federal funds rate , and by shrinking its eng@@ or@@ ged balance sheet .
and we should hope that economic conditions allow the other major central banks , especially the european central bank , to follow suit .
on this front , i predict that the major central banks will continue to norm@@ alize mon@@ etary policies more gradually than is necessary .
the biggest risk here is that markets may try to test the fed under its new leadership , for example , if inflation rises faster than anticipated .
third , let us hope that the republican tax package will , if en@@ acted , deliver on its promise of increased investment , output , productivity , and wages over the coming decade .
here , i predict that the legislation will pass , and that investment in the us over the next few years will be relatively higher than if no action had been taken .
to be sure , whether investment will rise from its currently sub@@ du@@ ed level will depend on many other factors than the corpor@@ at@@ e-@@ tax rate .
but the tax package can still be expected to boost output , productivity , and wages .
the question is not if , but when .
if the full effects of the legislation are not felt before the 20@@ 18 or 2020 elections , that lag could prove politically con@@ sequ@@ ential .
the biggest danger is that its benefits will be del@@ a@@ yed , and that its key pro@@ visions will be rever@@ sed whenever the democrats are back in power .
fourth , let us hope that governments everywhere begin to address the lo@@ oming crisis in publi@@ c-@@ pension and heal@@ th-@@ care costs , which have been rising for decades .
as social programs become co@@ st@@ lier , they crowd out government expen@@ di@@ tures on necessi@@ ties such as defense , while generating ever more pressure to impose higher grow@@ th-@@ supp@@ ressing taxes .
europe , in particular , must not let its cycli@@ cal re@@ bound l@@ ull it into com@@ plac@@ ency .
many european union member states still need to reduce their government debt , and the euro@@ zone needs to resolve its “ z@@ om@@ bie bank ” crisis .
beyond that , structural labor@@ -@@ market reforms of the kind french president emmanuel ma@@ cr@@ on is pursuing would be most welcome .
unfortunately , i ’ m afraid that progress on structural reforms will be spo@@ radi@@ c , at best .
the danger is that slow growth will not lead to sufficient wage gains and job creation to def@@ use the ticking time bomb of high youth unemployment in many countries .
another risk is that reform attempts could provo@@ ke a political bac@@ klas@@ h that would be harmful to long-term investment .
fifth , let us hope that the euro@@ zone can avoid a currency crisis .
this will depend largely on whether german chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a mer@@ kel can form a coalition government and restore political stability to europe ’ s largest economy .
sixth , we should hope that the eu and the uk can agree on a reasonable bre@@ x@@ it deal that will preserve fairly strong trade relations .
the main risk here is that loc@@ alized dec@@ lines in trade could spill over and cause broader harm .
and , beyond europe , let us hope that negotiations between the us , canada , and mexico over the north american free trade agreement ( na@@ ft@@ a ) will result in an arrangement that still facili@@ tates contin@@ ental trade .
for trade generally , the biggest risk is that the trum@@ p administration could start a lo@@ se-@@ lose trade dispute , o@@ wing to its understandable ea@@ ger@@ ness to help american manufacturing workers .
seventh , let us hope that new policies targe@@ ting information and communication technology ( ic@@ t ) strike the right balance among all stake@@ holders ’ competing and legitimate concerns .
on one hand , there is reason to worry about certain internet companies ’ concentration of market power , particularly in online content and distribution , and about the effects of new technologies on personal privacy , law en@@ for@@ cement , and national security .
on the other hand , new technological advances could deliver immense economic gains .
it is easy to envision a scenario of too much regulation , or of too little .
it is also easy to envision a large-scale public bac@@ klas@@ h against the major technology companies , particularly if poor self-@@ policing or a ref@@ us@@ al to cooperate with law en@@ for@@ cement leads to some horrible event .
here , i predict that achieving an appropriate policy balance will take years .
if some future event strikes an emotional chord , the public ’ s mood could swing dramatically .
ultimately , however , i suspect that competition and innovation will survive the for@@ th@@ coming regulations .
finally , and most important , let us hope that terrorism is th@@ war@@ ted everywhere , conflicts sub@@ side , democracy and capitalism regain some momentum , and greater civili@@ ty and honest dialogue return to the public domain .
should that happen in 20@@ 18 , it will be a very good year indeed .
the world economy without china
new haven – is the chinese economy about to im@@ plo@@ de ?
with its debt over@@ hangs and property bubbles , its z@@ om@@ bie state-@@ owned enter@@ pris@@ es and struggling banks , china is increasingly portra@@ yed as the next disaster in a cris@@ is-@@ prone world .
i remain convinced that such fears are over@@ blown , and that china has the strategy , where@@ with@@ al , and commitment to achieve a dramatic structural transformation into a ser@@ vic@@ es-@@ based consumer society while successfully dod@@ ging daunting cycli@@ cal head@@ winds .
but i certainly recognize that this is now a minority opinion .
for example , us treas@@ ury secretary jac@@ ob j. le@@ w continues to express the rather puzz@@ ling view that the united states “ can ’ t be the only engine in the world economy . ”
actually , it ’ s not : the chinese economy is on track to contribute well over four times as much to global growth as the us this year .
but maybe le@@ w is already assuming the worst for china in his assessment of the world economy .
so what if the china doub@@ ters are right ?
what if china ’ s economy does indeed come crash@@ ing down , with its growth rate pl@@ ung@@ ing into low single digits , or even negative territory , as would be the case in most crisis economies ?
china would suffer , of course , but so would an al@@ read@@ y-@@ sha@@ ky global economy .
with all the hand@@ wr@@ inging over the chinese economy , it ’ s worth considering this thought experiment in detail .
for star@@ ters , without china , the world economy would already be in recession .
china ’ s growth rate this year appears set to hit 6.@@ 7 % – consider@@ ably higher than most fore@@ ca@@ sters have been expecting .
according to the international mon@@ etary fund – the official arbit@@ er of global economic metrics – the chinese economy accounts for 17@@ .@@ 3 % of world gdp ( measured on a purch@@ as@@ ing-@@ power-@@ par@@ ity basis ) .
a 6.@@ 7 % increase in chinese real gdp thus translates into about 1.2 percentage points of world growth .
ab@@ sent china , that contribution would need to be subtra@@ cted from the imf ’ s down@@ war@@ dly re@@ vised 3.@@ 1 % estimate for world gdp growth in 20@@ 16 , dragging it down to 1.@@ 9 % – well below the 2.5 % threshold commonly associated with global rec@@ essions .
of course , that ’ s just the direct effect of a world without china .
then there are cross-@@ border link@@ ages with other major economies .
the so-called resource economies – namely , australia , new zealand , canada , russia , and brazil – would be hit especially hard .
as a resour@@ ce-@@ intensive growth jug@@ ger@@ n@@ aut , china has transformed these economies , which collectively account for nearly 9 % of world gdp .
while all of them argue that they have diversi@@ fied economic structures that are not over@@ ly dependent on chinese commodity demand , currency markets say otherwise : whenever china ’ s growth expectations are re@@ vised – upward or down@@ ward – their exchange rates move in tan@@ dem .
the imf currently projects that these five economies will contract by a combined 0.@@ 7 % in 20@@ 16 , reflecting ongoing rec@@ essions in russia and brazil and modest growth in the other three .
needless to say , in a china im@@ plo@@ sion scenario , this baseline estimate would be re@@ vised down@@ ward significantly .
the same would be the case for china ’ s asian trading partners – most of which remain ex@@ port-@@ dependent economies , with the chinese market their largest source of external demand .
that is true not only of smaller asian developing economies such as indonesia , the philippines , and thailand , but also of the larger and more developed economies in the region , such as japan , korea , and taiwan .
collectively , these six chin@@ a-@@ dependent asian economies make up another 11 % of world gdp .
a china im@@ plo@@ sion could easily knock at least one percentage point off their combined growth rate .
the united states is also a case in point .
china is america ’ s third-@@ largest and most rapidly growing export market .
in a chin@@ a-@@ im@@ plo@@ sion scenario , that export demand would all but dry up – kno@@ cking approximately 0.@@ 2-@@ 0.@@ 3 percentage points off already sub@@ p@@ ar us economic growth of around 1.@@ 6 % in 20@@ 16 .
finally , there is europe to consider .
growth in germany , long the engine of an otherwise sc@@ ler@@ otic contin@@ ental economy , remains heavily dependent on exports .
that is due increasingly to the importance of china – now germany ’ s third-@@ largest export market , after the european union and the united states .
in a china im@@ plo@@ sion scenario , german economic growth could also be significantly lower , dragging down the rest of a ger@@ man-@@ led europe .
interestingly , in its ju@@ st-@@ released october update of the world economic out@@ look , the imf de@@ votes an entire chapter to what it calls a china spil@@ lover analysis – a mod@@ el-@@ based assessment of the global impacts of a china slow@@ down .
consistent with the arguments above , the imf focuses on link@@ ages to commodity expor@@ ters , asian expor@@ ters , and what they call “ systemic advanced economies ” ( germany , japan , and the us ) that would be most exposed to a chinese down@@ turn .
by their reck@@ oning , the impact on asia would be the largest , followed closely by the resource economies ; the sensitivity of the three developed economies is estimated to be about half that of china ’ s non-@@ japan asian trading partners .
the imf research suggests that china ’ s global spil@@ lovers would add about another 25 % to the direct effects of china ’ s growth short@@ fall .
that means that if chinese economic growth van@@ ished into thin air , in accor@@ dance with our thought experiment , the sum of the direct effects ( 1.2 percentage points of global growth ) and indi@@ rect spil@@ lovers ( roughly another 0.@@ 3 percentage points ) would essentially hal@@ ve the current baseline estimate of 20@@ 16 global growth , from 3.@@ 1 % to 1.@@ 6 % .
while that would be far short of the record 0.@@ 1 % global contra@@ ction in 2009 , it wouldn ’ t be much different than two earlier deep world rec@@ essions , in 1975 ( 1 % growth ) and 1982 ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
i may be one of the only china optimi@@ sts left .
while i am hardly up@@ beat about pro@@ spe@@ cts for the global economy , i think the world faces far bigger problems than a major mel@@ t@@ down in china .
yet i would be the first to conce@@ de that a post-@@ crisis world economy without chinese growth would be in grave difficulty .
china bears need to be careful what they wish for .

like the tens of thousands who hu@@ ddle here for safety , he e@@ kes out a life for his children and grandchildren on a mu@@ ddy and in@@ ferti@@ le slope .
what his family eats depends on others , including the su@@ sten@@ ance provided by my colleagues at the world food programme .
the w@@ f@@ p is meeting emergency food needs for nearly 70@@ 0,000 roh@@ ing@@ ya , sup@@ plying nutri@@ ent-@@ rich bis@@ cu@@ its to new arri@@ vals and feeding registered residents with regular distribu@@ tions of rice , vegetable oil , and l@@ enti@@ ls .
we are also providing hot meals through community kit@@ chens and delivering supp@@ le@@ mental nutrition to pregnant women , bre@@ ast@@ feeding mothers , and young children .
the roh@@ ing@@ ya here are safe from per@@ secu@@ tion , but the threat of illness and malnutrition pursu@@ es them .
we are reminded of this every day as we com@@ b the camp to check on families receiving w@@ f@@ p support .
the sight of young children playing barefoot in fil@@ thy water , or wa@@ ding in streams flowing with human waste , is ubiquitous .
as the number of refugees grows daily , cases of malnutrition , especially among mothers and young children , are rising .
pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary findings from a joint nutrition assessment show that one in four children is mal@@ nour@@ ished , and refugees are desperate when they cross the border .
malnutrition rates were already high in northern ra@@ k@@ hine state before the roh@@ ing@@ ya fl@@ ed .
regre@@ tt@@ ably , the health of the displaced has de@@ terior@@ ated further , o@@ wing to the hard@@ ship of their journey and the conditions in which they are now living .
to prevent malnutrition from taking hold , the international community needs more resources and more funding across many sectors .
in early october , the w@@ f@@ p called for an immediate $ 77 million in emergency aid . that ple@@ a still stands , and with the depth of the suffering increasing , the need for resources grows by the day .
but food assistance alone is not enough to overcome this crisis .
poor sanitation and un@@ safe drinking water can just as easily under@@ mine health .
today , more than half of new arri@@ vals tell us that their children are already suffering from diarrhea .
once the immediate pan@@ gs of hunger are addressed , refugees need help reinventing di@@ ets with diverse , locally sourced fresh foods .
to that end , w@@ f@@ p is seeking to expand our electronic v@@ ou@@ cher program , a cash card that allows families to choose from 19 food items on the local market , including gar@@ lic , gre@@ ens , oni@@ ons , and ch@@ ili@@ es .
we are also planning to roll out an e-@@ v@@ ou@@ cher program for new refugees by early 20@@ 18 .
these initi@@ atives will empower refugees to make their own choices and shop for nutri@@ tious food on a regular basis , while supporting local businesses .
fighting malnutrition also means navi@@ gating the social realities of camp life .
it is often easier to measure malnutrition among women and children by visiting them in their shelters .
this is especially true for women without extended families , or those whose husbands may not appro@@ ve of them visiting the health center alone .
walking in the mu@@ ddy , di@@ m@@ ly lit camps can also be dangerous .
but while our staff go hut to hut to help people loc@@ ate food-@@ distribution and nutri@@ tion-@@ support centers , we struggle to reach everyone .
when people started arriving in cox ’ s ba@@ z@@ ar in late august , during the muslim ei@@ d holiday , residents showed immense generosity .
our staff heard countless stories of loc@@ als sharing the special food they had prepared for the festi@@ vi@@ ties with the hungry new arri@@ vals .
loc@@ als here are no strangers to visitors .
the magical 120 kilometers of natural beach attra@@ cts thousands of holi@@ day@@ makers every year .
refugees have also been arriving for decades , fle@@ eing previous bou@@ ts of violence in my@@ an@@ mar .
unfortunately , ei@@ d and any surplus food are now distant memories .
many loc@@ als are fishermen or rice farmers , and their resources are stretched from sharing their land , markets , and roads with the massive influ@@ x of refugees .
to reduce the potential for tension between refugees and their ho@@ sts , international aid efforts must target both communities .
in addition to meeting refugees ’ most fundamental needs , w@@ f@@ p is expanding its school feeding , nutrition , and live@@ lihood activities to the host communities .
despite the di@@ re circumstances , the people i have met in the camps are extraordinarily resilient .
women def@@ tly wea@@ ve bamboo poles into walls for their shelters .
and everywhere i look , men , women , and children – despite being weighed down by their daily loads , carrying food and fire@@ wood – are taking small steps to improve their lives .
the role of the w@@ f@@ p and the international community supporting the banglades@@ hi authorities is to ease the roh@@ ing@@ ya ’ s hard@@ ship today , and push for solutions that help them realize their aspirations tomorrow .
the return of currency wars
new york – the recent decision by the bank of japan to increase the scope of its quantitative e@@ asing is a signal that another round of currency wars may be under way .
the bo@@ j ’ s effort to wea@@ ken the yen is a beg@@ gar@@ -@@ th@@ y-@@ neighbor approach that is in@@ ducing policy reactions throughout asia and around the world .
central banks in china , south korea , taiwan , singapore , and thailand , fear@@ ful of losing competi@@ tiveness relative to japan , are e@@ asing their own mon@@ etary policies – or will soon ease more .
the european central bank and the central banks of switzerland , sweden , norway , and a few central european countries are likely to embrace quantitative e@@ asing or use other un@@ conventional policies to prevent their curren@@ cies from appreci@@ ating .
all of this will lead to a streng@@ th@@ ening of the us dollar , as growth in the united states is picking up and the federal reserve has sign@@ aled that it will begin raising interest rates next year .
but , if global growth remains weak and the dollar becomes too strong , even the fed may decide to raise interest rates later and more slowly to avoid exc@@ essive dollar appreciation .
the cause of the latest currency tur@@ mo@@ il is clear : in an environment of private and public dele@@ ver@@ aging from high deb@@ ts , mon@@ etary policy has become the only available tool to boost demand and growth .
fiscal au@@ ster@@ ity has exac@@ erb@@ ated the impact of dele@@ ver@@ aging by exer@@ ting a direct and indi@@ rect drag on growth .
lower public spending reduces aggregate demand , while declining transfers and higher taxes reduce dis@@ pos@@ able income and thus private consumption .
in the euro@@ zone , a sudden stop of capital flows to the peripher@@ y and the fiscal restra@@ ints imposed , with germany ’ s bac@@ king , by the european union , the international mon@@ etary fund , and the ec@@ b have been a massive im@@ pedi@@ ment to growth .
in japan , an exc@@ essi@@ vely front-@@ loaded consu@@ mp@@ tion-@@ tax increase killed the recovery achieved this year .
in the us , a budget sequ@@ e@@ ster and other tax and spending policies led to a sharp fiscal drag in 20@@ 12-@@ 20@@ 14 .
and in the united kingdom , self-@@ imposed fiscal con@@ soli@@ dation weak@@ ened growth until this year .
globally , the asym@@ metric adju@@ st@@ ment of credi@@ tor and deb@@ tor economies has exac@@ erb@@ ated this rec@@ essi@@ on@@ ary and de@@ fla@@ tionary spiral .
countries that were over@@ spending , under-@@ saving , and running curr@@ ent-@@ account defic@@ its have been forced by markets to spend less and save more .
as fiscal au@@ ster@@ ity and asym@@ metric adju@@ st@@ ment have taken their toll on economic performance , mon@@ etary policy has borne the burden of supporting fal@@ tering growth via weaker curren@@ cies and higher net exports .
but the resul@@ ting currency wars are partly a zero-sum game : if one currency is weaker , another currency must be stronger ; and if one country ’ s trade balance improves , another ’ s must wor@@ sen .
of course , mon@@ etary e@@ asing is not purely zero-sum .
e@@ asing can boost growth by li@@ fting asset prices ( equi@@ ties and housing ) , reducing private and public borrowing costs , and limit@@ ing the risk of a fall in actual and expected inflation .
given fiscal drag and private dele@@ ver@@ aging , lack of sufficient mon@@ etary e@@ asing in recent years would have led to double and triple dip recession ( as occurred , for example , in the euro@@ zone ) .
but the overall policy mix has been sub-@@ optimal , with too much front-@@ loaded fiscal con@@ soli@@ dation and too much un@@ conventional mon@@ etary policy ( which has become less effective over time ) .
a better approach in advanced economies would have com@@ prised less fiscal con@@ soli@@ dation in the short run and more investment in productive infrastructure , combined with a more credible commitment to medi@@ um@@ - and long-term fiscal adju@@ st@@ ment – and less aggressive mon@@ etary e@@ asing .
you can lead a horse to liqui@@ dity , but you can ’ t make it drink .
in a world where private aggregate demand is weak and un@@ conventional mon@@ etary policy eventually becomes like pushing on a string , the case for slower fiscal con@@ soli@@ dation and productive public infrastructure spending is compelling .
such spending offers returns that are certainly higher than the low interest rates that most advanced economies face today , and infrastructure needs are massive in both advanced and emerging economies ( with the exception of china , which has over@@ invested in infrastructure ) .
moreover , public investment works on both the demand and supply sides .
it not only boo@@ sts aggregate demand directly ; it also expands potential output by increasing the stock of produ@@ c@@ tivi@@ ty-@@ boo@@ sting capital .
unfortunately , the political economy of au@@ ster@@ ity has led to sub-@@ optimal outcomes .
in a fiscal crun@@ ch , the first spending cuts hit productive public investments , because governments prefer to protect current – and often inefficient – spending on publi@@ c-@@ sector jobs and transfer payments to the private sector .
as a result , the global recovery remains ane@@ mic in most advanced economies ( with the partial exception of the us and the uk ) and now also in the major emerging countries , where growth has slowed shar@@ ply in the last two years .
the right policies – less fiscal au@@ ster@@ ity in the short run , more public investment spending , and less reli@@ ance on mon@@ etary e@@ asing – are the opposite of those that have been pursu@@ ed by the world ’ s major economies .
no wonder global growth keeps on disap@@ pointing .
in a sense , we are all japanese now .
a road@@ map to end cholera
gen@@ eva – “ where is your toilet ? ” this is often the first question i ask when i visit the site of a cholera outbreak anywhere in the world .
we go wherever we can . ”
cholera , an ancient disease , has become a disease of poverty .
it does not discrimin@@ ate geographi@@ cally , but it pre@@ ys mostly on vulnerable communities in areas with poor sanitation .
carried by contaminated floo@@ d@@ waters to sources of drinking water , transported by uns@@ us@@ pe@@ cting travel@@ ers , or brought into homes on produce irri@@ gated with un@@ treated se@@ wage , the vibrio chol@@ era@@ e bacterium sett@@ les in the small inte@@ stine after it is in@@ gest@@ ed , causing severe diarrhea and de@@ hydra@@ tion .
those who are fortunate enough never to have witnessed cholera ’ s effects fir@@ sth@@ and might assume that it is just another stomach bug .
but without swi@@ ft medical attention , cholera can sa@@ p the life out of an adult or child in a matter of hours .
each year , cholera claims the lives of an estimated 9@@ 5,000 people ; many who die are children .
this year , images of li@@ st@@ less , glas@@ sy@@ -@@ eyed cholera victims a@@ waiting treatment have emerged in countries worldwide .
the disease has spread at an unprecedented rate in yemen , where more than 2,000 people have died since april .
cholera out@@ breaks are ongoing in somalia , south sudan , haiti , and other countries across sub-saharan africa and asia .
but the sad@@ dest fact about cholera ’ s recent toll on human lives is that every single death was preventable .
the world already has the knowledge and tools to control cholera effectively , but existing resources are not being alig@@ ned with the necessary global commit@@ ments .
that is why the new global strategy developed by the global task force on cholera control , a diverse network of technical partners , is so vital .
ending cholera – a global road@@ map to 2030 emphasi@@ zes a shift to pro@@ active approaches , and aims to reduce cholera deaths by 90 % over the next decade .
with full imple@@ mentation , the plan could also help as many as 20 countries eliminate disease transmission in the same ti@@ me@@ frame .
based on three pillars – early detection , integrated prevention tactics , and coordination between countries and partners – the road@@ map provides a concrete path for ending cholera as a public health threat .
once cholera gri@@ ps a community , it becomes increasingly difficult to control .
it is important , therefore , that the disease is not forgotten even when it is not cla@@ iming victims .
a multi-@@ sector approach that includes investments in water , sanitation , and hygiene – so-called wash services – can keep cholera at bay .
so can the pro@@ active use of oral cholera vaccines and quick access to treatments , such as oral re@@ hydra@@ tion solution and intra@@ ven@@ ous fluids .
improving wash infrastructure is the most effective path to prevention , though imple@@ menting these services will take time in countries with fewer resources .
for this reason , the road@@ map also encoura@@ ges the pre@@ emp@@ tive and large-scale deplo@@ yment of oral vaccines in cholera hot@@ spots .
the vaccines work immediately , and can prevent cholera for up to three years , serving as a bridge to the imple@@ mentation of lon@@ ger-@@ term solutions .
oral cholera vaccines are available via a global stock@@ pile main@@ tained by the world health organization , with support from ga@@ vi , the vaccine alliance .
more than 15 million doses have been distributed to 18 countries since the program ’ s creation in 2013 .
next year , the stock@@ pile is set to increase to more than 25 million doses , up from two million when it began .
ending cholera as a health threat by 2030 , as global partners and the who recently ple@@ dged , will require sustained collaboration and commitment from chol@@ er@@ a-@@ affected countries , technical partners , and international donors .
the goal may seem daunting , given that millions of people around the world are at risk of contra@@ cting the disease each year .
but with urbanization , climate change , and other factors likely to increase the threat of infection , it is a goal that must be met .
the road@@ map makes this possible .
imple@@ menting the plan will prove to be a cost-@@ effective solution for countries sa@@ ddled with responding to frequent cholera out@@ breaks .
that is one reason why action is ur@@ gently needed .
but embracing the strategy is also the right thing to do for the international community .
governments have a moral obligation to ensure that no one suc@@ cum@@ bs to a preventable death .
it is an obligation the who shares , and it is why we will work hard to help the world meet the ambitious targets we have set .
we have the tools needed to beat cholera .
now , with a plan in place , there can no longer be any excuse not to put them to use .
a tipping point missed
washington , dc – before america and the world settle in firmly to the new don@@ ald trum@@ p-@@ based reality , let ’ s take a little trip down the road not taken .
suppose we had wo@@ ken up last wednesday morning to a presi@@ dent@@ -@@ ele@@ ct hillary clinton .
and let ’ s say that , instead of former portu@@ gu@@ ese prime minister ant@@ ó@@ ni@@ o gu@@ terr@@ es , new zealand ’ s helen clark or bulg@@ aria ’ s kri@@ stal@@ ina geor@@ gi@@ eva had been picked to succeed ban ki@@ -@@ moon as united nations secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general .
clinton would have joined the united kingdom ’ s ther@@ esa may and german chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a mer@@ kel , helping achieve critical mass in the g@@ 7 .
and a female un secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general would have placed women at the helm of two of the world ’ s three biggest international organizations ( france ’ s christ@@ ine la@@ gar@@ de already runs the international mon@@ etary fund ) .
with so many female leaders , we would have begun to answer the question : what happens when women run the world ?
would the world be better for women ?
would it even be different ?
according to soci@@ ologists , female leaders are of two schools : queen bees , who are less likely to help other women advance , and righ@@ te@@ ous women , who make the advan@@ cement of other women a priority .
most early pione@@ ers , such as the uk ’ s margaret th@@ at@@ cher , india ’ s indi@@ ra gandhi , and israel ’ s gol@@ da mei@@ r , were queen bees ; all of them es@@ che@@ wed femin@@ ism .
more recently , righ@@ te@@ ous women have prevail@@ ed .
leaders like argentina ’ s cri@@ stina kir@@ ch@@ ner , brazil ’ s dil@@ ma r@@ ous@@ se@@ ff , and iceland ’ s j@@ ó@@ hanna sig@@ ur@@ ð@@ ar@@ d@@ ó@@ tti@@ r have all sought , in one way or another , to empower women and help them advance in their countries .
mer@@ kel and may have ten@@ ded to be more like queen bees , while clinton , la@@ gar@@ de , clark , and geor@@ gi@@ eva are more like righ@@ te@@ ous women .
seeking to advance other women can highlight her own wom@@ an@@ hood and thereby wea@@ ken her .
clinton , for example , was the third woman us secretary of state but the first who felt secure enough to be able to champion the cause of women and girls worldwide .
as president , she ple@@ dged , half her cabinet would be women , and she would further the state department initi@@ atives launched during her ten@@ ure .
yes , she also would have been careful to avoid being defined as a woman president . still , just the presence of a plur@@ ality of women has an impact .
consider a woman ’ s perspective on conflict . evidence does not support the stereot@@ ype that women are more paci@@ f@@ ist than men – the peace@@ makers and sett@@ lers of male dispu@@ tes .
women can be amaz@@ ons ; recall th@@ at@@ cher ’ s pro@@ secu@@ tion of the fal@@ kl@@ ands war and her ad@@ mon@@ i@@ tion to george h@@ .@@ w. bush not to “ go wo@@ b@@ bly ” in the run@@ -up to the first gulf war .
on the other hand , when men see wars , they naturally imagine the world of the warriors , whereas women see themselves in the women who must try to shelter their families from forces they cannot control .
that is precisely the diversity of perspective that is vital to decision-making .
and indeed , the institute for inclusive security at harvard ’ s kennedy school has tracked the differences women make as part of peace negotiations .
an acute awareness of the magnitude of civilian suffering in conflicts such as the sy@@ rian civil war or the ongoing hor@@ rors in the congo basin , and an appreciation of how cycles of violence perpetu@@ ate themselves over generations , can actually make women much more likely to urge the use of force in interventions .
former us secretary of state ma@@ del@@ eine al@@ bright famously chi@@ ded co@@ lin po@@ well for his rel@@ uc@@ tance to involve the us military in the bal@@ kans in the 1990s , in part because of her own family ’ s experience as c@@ ze@@ ch refugees from communism .
overall , a woman leader ’ s decisions are no more predictable than a male leader ’ s .
women are not mon@@ olith@@ ic : they have various ideological backgrounds and diverse gover@@ ning styles .
but when the world finally reaches the point when women are not a rar@@ ity at the tables of power , when their numbers reach a tipping point , their voices will be heard differently , and their opinions will hold more weight with the men around them .
women came closer in 20@@ 16 than in any other era to reaching that tipping point .
but we may still have to wait decades to find out what will happen when we finally do .
ma@@ dri@@ d – world order – or the lack there@@ of – is a hot topic these days .
our fix@@ ation with the future of global structures and systems is evident everywhere – in the news and at conferences , on best@@ seller lists , even in popular television shows .
people are anxious .
the world seems to be under@@ going fundamental change : new actors are emerging on the world stage , previously sac@@ ro@@ san@@ ct rules of international behavior are being open@@ ly de@@ fied , and a new wave of technological progress is disrup@@ ting entire industries and economic sectors .
in our quest for structure and predic@@ tability – a natural impulse in times of rapid change – we are desperate for hin@@ ts about how the world , and our role in it , will develop .
it is of course vital in such situations that we identify the best , or at least the most feasi@@ ble , way forward ; predic@@ tability provides a foundation for cost-@@ benefit analysis and strategic thinking .
the problem arises when our year@@ ning for certainty overwhel@@ ms rational thinking , taking our ideas and actions in an un@@ productive – or even dangerous – direction .
faced with political , economic , geo@@ strategic , and social uncertainty , policymakers have increasingly suc@@ cum@@ bed to the all@@ ure of nostal@@ gia , promising a return to what they portra@@ y as the familiar and complete rules and practices of the past .
in russia , president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin has been operating according to a n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ century worldview , in which great powers dominate their spheres of influence un@@ challenged .
as he not@@ ed at last october ’ s meeting of the val@@ dai discussion club , “ the bear will not even bother to ask permission .
here , we consider it the master of the ta@@ iga . ”
the islamic state is attemp@@ ting to return to an even more distant past .
its ad@@ her@@ ents es@@ po@@ use a medieval nin@@ th-century doctrine to justify their effort to re@@ establish the cali@@ p@@ hate , in which “ the leg@@ ality of all e@@ mir@@ ates , groups , states , and organizations becomes null ” and summary execution and slavery are mand@@ atory .
the west , too , has fallen into the trap of nostal@@ gia , cl@@ inging to a lat@@ e-@@ twen@@ ti@@ eth@@ -@@ century conception of order in which it makes the rules and can choose whether to follow them .
the latest example of this an@@ ach@@ r@@ oni@@ stic perspective is america ’ s ham@@ -@@ fi@@ sted ( not to mention failed ) attempt to stem support for the chin@@ a-@@ led asian infrastructure investment bank , after repeatedly ref@@ using to provide a greater voice for the world ’ s emerging powers in the brett@@ on woods institutions .
nostal@@ gia has also emerged as a major factor in many countries ’ domestic affairs .
throughout europe , popu@@ list parties – from the right-@@ wing united kingdom independence party to the far-@@ left sy@@ ri@@ za in greece – seek a return to the o@@ sten@@ si@@ bly simpler and happier times of national control and closed borders . in the us , a promin@@ ent strain of jur@@ is@@ p@@ ru@@ dence def@@ ends the “ original intent ” of the constitution ’ s fra@@ mers , while republicans are shifting toward isol@@ ation@@ ism and democrats are den@@ oun@@ cing free-@@ trade agre@@ ements .
but nostal@@ gia offers no solutions – only a dream of escape .
looking backward gets us no closer to what we want ; on the contrary , it is a su@@ re@@ fire way to miss the challenges – and miss out on the opportunities – that lie before us .
trying to advance one ’ s interests based on the rules of the past is like trying to solve today ’ s cross@@ word puzzle using yesterday ’ s clues .
let ’ s face it : the hal@@ cy@@ on world to which many people are so eager to return – before , say , the european union or the united nations or even the nation-@@ state – never really existed .
as mar@@ cel prou@@ st not@@ ed : “ remem@@ br@@ ance of things past is not necessarily the remem@@ br@@ ance of things as they were . ”
the past is being ab@@ rid@@ ged and su@@ gar@@ co@@ ated in order to portra@@ y it as superior to the widespread tu@@ mul@@ t and misery of today .
over time , nostal@@ gia has come to have a benign con@@ notation .
but the word – a combination of the greek no@@ sto@@ s ( home@@ coming ) and al@@ gos ( pain ) – was coined to describe the disease of “ acute hom@@ esi@@ ck@@ ness . ”
perhaps it would be beneficial to return to that definition of nostal@@ gia , at least in its political manifestation , as something more ak@@ in to an illness : a condition that distor@@ ts reality and im@@ pe@@ des the formu@@ lation of effective solutions for real-world challenges .
no worldview rooted in the n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth century – much less in the ninth century – is adequate to the complexi@@ ties of today ’ s globalized world .
likewise , the rise of new powers and non-@@ state actors means that rule making ( and breaking ) can no longer be restricted to a small western club .
and the intensity of global competition means that european countries cannot hope to thrive independently of one another .
fli@@ m@@ sy ideas thrive in the absence of a viable alternative .
that is why a period of reflection on world order is so important .
but , rather than allowing ourselves to be swept up in the re@@ gressi@@ ve tide of nostal@@ gia , we need to engage one another in a construc@@ tive conversation about the challenges that we actually face and propose new ideas for addressing them .
how press freedom is won
ac@@ cr@@ a – every year on may 3 – world press freedom day – news producers and consumers pause to reflect on the state of global media .
this year , as journalists and government officials gather in ghana for the event ’ s 25@@ th obser@@ v@@ ance , attention will turn to the myri@@ ad pressures and challenges confron@@ ting the profession worldwide , and how official and state-@@ sponsored hosti@@ lity toward the press is threatening democracy .
signs of journ@@ alistic resilience are also emerging .
so , rather than focusing exclu@@ sively on the obstacles journalists around the world are facing , let ’ s mark may 3 by considering the many reasons for optimism .
for star@@ ters , while no media market is immune to erosion of press freedom , resistance is possible .
recent events in europe are illu@@ stra@@ tive .
in slo@@ v@@ ak@@ ia , public ou@@ trage over the politically motivated double murder of an investig@@ ative journalist , j@@ án ku@@ ci@@ ak , and his fi@@ an@@ c@@ é@@ e , mar@@ tin@@ a ku@@ š@@ n@@ í@@ ro@@ v@@ á , forced prime minister robert fic@@ o to res@@ ign , and has his success@@ or , peter pel@@ le@@ gr@@ ini , walking a publi@@ c-@@ relations ti@@ gh@@ tro@@ pe .
hung@@ ary , too , has experienced its own , alb@@ eit tam@@ er , version of journ@@ alistic pus@@ h@@ back .
according to a recent study by the european journalism center , despite dee@@ pen@@ ing government control over how the media operates , investig@@ ative reporting remains active , and “ ab@@ uses of the taxpa@@ yers ’ money are regularly exposed . ”
to be sure , the media are under attack like never before , and not only from fake news and polari@@ zing presidents .
the sla@@ ying of nine journalists in kabul on april 30 , in back@@ -to-@@ back suicide bomb@@ ings that killed at least 25 people , marked the dead@@ liest day for journalists in afghanistan since the fall of the taliban , and added to a grim global tally .
according to reporters without borders , more than 1,000 journalists have been murdered around the world in the last 15 years , and only a handful of the perpetr@@ ators have been brought to justice .
and yet fresh gli@@ mmers of hope are multi@@ plying .
around the world , journalists and their suppor@@ ters are fighting back in encouraging ways .
while governments from china to russia routinely block or filter access to the internet , half of the world ’ s population is now connected – a 20 % increase in only five years .
in sudan , journalists are using this connectivity to save lives .
last year , when the government refused to inform the public about a devastating cholera outbreak , journalists with radio dab@@ anga , working with doctors and nurses , used the what@@ sa@@ pp messaging service to share information about prevention and treatment .
even in a violent and divided country like somalia , the internet is being used for good ; increased streaming speeds have kept members of the country ’ s si@@ zable diaspora connected with friends and family , and have enabled meaningful dialogue across communities .
legal norms are also moving in the right direction .
between 2011 and 20@@ 16 , the number of countries with freedom of information laws increased from 90 to 1@@ 12 .
this commitment was dee@@ pen@@ ed last month when the european union adopted a new law to protect whist@@ le-@@ blo@@ wers from pro@@ secu@@ tion .
in a statement , authorities said they hoped the measure would be a bo@@ on to investig@@ ative journalists by protecting sources who report viol@@ ations of european law .
where fewer legal prote@@ ctions are in place , journalists are becoming more creative .
in the philippines , where independent news organizations have become targets of s@@ lan@@ der by politicians and online tro@@ ll@@ s , reporters are turning the tables with devastating effect .
for example , in a recent series of reports identi@@ fying people making threats against the media , the news website rap@@ pler un@@ covered a network of tro@@ ll@@ s tied directly to government insi@@ ders .
finally , journalists are working to improve the diversity of their own industry .
in the democratic republic of congo , for example , one media organization created a database with the contact details of thousands of female experts who are available for media commentary and analysis .
this simple exercise has led to a dramatic increase in the percentage of female experts appearing in the press .
these are just a few of the bright spots we should be high@@ lighting during this year ’ s obser@@ v@@ ance of world press freedom day .
every day , courageous men and women ( and sometimes even children ) around the world continue to brave the odds to bring us the news .
we all benefit from their dedic@@ ation , and we all have an obligation to honor their successes , not just their sacrifi@@ ces .
worlds apart
macro@@ economic policies , financial globalization , and changes in labor market institutions have exac@@ erb@@ ated inequality in recent decades , not only in income and wealth , but also in access to education , healthcare , social protection , as well as in political participation and influence .
even within countries experiencing rapid economic growth , an array of factors , exac@@ erb@@ ated by tremendous demographic changes , has conspi@@ red to transmit inequality of knowledge , social responsibility , and life chances from one generation to the next .
as surve@@ yed in the united nations report the inequality predi@@ cam@@ ent , few countries , rich or poor , have proved immune to the global trend of rising inequality , or to its consequences for education , health , and social welfare .
of course , there is no simple cau@@ sal relationship linking poverty and inequality to violence .
but inequality and a sense of deprivation do contribute to res@@ ent@@ ment and social inst@@ ability , threatening security .
exclu@@ ded and facing b@@ leak life pro@@ spe@@ cts , young people , in particular , often experience anom@@ ie and may turn to anti-@@ social behavior , including violence .
nor is there a simple explanation of what causes poverty .
clearly , however , poverty arises from various complex conditions , and its am@@ eli@@ or@@ ation requires a multi@@ dimensional approach .
it is hard to imagine , for example , how to “ make poverty history ” without also generating enough decent work , educational opportunities , and healthcare for all .
to be sure , the world has seen progress on some fron@@ ts in recent decades .
access to education for girls has improved , and some gender gaps have been reduced .
despite aids and the resur@@ gence of malaria and tuberculosis , life expectancy has increased in much of the world due to improved public health systems .
overall , however , the inequality gaps are large and , in many cases , growing .
the most important determin@@ ant of income inequality today is wealth inequality , with the increasing concentration of asset ownership in recent years princi@@ p@@ ally responsible for greater income inequality in most countries .
meanwhile , growing unemployment , wi@@ dening skill and productivity gaps , and the “ inform@@ alization ” or “ casu@@ alization ” of labor markets have exac@@ erb@@ ated income ine@@ qualities worldwide , as the number of “ working poor ” and the inci@@ dence of “ job@@ less growth ” has spread .
nor have stabili@@ zation and structural adju@@ st@@ ment programs , imposed since the 1980 ’ s , delivered on their promise of achieving higher economic growth .
growth in much of the world during the past quar@@ ter-@@ century has been slower than in the previous 25 years , despite more rapid growth in east asia , india , and a few other countries .
such growth differences suggest that overall global inequality may not have increased un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally .
but ine@@ qualities at the national level have dee@@ pen@@ ed in most countries in recent years , largely due to economic liber@@ alization at both the national and international levels .
indeed , in much of the world , such economic reforms have actually under@@ min@@ ed growth rates as well as the progressive role of government , while otherwise increasing overall ine@@ qualities .
the few exceptions have been due largely to continued or new progressive government interventions .
but they are exceptions : the cumulative impact of these reforms over the past 25 years has been greater inequality in most developed and developing countries , with rising unemployment , greater ear@@ nings dispar@@ ities , reduced social protection , and environmental degradation .
international financial liber@@ alization , for example , has under@@ min@@ ed the use of more inclusive and targeted developmental credit to promote des@@ ired economic activities .
in addition , contrary to the promises of its pro@@ pon@@ ents , financial liber@@ alization has actually resulted in net capital flows from the capit@@ al-@@ poor to the capit@@ al-@@ rich over the long term , while increasing financial vola@@ tili@@ ty and weak@@ ening economic activity .
meanwhile , free-@@ trade negotiations seem to ignore historical trends .
developing countries ’ international terms of trade have wor@@ sen@@ ed : prices of primary commodities have declined in relation to manufac@@ tures , as have tropical agriculture prices against temper@@ ate agriculture , and prices of generic manufac@@ tures have fallen relative to output protected by intellectual property rights .
as a result , trade liber@@ alization of manufac@@ tures has resulted in de-@@ industri@@ alization and greater unemployment in much of the world , as in the case of gar@@ ments this year .
and , while agricultural trade liber@@ alization may enhance export ear@@ nings for some poor countries , the main bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ aries will be the more well-@@ to-@@ do agricultural expor@@ ters .
countries that import currently subsidi@@ zed food will be worse off .
the “ retreat of the state ” in much of the developing world in recent decades has involved a generally reduced role for government , including the capacity to lead and sustain development , as well as its progressive social interventions in areas such as public education , health , housing , and utili@@ ties .
the economic liber@@ alization carried out in much of the world in the last 25 years was a fla@@ wed policy from the start , and its consequences have become gl@@ ar@@ ingly obvious .
unless the world re@@ focuses economic policies to address the ad@@ verse impact of economic inequality on growth and poverty reduction , the poor and the privileged will continue to live worlds apart .
whi@@ ther the multi@@ lat@@ eral trading system ?
brus@@ sels – free trade seems to have few suppor@@ ters these days .
though actual trade volumes are reco@@ vering from the post-@@ crisis recession and drop in commodity prices , “ globalization ” has become increasingly con@@ ten@@ tious , as exem@@ pli@@ fied by the election of us president don@@ ald trum@@ p on the back of a promise to rip up international agre@@ ements and get tough on trade partners .
what does this mean for the future of the rul@@ es-@@ based trading system ?
some 60 years ago , when the current rul@@ es-@@ based global trading system was conceived , the united states was the world ’ s sole economic “ hyper@@ power , ” poss@@ essing un@@ questioned dominance in the day ’ s most advanced manufacturing industries .
with enough power to impose rules , and enough dominance to be able to count on acc@@ ru@@ ing the largest share of the benefits , it could – and did – perform the role of “ ben@@ evol@@ ent he@@ gem@@ on . ”
as japan and europe recovered from world war ii – with the lat@@ ter getting an added boost from economic integration – america ’ s lead began to d@@ wind@@ le , and by the 1970s and 1980s , the us was sharing power over the world ’ s trade agenda with europe .
nonetheless , because the us and europe share so many common interests , they generally ad@@ her@@ ed to a cooperative approach .
it was not until impor@@ ts began to overwhel@@ m a growing number of industries in the us , fu@@ eling the emergence of large and persistent external defic@@ its , that the country ’ s trade policy became more defen@@ sive , creating friction with many of its partners .
yet , even then , us leaders understood the value of the liberal multi@@ lat@@ eral trading system , and supported the establishment , in 1995 , of the world trade organization as the success@@ or to the general agreement on tari@@ ffs and trade .
the w@@ to ’ s creation amo@@ unted to a major step forward , as it addressed not just tari@@ ffs , but also other trade barriers , including indi@@ rect barriers ar@@ is@@ ing from domestic regulations .
given the complexity of ass@@ essing how domestic regulations might im@@ pe@@ de trade , especially compared to jud@@ ging whether a tari@@ ff has been correctly applied , the w@@ to needed effective dispu@@ te-@@ settlement mechanisms , with members agre@@ eing to bin@@ ding arbit@@ ration .
the system worked , because its major members recognized the legiti@@ macy of independent panels , even if they sometimes deliver politically inconvenient judgments .
yet this recognition is now increasingly in doubt .
consider what type of economy would support a rul@@ es-@@ based system .
after w@@ wi@@ i , the us supported such a system , because of its un@@ as@@ sail@@ able economic supre@@ macy .
an open rul@@ es-@@ based system would also be highly appealing in a world com@@ prising only small countries , none of which could hope to gain by rel@@ ying on its relative economic power .
things become more complicated when the global economy includes a small number of economies of similar size , larger than the small economies from the previous example , but not large enough to dominate the system alone .
that is the scenario the nobel laure@@ ate economist paul kru@@ gman considered in a 1989 paper on bil@@ ater@@ alism , in which he reported that a world consi@@ sting of three major trading blo@@ cs constit@@ utes the worst con@@ stell@@ ation for trade , as a lack of explicit cooperation among all three would lead to increasing trade barriers .
unfortunately , this is exactly the situation in which the global economy finds itself today .
there are three dominant economies or trading blo@@ cs – china , the european union , and the us – with very similar trade volumes ( exports plus impor@@ ts ) of around $ 4 trillion each .
( japan , which was a strong con@@ tender 25 years ago , now has a much smaller trade volume . )
together , the g@@ 3 economies account for 40 % of world trade and 45 % of global gdp .
with economic power distributed in this way , explicit cooperation by all three actors is crucial .
yet there are compelling reasons why they would be re@@ tic@@ ent to pursue such cooperation .
even if trum@@ p weren ’ t president , the current global trading system would present problems for the us , whose trade policy has long focused on manufactured goods .
( trade in raw materials has always been relatively free , and trade in agricultural goods has usually been considered special , and thus not subject to rules like the “ most favor@@ ed nation ” principle , which applies to manufac@@ tures . )
because the us is now self-@@ sufficient in energy , it needs to export fewer manufactured goods than industrialized countries with no domestic energy resources .
annual us exports of manufactured goods thus now amount to only about $ 1 trillion annu@@ ally – significantly less than both the eu and china , which export almost twice as much in manufactured goods , despite having somewhat smaller economies .
to be sure , trum@@ p is unlikely to start an ou@@ tri@@ ght trade war , because any us tari@@ ff would harm the interests of the country ’ s largest companies , which have invested huge sums in production facilities abroad .
yet no individual firm will be willing to give up much of its political capital to defend the rul@@ es-@@ based system , either , because it would have to bear the losses , while its competitors shared the gains .
the same goes for the g@@ 3 trading blo@@ cs : if the eu expen@@ ds political capital to stop the us from under@@ mining w@@ to mechanisms , china ( and the rest of world ) will re@@ ap most of the gains .
that dynamic goes some way toward explaining why china ’ s leaders , despite having pro@@ cla@@ imed their support for the multi@@ lat@@ eral rul@@ es-@@ based trading system , haven ’ t taken concrete action to rein@@ force it .
their re@@ tic@@ ence is probably intensi@@ fied by the assumption that , within the current generation , their country will dominate the global economy ; at that point , they might no longer want to be bound by somebody else ’ s rules .
it does not help matters that the communist party of china has recently been empowered even further in all areas of the economy , with all major firms now having to accept a c@@ pc representative on their board .
it is difficult to see how a dominant economic power governed by a single party – especially one with such extensive control over the economy – would accept the pri@@ macy of international rules and procedures over domestic consider@@ ations .
the conclusion is clear .
the world should prepare itself for the erosion of the rul@@ es-@@ based trading system ens@@ hr@@ ined in the w@@ to .
wrong@@ headed in rio
copenhagen – tens of thousands of people will soon gather in rio de jan@@ ei@@ ro for the united nations earth summit .
the participants , ranging from we@@ ary politicians to enthusiastic campaig@@ ners , are supposed to rei@@ gni@@ te global concern for the environment .
unfortunately , the summit is likely to be a wasted opportunity .
the un is show@@ cas@@ ing the all@@ uring promise of a “ green economy , ” focused on tackling global warming .
in fact , the summit is striking at the wrong target , negle@@ cting the much greater environmental concerns of the vast majority of the world .
global warming is by no means our main environmental threat .
even if we assumed – un@@ reasonably – that it caused all deaths from floods , dr@@ ou@@ ghts , heat waves , and storms , this total would amount to just 0.@@ 0@@ 6 % of all deaths in developing countries .
in comparison , 13 % of all third world deaths result from water and air pollution .
so , for each person who might die from global warming , about 2@@ 10 people die from health problems that result from a lack of clean water and sanitation , from breathing smoke generated by burning dirty fuels ( such as dried animal dung ) indoors , and from breathing polluted air out@@ doors .
by focusing on measures to prevent global warming , the advanced countries might help to prevent many people from dying .
that sounds good until you realize that it means that 2@@ 10 times as many people in poorer countries might die need@@ lessly as a result – because the resources that could have saved them were spent on wind@@ mills , solar panels , biofuels , and other rich@@ -@@ world fix@@ ations .
but of course , poor countries ’ tangible pollution problems are not tren@@ dy , and they do not engage outs@@ po@@ ken campaig@@ ners , media , and governments the way that global warming can .
nowhere are the failed priorities better illu@@ strated than in the un ’ s official , colorful “ rio + 20 ” le@@ af@@ let .
here , the un hel@@ pf@@ ully provides a lay@@ man ’ s explanation of the summit , along with examples of its en@@ visi@@ oned “ green economy ” in action .
we see scary pictures of dry river@@ beds ( the result of global warming ) , along with plenty of pretty solutions like wind turbin@@ es and solar panels .
the problem is that green energy mostly is still much more expensive , less effective , and more inter@@ mitt@@ ent than the alternatives .
yet , the summit literature claims that it will boost economic growth and eradicate poverty .
but seriously , why do well-@@ meaning first worl@@ ders think that the third world should have energy technologies that are more expensive , fe@@ e@@ bler , and less reliable than their own ?
without a hint of irony , the le@@ af@@ let is called “ the future we want . ” but , in a world where a billion people go to bed hungry , and where six million die each year from air and water pollution , most of those in the developing world likely have a very different set of priorities for their future .
the le@@ af@@ let che@@ er@@ fully claims that china ’ s shift “ to a low-@@ carbon growth strategy based on the development of renewable energy sources &#91; has &#93; created jobs , income , and revenue . ”
in fact , over the past 25 years , china has quad@@ ru@@ pled its co2 emissions .
while china does produce about half of the world ’ s solar panels , 98 % are expor@@ ted to re@@ ap generous subsidies from rich@@ -@@ world markets .
only 0.@@ 00@@ 5 % of china ’ s energy comes from solar panels .
china ’ s dec@@ ad@@ es-@@ long economic expansion has lifted 600 million people out of poverty , but the enormous pollution that this has ent@@ a@@ iled does not fit into rio + 20 ’ s green narrative .
likewise , the bro@@ ch@@ ure explains that some farmers in uganda have embraced organic farming .
unfortunately , africa is almost entirely organic now – leading to low yields , hunger , and deforestation .
africa needs to boost its yields , and that means enabling farmers to use modern crops , fertilizers , and pesticides .
producing less with more effort might appeal to well-@@ fed first worl@@ ders , but it is literally star@@ ving the poor .
reading further , the le@@ af@@ let gus@@ hes that france has created 9@@ 0,000 jobs in the green economy . but the stark reality remains hidden : the average cost of each green job is more than $ 200,000 per year , which french taxpa@@ yers pat@@ ently cannot afford .
and economic models show that france has lost as many or more jobs because of the extra costs of the subsidies .
adding insu@@ lt to injury , a beautiful photograph shows electric cars finishing the “ zero emissions race ” in gen@@ eva . om@@ it@@ ted is the fact that most electricity still comes from burning fossil fuels , so the cars are anything but “ zero ” emissions .
and , more importantly , most of our planet ’ s inhabit@@ ants still dream of ow@@ ning some form of mechan@@ ized transport – which is unlikely to be an electric vehicle with a price tag of $ 50,000 or more .
in a world pla@@ gu@@ ed by serious problems caused by air and water pollution , this bre@@ e@@ zy focus on tren@@ dy topics and un@@ realistic solutions is deeply disturbing .
a disconnected global elite is flying to rio to tell the world ’ s poor to have a solar panel .
rather than p@@ ander@@ ing to advanced countries ’ obs@@ essions , rio + 20 could do more good for humanity – and the planet – by focusing on the top environmental problems and their simple solutions .
the w@@ to re@@ born ?
new delhi – for too long , the world trade organization has langu@@ ished , to lift a reference from t.@@ s. eli@@ ot , by the “ waters of le@@ man ” ( lake gen@@ eva ) .
once the world ’ s pre@@ em@@ in@@ ent multi@@ lat@@ eral trade forum , the w@@ to has been ste@@ adily margin@@ alized in recent years , and recent re@@ bu@@ kes of globalization , such as the united kingdom ’ s bre@@ x@@ it vote and the election of don@@ ald trum@@ p as us president , suggest that this trend will accelerate .
but these outcomes may actually have the opposite effect , o@@ wing to three key developments that could enable the revi@@ val of the w@@ to – and of the multi@@ lat@@ er@@ alism that it em@@ bodies .
the first development is the decline of alternative trade arrangements .
the w@@ to reached its peak in the early 200@@ 0s , a few years after the uruguay round of global trade negotiations concluded , and a time when more countries – most not@@ ably china – were ac@@ ce@@ ding to the organization .
but major trade players like the united states and the european union subsequently shifted their focus from multi@@ lat@@ eral trade agre@@ ements to bil@@ ateral , regional , and mega-@@ regional deals .
the mega-@@ region@@ als – namely , the trans@@ -@@ pacific partnership ( t@@ pp ) and the trans@@ atlantic trade and investment partnership ( t@@ tip ) – posed a particularly grave threat to the w@@ to .
yet those are precisely the deals that the trum@@ p administration is reje@@ cting , or at least post@@ po@@ ning .
european integration had a similar impact on the w@@ to , as it provided an alternative platform for managing intra@@ -@@ european trade .
but the european project has fallen on hard times , the most sali@@ ent sign being the uk ’ s im@@ pen@@ ding de@@ par@@ ture from the eu .
after bre@@ x@@ it , the w@@ to will probably become an important forum for britain ’ s trade relations with the world .
any further dis@@ integration of the eu will only bol@@ ster that trend .
of course , it is possible that regional trade agre@@ ements in asia and elsewhere will continue to flourish .
but new leadership would have to emerge .
and no single syste@@ mi@@ cally important country today meets the rigorous requirements of such leadership : internal political stability , economic dynam@@ ism , relatively contained risk , and a ste@@ ad@@ fast commitment to open markets .
however counterintuitive that may sound , a second development that bo@@ des well for the w@@ to ’ s revi@@ val is voters ’ increasing reje@@ ction of hyper-@@ globalization .
it goes beyond creating open markets for goods and services to include increased immigration ( in the us and europe ) , harmon@@ izing regulations ( the ambition of the t@@ pp and the t@@ tip ) , and in@@ tru@@ sive adju@@ dic@@ ation of domestic policies ( the inve@@ stor@@ -@@ settlement procedures under na@@ ft@@ a and the t@@ pp ) .
in the eu ’ s case , it even ent@@ a@@ ils a common currency .
for such integration , region@@ alism is much more effective than the w@@ to .
now that “ deep ” is out , the w@@ to could once again become an attractive forum for trading countries to do business .
make no mistake : there will still be a lot of globalization for the w@@ to to facili@@ tate and manage , not least because of the inex@@ orable march of technology .
the mes@@ h-@@ like structure of trade and investment connecting countries , embodied in global valu@@ e-@@ chains – what a@@ adi@@ ty@@ a mat@@ too of the world bank and i have called “ cris@@ s-@@ crossing globalization ” – will prevent significant back@@ sli@@ ding .
the third development that could rein@@ vi@@ gor@@ ate the w@@ to is a more prote@@ c@@ tionist stance by the trum@@ p administration .
if the us raises tari@@ ffs or imple@@ ments a bor@@ der-@@ adju@@ st@@ ment tax favor@@ ing exports and pen@@ alizing impor@@ ts , its trade partners are likely to turn to the w@@ to for adju@@ dic@@ ation , given the organization ’ s demonstrated dispu@@ te-@@ settlement capability .
the w@@ to could , therefore , become the place where us trade policies are scru@@ tin@@ ized and kept in check .
the univers@@ ality of w@@ to mem@@ ber@@ ship , previously seen as an im@@ pedi@@ ment to countries eager to move ahead with new rules and agre@@ ements , could be its main strength , as it impli@@ es a high degree of legiti@@ macy , which is essential to minimize trade ten@@ sions and the risk of conflict .
in my book ec@@ lip@@ se , i argued that multi@@ lat@@ er@@ alism offered the best means for en@@ suring the peaceful rise of new powers .
but it seems that the same argument could apply equally well to the management of re@@ ce@@ ding powers .
but the w@@ to ’ s revi@@ val will not happen automatically .
willing stake@@ holders must actively pursue it .
the most obvious candidates for the job are the mid-@@ size economies that have been the greatest bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ ary of globalization , and that , unlike the us and some european countries , are not currently under pressure from a glob@@ ali@@ za@@ tion-@@ a@@ verse public .
the champi@@ ons of multi@@ lat@@ er@@ alism should include australia , brazil , india , indonesia , mexico , new zealand , south africa , the united kingdom , and possibly china and japan .
because none of them is large ( with the exception of china ) , they must work collectively to defend open markets .
moreover , they must open their own markets not only in the traditional areas of agriculture and manufacturing , but also in new areas such as services , investments , and standards .
in doing so , these countries would also be responding to the increasingly trans@@ ac@@ tional approach to sustaining openness that the larger tra@@ ders are being comp@@ elled to adopt .
the world needs a robust response to the decline of hyper-@@ globalization .
multi@@ lat@@ er@@ alism , champi@@ oned by mid-@@ size trading economies with a strong interest in preserving openness , may be it .
to the shor@@ es of le@@ man they must now head .
the lost lessons of world war i
paris – it has been 100 years since world war i ended , and the cent@@ en@@ ary was com@@ memor@@ ated this month with great po@@ mp in australia , canada , france , and the united kingdom .
germany sent high-@@ level authorities to france to mark the occasion , re@@ affir@@ ming the reconciliation between the two countries .
but the fact that fran@@ co-@@ german reconciliation did not occur until europe had suffered another devastating war demonstrates how fragile peace can be , especially when political leaders are as short@@ sighted as they often are .
the cambridge historian christopher clark ap@@ tly titled his 2012 book on the origins of ww@@ i the sle@@ ep@@ wal@@ kers .
through a combination of will@@ ful blindness , utter com@@ plac@@ ency , and intense stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness , europe ’ s leaders subje@@ cted their countries to a conflict that shat@@ tered an entire generation .
by the time ww@@ i erup@@ ted , it should have been clear that industri@@ alization and the transportation revolution had transformed warfare .
the cri@@ mean war of 18@@ 5@@ 3-@@ 18@@ 56 had over one million casu@@ alties ; the american civil war of 18@@ 6@@ 1-@@ 18@@ 65 resulted in over 60@@ 0,000 deaths .
despite these experiences , europe ’ s leaders c@@ lung to the n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ century military theor@@ ist carl von c@@ lau@@ se@@ witz ’ s dic@@ tum that , “ war is the continu@@ ation of politics through other means . ” so politics continued in the form of war , resul@@ ting in 20 million military and civilian casu@@ alties .
yet not even that was enough to wake up the sle@@ ep@@ wal@@ kers .
in the years following the ar@@ mi@@ sti@@ ce , europe ’ s leaders failed to transcend the di@@ visions that ww@@ i had laid bare , with the ten@@ sions between the french and ger@@ mans being particularly dest@@ abili@@ zing .
this failure was reflected in the ar@@ mi@@ sti@@ ce itself , which imposed exc@@ essi@@ vely harsh requirements on germany , including billions of dollars in repar@@ ations payments , due at a time when the country faced a deep economic crisis .
meanwhile , international over@@ sight was too weak , with the league of nations remaining largely silent in the face of dangerous developments , such as ad@@ ol@@ f hitler ’ s re@@ milit@@ ari@@ zation of the rhin@@ eland .
the us senate ’ s reje@@ ction of the league of nations in 19@@ 19 – and thus of the principles of internation@@ alism and multi@@ lat@@ er@@ alism that president woo@@ dro@@ w wilson had promot@@ ed – certainly didn ’ t help matters .
more fundamentally , w@@ wi@@ i erup@@ ted because nation@@ alism was allowed to continue to fester .
french prime minister geor@@ ges cle@@ men@@ ce@@ au , for one , remained deeply nation@@ alistic and , in particular , ve@@ he@@ ment@@ ly anti-@@ german .
but while behaving like cle@@ men@@ ce@@ au might win the war ( especially if a power like the united states shows up to offer crucial help ) , it cannot win the peace ; hard nation@@ alism naturally leads to conflict .
yet , today , a major world leader , us president don@@ ald trum@@ p , is behaving very much like cle@@ men@@ ce@@ au .
this holds serious implications not just for the us , but also for europe .
to be sure , french president emmanuel ma@@ cr@@ on embra@@ ces the “ wil@@ son@@ ian principles ” that trum@@ p reje@@ cts .
but , as the inter@@ war period star@@ k@@ ly showed , if core rules and principles are not accepted by all , the institutions they under@@ pin cannot be sustained .
w@@ wi@@ i accomplished what even ww@@ i could not : it ended the era of european global dominance .
while europe has grown and prosper@@ ed since 1945 , it has not re@@ gained the global leadership status its major countries once poss@@ essed .
this leaves today ’ s european union at the mer@@ cy of a us that has rejected multi@@ lat@@ er@@ alism and embraced nation@@ alism .
of course , plenty of the risks europe faces lie within its own borders .
in france , for example , many are brus@@ hing off the warn@@ ings issued by ma@@ cr@@ on – or , more con@@ cre@@ tely , by their history books – as they push back against their president ’ s efforts to take up the man@@ tle of multi@@ lat@@ er@@ alism .
the risk today is that generations that have not known war will reproduce the chain of events that lead to it .
this risk is exem@@ pli@@ fied by the recent “ yellow v@@ est ” prote@@ sts in france against an environmental tax on fuel .
the prote@@ sts were also intended to be a broader re@@ bu@@ ke of ma@@ cr@@ on , whom many blame for their declining spending power .
the prote@@ sters probably think that they are acting in the spirit of the 17@@ 89 french revolution , a spirit that the french perio@@ di@@ cally revi@@ ve in their country ’ s politics .
but they are actually re@@ en@@ acting the 1930s , with its right-@@ wing protest movements and mili@@ ti@@ as .
this is not to say that french citizens – and , in particular , young people – have nothing about which to complain .
unemployment has remained too high for too long , and while france has largely escaped the spike in income inequality seen in other countries , such as the us , systemic ine@@ qualities are pervasive .
but the fact is that the emotional reje@@ ction of any person or institution even remotely associated with established “ elites ” – including mainstream political parties and trade uni@@ ons – l@@ ends itself to exploitation by popu@@ list de@@ ma@@ go@@ gues .
and history could not be clear@@ er about the risks generated when such de@@ ma@@ go@@ gues secure power .
the world has changed profoundly over the last century .
our economies are more deeply inter@@ twin@@ ed than ever before , and the sheer scale of destruction that could be wr@@ ought by today ’ s weapon@@ ry may invite some se@@ m@@ blan@@ ce of restra@@ int .
but , as trum@@ p ’ s er@@ ra@@ tic pres@@ iden@@ cy – including his challenges to long@@ standing alli@@ ances and reck@@ less nuclear post@@ uring – star@@ k@@ ly demonstrates , the structures we have created to preserve peace are far from fool@@ proof .
with populations across the west embracing nation@@ alistic and popu@@ list ideas , we are again dancing on the ri@@ m of a volcano .
pu@@ tin on parade
new york – this may ’ s parade in moscow to com@@ memor@@ ate the 70@@ th anniversary of the end of world war ii promises to be the greatest victory day celebration since the soviet union ’ s collapse .
some 16@@ ,000 soldiers , 200 ar@@ mor@@ ed vehicles , and 150 planes and helicop@@ ters are set to pass through and over red square .
it will be a scene that would easily have been familiar to soviet leaders like leon@@ id bre@@ z@@ hne@@ v and ni@@ kit@@ a k@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ che@@ v , taking the sal@@ ute at@@ op len@@ in ’ s tom@@ b .
yet , though russia ’ s w@@ wi@@ i allies were from europe and north america , no western leaders will attend the com@@ memor@@ ation – a reflection of the west ’ s dis@@ approval of pu@@ tin ’ s invasion of ukra@@ ine and an@@ nex@@ ation of cri@@ me@@ a .
instead , russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin ’ s high-@@ profile guests will include the leaders of china , india , and north korea , under@@ sc@@ oring just how few friends russia has these days .
the sur@@ real nature of this gathering reflects the increasingly bizarre nature of pu@@ tin ’ s regime .
indeed , watching russia nowadays is like watching the last inst@@ all@@ ment of the x-@@ men film franch@@ ise , “ days of future past . ”
just as the x-@@ men in that film join forces with their younger selves to save mankind ’ s future , today ’ s kre@@ m@@ lin is har@@ king back to russia ’ s soviet past in what it sees as a contemporary fight for the country ’ s survival .
critical to this strategy is propaganda con@@ fl@@ ating the west today with the ger@@ mans who invaded russia in 194@@ 1 , while painting ukra@@ ini@@ an government officials as “ fas@@ cists ” and “ neo-@@ nazis . ”
the kre@@ m@@ lin has reli@@ ed on such claims , together with the supposed need to defend russians abroad , to justify its aggression against ukra@@ ine .
in pu@@ tin ’ s speech following the an@@ nex@@ ation of cri@@ me@@ a , he charged that the west ’ s ref@@ us@@ al “ to engage in dialogue ” left russia with no choice . “ we are constantly proposing cooperation on all key issues , ” he declared .
a month later , pu@@ tin rein@@ forced this image of russians as the morally superior victims of a cruel and un@@ com@@ promising west . “ we are less pragmatic than other people , less calculating , ” he asser@@ ted , before adding that russia ’ s “ great@@ ness ” and “ vast size ” means “ we have a more generous heart . ”
it is not difficult to see the parall@@ els between pu@@ tin ’ s approach and that of joseph stalin , who declared at the start of w@@ wi@@ i that the “ enemy ” aims to “ destroy ” russia ’ s “ national culture , ” to “ ger@@ mani@@ ze ” its people , and “ convert them into slaves . ”
the difference , of course , is that the nazi wehr@@ macht actually invaded the soviet union , whereas ukra@@ ine simply wanted to decide its own future .
without defending stalin , one must recognize the immense soviet contribution – including the lives of 26 million citizens – to the al@@ lied victory in w@@ wi@@ i .
at the time , the military parade in red square – fe@@ atur@@ ing almost 3@@ 5,000 troops , up to 1,@@ 900 pieces of military equipment , and a 1,@@ 40@@ 0-@@ man orchestra – was a well-@@ deser@@ ved pa@@ ge@@ ant .
the soviet leadership spar@@ ed no cost in st@@ aging its military displays , which , in the absence of an external military threat , became an important vehicle for r@@ all@@ ying national unity .
after the soviet union ’ s collapse , russia , no longer a superpower , put its military spectac@@ les on ice .
but in 2005 , to com@@ memor@@ ate the 60@@ th anniversary of the end of w@@ wi@@ i , pu@@ tin held a major parade – one that western leaders , believing that russia might have a european future , did attend .
the tone of this year ’ s victory day com@@ memor@@ ations is far less antici@@ pat@@ ory .
how can one celebrate the end of a war at a time when the descen@@ dan@@ ts of those who fought it ( und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly driven by the hope that future generations would live in peace ) are killing one another in a brutal little war in eastern ukra@@ ine ?
what is the point of gran@@ dio@@ se fire@@ works displays am@@ id the firing of real ho@@ witz@@ ers and rockets ?
the historian robert pa@@ x@@ ton believed that one could tell much about a country by its para@@ des .
his 1966 book para@@ des and politics at vi@@ chy describes how philippe p@@ é@@ tain , as chief of state of vi@@ chy france , used pa@@ ge@@ an@@ try , re@@ ac@@ tionary politics , and , of course , a partnership with ad@@ ol@@ f hitler to du@@ pe his defeated country into believing that it still ma@@ ttered in the world .
the vi@@ chy state ’ s brand of authoritarian tradition@@ alism li@@ oni@@ zed family and fa@@ therland , with p@@ é@@ tain , a former military commander , serving as a kind of military king , ex@@ al@@ ted on the tribun@@ e .
the parall@@ els with pu@@ tin ’ s russia are clear .
pu@@ tin views himself as a new c@@ z@@ ar .
his k@@ gb background dictat@@ es his leadership style , which includes the abo@@ li@@ tion of free and fair elections , the per@@ secu@@ tion of oppon@@ ents , and the promotion of conservative values that he , like p@@ é@@ tain before him , juxta@@ poses with the corrup@@ ting influence of an “ im@@ moral ” and “ dec@@ ad@@ ent ” west .
rel@@ ying on this approach , pu@@ tin has built alli@@ ances with the likes of syria ’ s president bas@@ har al-@@ as@@ sad and egypt ’ s military rul@@ er ab@@ del f@@ atta@@ h el-@@ sis@@ i .
china , the world ’ s second largest economy , is a useful addition to this collection of friendly anti-@@ democratic states , as it has its own strategic gri@@ ev@@ ances with the west .
unlike china , however , russia is not a rising superpower .
pu@@ tin may try to portra@@ y his actions in ukra@@ ine as a fight against fas@@ cism .
but it is really a fight for relevance – a fight he will never win .
no matter how grand the parade , he cannot hide the truth : russia ’ s days as a superpower are in the past .
pu@@ tin ’ s patrio@@ tism , like p@@ é@@ tain ’ s , is that of the van@@ qu@@ ished .
x@@ i ’ s strong hand against trum@@ p
london – the world will soon witness a historic test of will@@ s between china and the united states , two super@@ powers whose leaders see themselves as supreme .
in the immediate sense , it will be a battle over trade .
but also at stake is the strategic leadership of east asia and , eventually , the international order .
as things stand , china holds a stronger position than many people realize .
the question is whether chinese president x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping will feel confident or bra@@ zen enough to want to prove it .
the test of will@@ s was hardly china ’ s choice ; but nor does it come as a surprise .
us president don@@ ald trum@@ p ’ s recently announced import tari@@ ffs on steel , aluminum , and other chines@@ e-@@ made goods are in keeping with his brand of economic nation@@ alism .
and his decision to accept north korea ’ s invitation to hold bil@@ ateral talks on its nuclear program reflects the same “ bring it on ” attitude that he applied to the north ’ s earlier threats of war .
the up@@ coming test will be historic because it promises to reveal the true strengths and attitudes of the world ’ s rising power vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis the weak@@ ened but still leading in@@ cum@@ bent power .
for better or worse , the result could shape the world for decades to come .
on the trade front , china ’ s large bil@@ ateral surplus with the us could mean that it has more to lose from a trade war , simply because it has more exports that can be pen@@ alized .
it is often said that surplus countries will always be the biggest los@@ ers in any ti@@ t-@@ for-@@ tat escal@@ ation of tari@@ ffs and other barriers .
but this assumption mis@@ ses multiple points .
for one thing , china is more economically resilient to the effects of a trade war than it used to be .
trade as a share of its total economic activity has hal@@ ved in the past decade , from more than 60 % of gdp in 2007 to just over 30 % today .
china also has major advantages in terms of domestic politics and international diplomacy .
as a dictator@@ ship , china can ignore prote@@ sts by workers and companies suffering from us tari@@ ffs .
in the us , where mid-@@ term con@@ gressi@@ onal elections will be held this november , the out@@ cry from expor@@ ters , impor@@ ters , and consumers facing higher costs will be heard loud and clear .
of course , trum@@ p , too , might ignore prote@@ sts against his trade war if he is convinced that taking on china will please his core voters and win him re-@@ election in 2020 .
but con@@ gressi@@ onal republicans will probably feel differently , especially if their states or distri@@ cts are among those being sing@@ led out by chinese import tari@@ ffs .
in terms of international diplomacy , trum@@ p ’ s trade war will help china present itself as the defen@@ der of the rul@@ es-@@ based international order and multi@@ lat@@ eral institutions such as the world trade organization .
the w@@ to does not recognize china as a market economy , o@@ wing to the chinese government ’ s significant involvement in industry and alle@@ ged theft of intellectual property .
but china will have a chance to play the victim , while arguing that the us now poses the single largest threat to the global trading system that it helped create .
and if a us-@@ initi@@ ated trade war dra@@ gs on , china ’ s case will become only stronger as more countries suffer the disruptive effects of tari@@ ffs .
of course , china may choose not to fight trum@@ p ’ s trade war at all .
with symbolic conc@@ essions – such as an agreement to import us-@@ produced li@@ que@@ fied natural gas or promises to offer new guarante@@ es for intellec@@ tu@@ al-@@ property rights – it could convince trum@@ p to stand down .
but if x@@ i suspe@@ cts that a show of strength will bol@@ ster china ’ s international standing while under@@ cutting that of the us , he may decide to act accor@@ d@@ ingly .
but here , too , china will have an advantage .
even bar@@ ring real progress in the talks , china already looks like a good global citizen .
over the past year , it has been pres@@ suring the north korean leader , kim jon@@ g-@@ un , to negotiate .
by participating in coordinated economic san@@ ctions against the kim regime , and by repor@@ tedly ca@@ pping vital exports of oil and other essenti@@ als to the north , china has played its part in bringing kim to the table .
on paper , the fundamental question is whether north korea will be willing to abandon its nu@@ clear@@ -@@ weapons program , the fruit of more than 30 years of work .
and as china well knows , north korea would never give up its nuclear weapons without major changes in the military balance on and around the korean pen@@ insu@@ la .
kim will likely offer to den@@ u@@ clear@@ ize sol@@ ely on the condition that the us with@@ draw its forces from south korea , and perhaps from japan , too .
bar@@ ring that , he would not feel secure enough to do without the nuclear de@@ terr@@ ence on which he has sta@@ ked his regime ’ s survival .
at best , he could agree on a process through which such extraordinary moves might be discussed at a later date .
either way , china comes out on top .
in the event of stal@@ e@@ mate , it will have gotten kim to the table and put america in the position of being a ref@@ us@@ en@@ ik .
and if the us does agree to any military conc@@ essions , china ’ s strategic position will be streng@@ th@@ ened .
the only real question for x@@ i , then , is whether he wants to ass@@ ert china ’ s top-@@ dog status now , or sometime in the future .
the world according to x@@ i
beijing – on november 15 x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping became general secretary of the chinese communist party and chair@@ man of the c@@ cp ’ s central military commission , giving him supreme authority over china ’ s armed forces .
next march , he will become president of china as well .
how does china ’ s new leader see the world , and how will he handle the country ’ s foreign policy ?
do his style and preferences differ significantly from those of his pre@@ de@@ cess@@ or , hu j@@ inta@@ o ?
the answers will determine china ’ s relations with the world , and vice versa , for the next decade .
china ’ s leaders approach power in a very different way than do political leaders in , say , the united states .
american politicians must sell their ideas and values to voters ; china ’ s leaders do not need to inform the press and the public directly about anything , including their foreig@@ n-@@ policy positions .
indeed , with the not@@ able exceptions of mao ze@@ d@@ ong and deng xia@@ oping , china ’ s leaders have sel@@ dom imposed their own personalities upon chinese diplomacy .
in this sense , x@@ i ’ s leadership style will most likely continue in the tradition of his pre@@ de@@ cess@@ ors .
nevertheless , x@@ i ’ s out@@ look and worldview are surely different from hu ’ s .
for star@@ ters , x@@ i is part of a generation raised and educated mostly in china ’ s reform era , which has been a decisi@@ ve influence in their lives .
china opened itself to the world in 1978 , when x@@ i and his con@@ tempor@@ aries were young men eager to understand the world outside china .
they are a generation inspired by deng ’ s realistic approach to shat@@ tering the walls that radical le@@ f@@ ti@@ sts had built around china , and one that believes that knowledge can change the destiny of the country and its people .
when this generation assumes the man@@ tle of leadership , its members will turn their passion and curiosity about knowledge and innovation into real work .
they are surely willing to learn from the wider world as they seek to promote china ’ s national interests abroad and encourage gradu@@ al change at home .
x@@ i may address chinese diplomacy ’ s thor@@ ni@@ est issues – particularly sin@@ o-@@ us relations – with more re@@ alism and flexibility than in recent years .
his visit to the us in february 2012 was widely regarded as a sequel to deng ’ s visit in january 1979 .
x@@ i talked to president barack obama and visited the pentagon . he gave a lun@@ che@@ on speech and saw old friends from his brief stay in iowa as a young man .
he showed interest in american culture , just as deng did in 1979 .
he ate chocolate and watched n@@ ba games .
most important , instead of spending countless hours dre@@ arily discussing political and strategic topics , he spoke directly and vi@@ gor@@ ously about the current state of sin@@ o-@@ us relations . “ the pacific ocean is wide enough to accommo@@ date the two major countries of china and the us , ” he declared .
unhappy with america ’ s “ pi@@ vo@@ t ” to asia , x@@ i remained calm , but emphasi@@ zed that “ one cannot rely too much on military power regar@@ ding asi@@ a-@@ pacific diplomacy . ”
similarly , x@@ i tried to avoid major arguments on human rights , saying simply , “ there ’ s no best , only better . ” in essence , he sought to demonstrate that however many questions , arguments , and even potential conflicts exist between china and the us , both countries ’ leaders should address them with an attitude of cooperation and sin@@ cer@@ ity .
leaders should not become ent@@ an@@ gled in details that fuel suspi@@ cion of their counter@@ parts ’ mo@@ tives , lest they lose sight of the bigger picture .
x@@ i ’ s confidence exten@@ ds to china ’ s domestic politics .
his generation is more certain of reform than previous leadership co@@ hor@@ ts were , o@@ wing less to official ideology than to the country ’ s enormous achievements in the last three decades .
in practice , x@@ i may well prove to be a nation@@ alist ; certainly , his generation , like the founding fathers of the people ’ s republic , dreams of turning china into a stronger , more prosper@@ ous country .
the country ’ s new leaders want the world ’ s applause , but they are more eager for domestic o@@ vations .
like previous chinese leaders , x@@ i firmly believes that the world should respect china ’ s authority to manage its own affairs .
thus , he is willing to show diplo@@ matic muscle if china is challenged on a core area of concern .
his speech in mexico in 2009 demonstrated this . “ some foreig@@ ners with full bel@@ lies and nothing better to do engage in fing@@ er-@@ pointing at us , ” he said .
“ first , china does not export revolution ; second , it does not export famine and poverty ; and , third , it does not mess around with you .
so what else is there to say ? ”
x@@ i understands that the world expe@@ cts not only a better china , but also a china that is committed to construc@@ ting a better world .
he will be a tough and stron@@ g-@@ minded leader , but one who understands the world in a pragmatic way and knows how to work well with his foreign counter@@ parts .
indeed , his 2012 visit to the us left two impres@@ sions .
first , he is a leader at ease both in front of and away from the television cameras .
second , he is not afraid to have a little fun .
with those simple touches of humanity , x@@ i could bring a revolution to china ’ s diplomacy .
new york – the contrast between the dis@@ array in the west , on open display at the nato summit and at last month ’ s g@@ 7 meeting in canada , and china ’ s moun@@ ting international self-@@ confidence is growing clear@@ er by the day .
last month , the communist party of china ( c@@ pc ) concluded its central conference on work rel@@ ating to foreign affairs , the second since x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping became china ’ s un@@ dispu@@ ted rul@@ er in 2012 .
these meetings are not everyday affairs .
they are the clear@@ est expression of how the leadership sees china ’ s place in the world , but they tell the world much about china as well .
the last such conference , in 20@@ 14 , marked the funeral of deng xia@@ oping ’ s dic@@ tum of “ hide your strength , bi@@ de your time , never take the lead , ” and her@@ al@@ ded a new era of international ac@@ tivism .
in part , this change reflected x@@ i ’ s centr@@ alization of control , chinese leaders ’ conclusion that american power is in relative decline , and their view that china had become an in@@ dispen@@ s@@ able global economic player .
since 20@@ 14 , china has expanded and con@@ soli@@ dated its military position in the south china sea .
it took the idea of the new silk road and turned it into a multi-@@ trilli@@ on-@@ dollar trade , investment , infrastructure , and wider geo@@ political / geo-@@ economic initiative , engaging 73 different countries across much of eur@@ asia , africa and beyond .
and china signed up most of the developed world to the first large-scale non-@@ brett@@ on woods multi@@ lat@@ eral development bank , the asian infrastructure investment bank .
china has also launched diplo@@ matic initi@@ atives beyond its immediate sphere of strategic interest in east asia , as well as actively participating in initi@@ atives such as the 2015 iran nuclear deal .
it has developed na@@ val bases in sri lanka , pakistan , and d@@ ji@@ b@@ out@@ i , and participat@@ es in na@@ val exercis@@ es with russia as far away as the mediterranean and the bal@@ tic .
in march , china established its own international development agency .
the emergence of a coherent grand strategy ( regardless of whether the west choo@@ ses to recognize it as such ) is not all that has changed since 20@@ 14 .
for star@@ ters , the emphasis on the c@@ pc ’ s role is much stronger than before .
x@@ i , concerned that the party had become margin@@ al to the country ’ s major policy deb@@ ates , has reas@@ ser@@ ted party control over state institutions and given prece@@ dence to political ideology over techno@@ cratic policy@@ making .
x@@ i is determined to de@@ fy the tren@@ d-@@ line of western history , to see off francis fu@@ ku@@ y@@ ama ’ s “ end of history ” cul@@ min@@ ating in the general triumph of liberal democratic capitalism , and preserve a len@@ in@@ ist state for the long term .
this approach – known as “ x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping thought ” – now suff@@ uses china ’ s foreign policy framework .
in particular , x@@ i ’ s view that that there are identifi@@ able im@@ mu@@ table “ laws ” of historical development , both prescri@@ p@@ tive and predi@@ ctive , was particularly promin@@ ent at last month ’ s foreign policy conference .
if this sounds like old-fashioned dial@@ ec@@ tical materi@@ alism , that ’ s because it is .
x@@ i embra@@ ces the mar@@ xi@@ st-@@ len@@ in@@ ist tradition as his preferred intellectual framework .
given its emphasis on iron laws of political and economic development , a dial@@ ec@@ tic@@ al-@@ materi@@ alist worldview means that there is nothing random about world events .
so , x@@ i argues , if marx ’ s analytical framework is applied to the current period , it is clear that the global order is at a turning point , with the west ’ s relative decline coinci@@ ding with the for@@ tu@@ it@@ ous national and international circumstances enabling china ’ s rise .
in x@@ i ’ s words , “ china has been in the best period of development since modern times , while the world is under@@ going the most profound and unprecedented changes in a century . ” of course , for@@ mid@@ able obstacles lie ahead for china .
but x@@ i has concluded that the obstacles facing the us and the west are greater .
how such thinking will now drive china ’ s concrete foreign policy is anyone ’ s guess .
but how one-@@ party states , particularly mar@@ x@@ ist states , choose to “ ide@@ ate ” reality matters a great deal : it is how the system speaks to itself .
and x@@ i ’ s message to china ’ s foreign policy elite is one of great confidence .
specifically , the central conference called for the country ’ s international policy institutions and personnel to embrace x@@ i ’ s agenda .
here x@@ i seems to have the foreign ministry in his si@@ ghts .
there is a strong ideological flavor to x@@ i ’ s apparent frustration with the ministry ’ s gl@@ ac@@ ial approach to policy innovation .
china ’ s diplo@@ mats were ur@@ ged to bear in mind that they are first and foremost “ party cad@@ res , ” suggesting that x@@ i is likely to push the foreign policy apparatus toward greater ac@@ tivism , to give full effect to his emerging global vision .
the biggest change to emerge from last month ’ s conference concerns global governance .
in 20@@ 14 , x@@ i referred to an im@@ pen@@ ding struggle for the future structure of the international order .
while he did not elaborate , much work has since been devoted to three inter-@@ related concepts : gu@@ o@@ ji z@@ hi@@ x@@ u ( the international order ) ; gu@@ o@@ ji x@@ it@@ ong ( the international system ) , and qu@@ an@@ q@@ i@@ u z@@ hil@@ i ( global governance ) .
of course , these terms have different and over@@ la@@ pping meanings in english , too .
but , broadly speaking , in chinese , the term “ international order ” refers to a combination of the united nations , the brett@@ on woods institutions , the g@@ 20 , and other multi@@ lat@@ eral institutions ( which china accep@@ ts ) , as well as the us system of global alli@@ ances ( which china does not ) .
the term “ international system ” tends to refer to the first half of this international order : the complex web of multi@@ lat@@ eral institutions that operate under international treaty law and seek to govern the global commons on the basis of the principle of shared sovereig@@ n@@ ty .
and “ global governance ” den@@ ot@@ es the actual performance of the “ international system ” so defined .
what is start@@ l@@ ingly new about x@@ i ’ s re@@ marks at the central conference was his call for china now to “ lead the reform of the global governance system with the concepts of fairness and justice . ”
this is by far the most direct statement of china ’ s intentions on this important question offered so far .
the world should buck@@ le up and get ready for a new wave of chinese international policy ac@@ tivism .
like much of the rest of the international community , china is acu@@ tely conscious of the dys@@ func@@ tionality of much of the current multi@@ lat@@ eral system .
so x@@ i ’ s wish to lead “ reform of the global governance system ” is no accident .
it reflects growing diplo@@ matic ac@@ tivism in multi@@ lat@@ eral institutions , in order to re@@ orient them in a direction more compatible with what china regar@@ ds as its “ core national interests . ”
x@@ i has reminded china ’ s international policy elite that the tot@@ ality of china ’ s future foreign policy direction , including the reform of global governance , must be driven by these core national interests .
in this context , china also wants a more “ multi@@ polar ” international system .
this is code for a world in which the role of the united states and the west is substan@@ tially reduced .
the challenge for the rest of the international community is to define what type of global order we now want .
what do existing institutions like the european union , the association of southeast asian nations , or the african union want for the international rul@@ es-@@ based system for the future ?
what exactly does the us want , with or without trum@@ p ?
and how will we collectively preserve the global values embodied in the un charter , the brett@@ on woods institutions , and the universal declar@@ ation of human rights ?
china has a clear script for the future .
it ’ s time for the rest of the international community to develop one of its own .
this is an edited version of an address delivered to the lee ku@@ an ye@@ w school of public policy at the national university of singapore .
x@@ i of arabia
beijing – those who have criticized china ’ s cau@@ tious foreign policy need to re@@ consider their position , following president x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping ’ s ju@@ st-@@ completed visit to saudi arabia and iran – two major middle eastern powers that are currently at each other ’ s thro@@ ats .
the vis@@ its reflect the more active foreig@@ n-@@ policy approach that x@@ i has spe@@ ar@@ headed , particularly in the middle east .
this new approach raises an important question : can china ’ s impact on the region be more construc@@ tive than that of the united states ?
now is certainly a tense time to become involved in the middle east , a region where , as richard n. ha@@ ass argues , a new thir@@ ty years ’ war , in which “ civil wars and pro@@ xy wars become impossible to distinguish , ” is unfolding .
a key factor in unle@@ ash@@ ing the current chaos – which represents the convergence of numerous deep-@@ rooted challenges and conflicts – was america ’ s 2003 invasion of iraq .
by eliminating saddam hussein ’ s sun@@ ni regime , the us pa@@ ved the way for a shi@@ a-@@ led government , a development that til@@ ted the regional balance of power toward iran and left sun@@ ni@@ -@@ ruled saudi arabia feeling en@@ cir@@ cled by a shi@@ a coalition .
that is why iran and saudi arabia are so deeply involved in syria ’ s civil war .
they know that the fate of president bas@@ har al-@@ as@@ sad ’ s al@@ a@@ wi@@ te regime will have significant implications for the regional order .
for saudi arabia , rein@@ ing in iran is all the more important in the wake of the recent agreement on the country ’ s nuclear program , which has resulted in the li@@ fting of international economic san@@ ctions that have long constrained iran ’ s regional leadership ambi@@ tions .
of course , neither saudi arabia nor iran – or turkey , which has also joined the competition for regional influence – is seeking a direct confron@@ tation .
these countries would rather empower other actors , even if it means fu@@ eling dangerous religious radi@@ c@@ alization and the priva@@ tization of violence .
the terrorist movements that have emerged as a result of this approach – namely , the islamic state – cannot be defeated using traditional counter-@@ terrorism operations .
to be sure , these middle east ri@@ vals are not the only ones involved in the region ’ s current qu@@ ag@@ mi@@ re .
external powers like france , russia , and , of course , the us are also deeply involved , each with its own geo@@ political obje@@ ctives .
now china is entering the fra@@ y , bringing a uniquely construc@@ tive vision with it .
the two characters that com@@ prise the chinese word for crisis ( 危@@ 机 ) mean , individually , “ danger ” ( 危 ) and “ opportunity ” ( 机 ) .
that is precisely what china sees in today ’ s middle east .
for most of the relevant actors , highly per@@ il@@ ous geo@@ political competition is over@@ sha@@ do@@ wing vast economic opportunities .
not for china .
as x@@ i put it on his recent visit to cairo : “ instead of looking for a pro@@ xy in the middle east , we promote peace talks ; instead of seeking any sphere of influence , we call on all parties to join the circle of friends for the belt and road initiative . ”
this reflects the broader foreig@@ n-@@ policy re@@ balancing that x@@ i has been pursuing since taking office in 2013 .
unlike the us , which has been engineering a strategic “ pi@@ vo@@ t ” from one geographic region to another , china is re@@ balancing from “ politics among nations ” to “ politics among networks , ” focusing on “ connectivity ” rather than “ control . ”
the middle east is crucial to this connec@@ tivi@@ ty-@@ oriented grand strategy , not least because of its key role in the “ one belt , one road ” project that x@@ i promot@@ ed in cairo .
china ’ s determination to re@@ establish the ancient silk roads – including the over@@ land route that runs through the middle east – has led it to enter into strategic partnerships with eight arab countries in recent years , and to sign agre@@ ements with six arab countries to pursue the initiative jo@@ in@@ tly .
iran , turkey , and seven arab countries are among the founding members of the bei@@ j@@ ing-@@ based asian infrastructure investment bank , a key institution for finan@@ cing related infrastructure projects .
but china is not waiting for the one belt , one road initiative to be completed before pursuing increased trade with middle eastern countries .
during his recent visit to saudi arabia , he cla@@ imed that free-@@ trade negotiations between the gulf cooperation council and china should be concluded this year .
moreover , x@@ i announced that china will issue $ 55 billion in loans to the middle east , including a $ 15 billion special loan for industri@@ alization , $ 10 billion in commercial loans to boost production capacity , and $ 10 billion in conc@@ essi@@ onal loans .
the remaining $ 20 billion will go toward a joint investment fund with the united arab e@@ mir@@ ates and qatar to invest in traditional energy , infrastructure development , and high-@@ end manufacturing industries in the region .
all of this alig@@ ns with the “ 1 + 2 + 3 ” cooperation pattern that x@@ i proposed at the june 20@@ 14 ministeri@@ al conference of the chin@@ a-@@ arab states cooperation forum in beijing .
according to this approach , energy cooperation should form the core of collaboration , while infrastructure construction and trade and investment form two wings .
nuclear power , satellites , and new energy sources are three high-tech areas where cooperation can lead to important breakthroughs .
here , the goal is to take advantage of the region ’ s energy resources , while helping it to industri@@ alize and diversi@@ fy its economy .
of course , china ’ s success in the middle east requires progress on mi@@ tig@@ ating the region ’ s ten@@ sions , cooling its hot@@ spots , and stabili@@ zing weak countries – all of which will require smart diplomacy by many actors .
but peace and development are inex@@ tri@@ c@@ ably linked .
to turn the tide against extremism , middle eastern countries must be able to provide economic opportunities to their people , and these can only be secu@@ red through trade , investment , and jobs .
in this fundamental respect , china has a lot to offer the middle east – and president x@@ i has once again shown his determination to offer it .
new haven – china ’ s qu@@ in@@ qu@@ en@@ ni@@ al communist party con@@ gr@@ esses are that rare event where ritual and dog@@ ma combine with intro@@ spe@@ ction and strategy .
the 19th national congress , which began on october 18 , is no exception .
not@@ with@@ standing the suspen@@ se over potential changes in party leadership , which typically occur at the end of the meeting , president x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping ’ s political report , delivered on the opening day , was a high-@@ impact event .
significantly , it says as much about the party as it does about x@@ i .
as alice miller , a leading sin@@ ologist at stanford ’ s ho@@ over institution , emphasi@@ zes , the report was carefully crafted over a one-@@ year period to convey the consensus of the party ’ s highest organ , the 20@@ 5-@@ member central committee .
three conclusions from x@@ i ’ s address are particularly important .
for star@@ ters , the ideological under@@ pinn@@ ings of “ x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping thought ” have been raised to the same lo@@ fty level as those of “ mao ze@@ d@@ ong thought , ” effectively elev@@ ating x@@ i over his three pre@@ de@@ cess@@ ors – hu j@@ inta@@ o , ji@@ ang z@@ em@@ in , and even the re@@ vered deng xia@@ oping .
much has been written about x@@ i ’ s con@@ soli@@ dation of power since he was ap@@ pointed general secretary in november 2012 .
but this elev@@ ation makes it official .
after only five years in office , the party leadership has an@@ o@@ in@@ ted x@@ i as one of modern china ’ s two greatest historic figures .
second , the political report speaks with great confidence about a china that has now entered a “ new era . ”
but by under@@ sc@@ oring the chinese ada@@ ge that the “ … last leg of a journey just marks the halfway point , ” x@@ i sket@@ ched an even more ambitious future .
china ’ s si@@ ghts are now set on two goals – comple@@ ting the task of building the so-called moder@@ ately prosper@@ ous society by 20@@ 35 , and then establi@@ shing its position as a great power by 2050 .
unlike china ’ s go@@ al-@@ setting exercis@@ es in the past , there are no quantitative targets attached to these “ twin cent@@ en@@ ary goals ” ( which roughly alig@@ n with the party ’ s founding in 19@@ 21 and the establishment of the people ’ s republic of china in 1949 ) .
they celebrate the long-@@ awa@@ ited national re@@ juven@@ ation that x@@ i has du@@ b@@ bed the china dream .
the third point is perhaps the most intriguing .
this is cou@@ ched in the form of china ’ s “ principal contradiction ” – a mar@@ x@@ ist concept that serves as an ad@@ mission of a fundamental problem requ@@ ir@@ ing resolution .
the principal contradiction , while typically ellip@@ tical and ambiguous , frames a rich discussion of risks and opportunities , strategy and tactics , reforms and governance – all of which will shape china ’ s pro@@ spe@@ cts for the fores@@ ee@@ able future .
the big news is that , under x@@ i ’ s leadership , the party has re@@ vised its principal contradiction for the first time since 1981 .
whereas the contradiction had previously been fra@@ med as a trade@@ off between the needs of the people and china ’ s “ backward social production , ” it is now viewed as a tension between “ un@@ balanced and inadequate development ” and the “ people ’ s ever-@@ growing needs for a better life . ”
this re@@ statement of the principal contradiction has not emerged from thin air .
it clearly signals a far-@@ reaching change in national perspective – from that of a poor developing country to that of an increasingly prosper@@ ous society focused on becoming a great power .
it is also consistent with the cri@@ ti@@ que of former premi@@ er wen ji@@ ab@@ ao , who in march 2007 famously war@@ ned of a chinese economy that was becoming increasingly “ unstable , un@@ balanced , un@@ coordinated , and &#91; ultimately &#93; unsustainable . ”
over the past ten years , two five-@@ year plans – the 12th , en@@ acted in 2011 , and the 13@@ th , en@@ acted in 20@@ 16 – plus a major set of reforms adopted at the so-called third plen@@ um in 2013 , have aimed to resolve china ’ s persistent and wor@@ ris@@ ome im@@ balances .
x@@ i ’ s political report doesn ’ t alter the main thrust of those efforts .
the real significance is that re@@ balancing is now ens@@ hr@@ ined within the party ’ s ideological under@@ pinn@@ ings .
it is a foun@@ da@@ tional pill@@ ar of x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping thought .
the political report ’ s focus on china ’ s principal contradiction also raises important questions about what still may be missing from the party ’ s long-term strategy .
three “ secondary contradi@@ ctions ” are especially striking on the economic front .
first , there is ongoing tension between the role of the state and that of markets in gui@@ ding resource allo@@ cation .
this was a gl@@ aring contradiction of the 2013 third plen@@ um reforms , which focused on the seemingly in@@ consistent combination of a “ decisi@@ ve role ” for markets and ste@@ ad@@ fast support for state ownership .
the party has long believed that these two features of economic life are compatible – the so-called bl@@ ended economy with chinese characteristics .
x@@ i ’ s political report pra@@ ises the mixed ownership model and also asp@@ ires to an economy led by great firms with un@@ matched global competitive pro@@ w@@ ess .
but it glo@@ s@@ ses over the thor@@ ny issue of state-@@ owned enterprise reform that may be required to resolve this contradiction and avoid the japanese “ z@@ om@@ bie ” problem of a chronic debt over@@ hang .
second , there is the tension between supply and demand .
consistent with other recent pronoun@@ c@@ ements of senior chinese officials , the political report leaves little doubt that sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ side structural reforms are now the highest priority of economic policymakers .
the related emphasis on productivity , innovation , pr@@ un@@ ing excess capacity , and moving up the value chain in manufacturing and services are under@@ sc@@ ored as key building blocks of this effort .
at the same time , the report de-@@ emphasi@@ zes consumer spending and services – now buried deep in the list of priorities for a moderni@@ zed economy .
yet focusing on supply without paying equal attention to the foundations of aggregate demand is a puzz@@ ling and potentially wor@@ ris@@ ome disconnect .
a final secondary tension can be found in the contrast between the path and the destination .
not@@ with@@ standing all the self-@@ con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ atory flour@@ ishes in x@@ i ’ s political report , there is good reason to believe that the chinese economy is only in the early stages of its long-@@ her@@ al@@ ded structural transformation .
its services sector is growing rapidly , but is still embryonic , accounting for just 52 % of gdp .
and household consumption , which is also growing rapidly , is still less than 40 % of gdp .
china may well be on a path to a new normal or a new era .
but the final destination remains far down the road , with many contradi@@ ctions to be resolved during the journey .
yale ’ s safe sex criminals
new york – in october 2010 , the current brothers of george w. bush ’ s former fr@@ ater@@ nity at yale , delta ka@@ pp@@ a ep@@ sil@@ on , mar@@ ched through the first-@@ year qu@@ ad chan@@ ting , “ no means yes !
yes means an@@ al ! ” they held up signs reading , “ we love yale slu@@ ts . ”
six@@ teen graduate and undergraduate students , male and female , felt that the university ’ s administration then did little to push back against such en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ments on female students ’ rights to a fair and non-@@ threatening learning environment .
in march , they fil@@ ed a federal law@@ suit against yale , alle@@ ging that its “ failure to address inci@@ dents of sexual har@@ ass@@ ment and sexual assau@@ lt has created a ‘ hostile environment . ’ ”
the law@@ suit did not stop with the d@@ ke incident .
first-@@ year women were ran@@ ked on their sex appeal , the compla@@ int not@@ ed , and , most seriously , yale failed to respond adequ@@ ately to reports of sexual assau@@ lt or attempted assau@@ lt and stal@@ king .
according to alexand@@ ra bro@@ d@@ sky , a yale junior and one of the 16 compla@@ in@@ ants , the students are “ really frustrated and disappointed that yale again and again fails to respond to both public and private acts of sexual har@@ ass@@ ment and assau@@ l@@ ts , which … perpetu@@ ates an environment in which these … acts are okay . ”
the students ’ compla@@ int coinci@@ des with a federal investigation by the department of education ’ s office for civil rights , which announced that it would review yale ’ s policies for dealing with sexual har@@ ass@@ ment and sexual assau@@ lt .
this is no small matter : yale and other american universities receive millions of federal dollars annu@@ ally – money that would be je@@ opar@@ di@@ zed if the university was found to tolerate an unequal learning environment .
in 2004 , i wrote an article for new york magazine about my own experience of having been sexually en@@ cro@@ ached upon as a third-@@ year undergraduate at yale by an este@@ em@@ ed professor ( the crime of “ sexual har@@ ass@@ ment ” had not yet been codi@@ fied ) .
i wrote , too , about yale ’ s cover@@ -up of many situations like mine .
so the students ’ law@@ suit was not surprising to me .
indeed , in the course of trying to report to the university in 2004 what had happened to me in 1983 , i found the same pattern of st@@ one@@ w@@ alling victims and defending perpetr@@ ators .
worse still , i discovered that the university and its lawyers used the sexual har@@ ass@@ ment “ gri@@ ev@@ ance procedure ” as a screen to protect the institution , its har@@ ass@@ ers , and even its rapi@@ sts , rather than as a means to investigate inci@@ dents of abuse .
this situation had persi@@ sted for two decades .
as i conducted my reporting , i heard woman after woman alle@@ ge that the same professor or the same fr@@ ater@@ nity had engaged in multiple instances of assau@@ lt or har@@ ass@@ ment .
victim after victim would ple@@ ad , heart@@ break@@ ingly , “ help me . ”
but i could do nothing , because the women chose to remain anonymous , and because the university treated each case as top secret .
alle@@ ged perpetr@@ ators were free to teach in a new university – where more young women ( and in some cases , young men ) would become their prey .
com@@ po@@ unding the lack of transparency , yale main@@ tains its own campus police force , to which sex@@ -@@ crime victims are encouraged to report their compla@@ ints if they insist upon formal docum@@ entation .
but victims often do not understand that this actually tends to contain potentially embarrassing sc@@ and@@ als , by preventing real – that is , accountable – law en@@ for@@ cement from getting involved .
indeed , there have been dis@@ closed to me reports of at least three alle@@ ged sex assau@@ l@@ ts by faculty or academic staff in the past decade – two alle@@ ged inci@@ dents reported by two different women involving the same man .
i know that one undergraduate has more recently pursu@@ ed legal action against a staff member , who , she said , dru@@ gged her with roh@@ yp@@ no@@ l , the “ date rape ” drug , and assau@@ l@@ ted her .
i know these accounts , but i can ’ t report them , even at this critical moment in the long-@@ over@@ due formal investigation , because of confi@@ denti@@ ality proto@@ col@@ s .
each of these women feels alone .
like virtually every private university in the united states , yale has reli@@ ed on “ privacy ” to keep these inci@@ dents under wra@@ ps , so that in@@ coming women ( and men ) have no idea who among the faculty or students is dangerous ; which fr@@ ater@@ nity is a site of repeated har@@ ass@@ ment or worse ; and when to keep the door open on a stud@@ ent-@@ teacher meeting .
like the catholic church , private universities like yale can use victims ’ shame and isolation to dis@@ en@@ franch@@ ise them and to protect the perpetr@@ ators .
but i believe that the victims themselves have a responsibility .
the convention of taking sex@@ -@@ crime testimony from alle@@ ged victims behind closed doors , under conditions of anony@@ mity or confi@@ denti@@ ality , only serves institutions like universities or the military that are intent on covering up criminal behavior .
some femini@@ sts have attacked me for this position , but the numbers bear me out : thir@@ ty years ago , 30 % of reported ra@@ pes in the us and the united kingdom resulted in pro@@ secu@@ tions ; today , after three decades of confi@@ den@@ tial sex@@ -@@ crime reporting , the number is 12 % in the us and 6 % in the uk .
this is largely because confi@@ denti@@ ality in sex@@ -@@ crime reporting prevents the media from shining a light on the crime , inhi@@ bits institutional memory of repeated as@@ sail@@ ants , and prevents scru@@ tiny of whether a court , college , or police pre@@ cin@@ ct is doing better or worse at handling such cases .
as a result , serious crimes can be swept under the ru@@ g – at yale and at every other private us university i have ever visited ( public universities are less free to conce@@ al crime data ) – in the gu@@ ise of “ protecting the victims . ”
yale alum@@ na@@ e are repor@@ tedly now cont@@ acting these 16 students with their own stories of sexual assau@@ lt and har@@ ass@@ ment , span@@ ning two decades .
but if they had come forward publicly years ago , it is likely that yale could not have continued for so long to protect the sex criminals in its midst .
the students are right : a sexually ab@@ u@@ sive environment does make it harder for students to study and learn .
but victims – whether current students or alum@@ na@@ e – would be well advis@@ ed to take a deep breath , come forward , and tell their stories out loud .
only then would yale and other institutions be forced to reck@@ on publicly with a problem that has persi@@ sted for generations .
yan@@ ke@@ e bases go home
rio de jan@@ ei@@ ro – last month , the leaders of all 12 countries of south america ( except one ) gathered in quito , ecuador ’ s capital , for the summit of the union of south american nations .
un@@ as@@ ur or un@@ as@@ ul ( depending on whether one speaks spanish or portu@@ gu@@ ese ) was established by the twel@@ ve presidents in bras@@ í@@ lia in may 2008 with the aim of further@@ ing economic and political integration .
instead , venezu@@ el@@ an president hu@@ go ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z hi@@ jac@@ ked the quito meeting to propag@@ ate his boli@@ vari@@ an revolution and ex@@ pound his own ideas for the continent ’ s future as independent of the united states .
thanks to america ’ s recently announced military agreement with colom@@ bia , ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z ’ s ideas got more of a hearing than might have been expected .
for , instead of infrastructure plans , commercial or environmental treaties , or even multi@@ lat@@ eral action against such common problems as violence and poverty , the issue that dominated both press accounts and the speeches at the gathering was the new us-@@ colom@@ bian military agreement , announced less than a month before the summit .
to no one ’ s surprise , ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z dominated the criticism of the p@@ act .
he cla@@ imed that the “ winds of war are blowing , ” and that the announcement of the military agreement “ can transform itself into a tragedy . ”
unfortunately , colom@@ bian president á@@ l@@ var@@ o uri@@ be was ab@@ sent from the meeting .
colom@@ bia and ecuador broke diplo@@ matic relations in march 2008 , after colom@@ bia ’ s army pursu@@ ed far@@ c guer@@ illas , who have been fighting colom@@ bia ’ s government for decades , into ecuad@@ ore@@ an territory .
so uri@@ be could not defend the new military agreement .
this left the floor open to ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z to isol@@ ate colom@@ bia and pre@@ ach against the us .
in a continent where anti-@@ americ@@ an@@ ism remains both very popular and an effective way to con@@ soli@@ date national co@@ h@@ esi@@ on and political power , ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z ’ s attacks found a ready audience .
in addition , uri@@ be ’ s absence allowed ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z to avoid responding to colom@@ bia ’ s acc@@ us@@ ations that venezuela and its ally ecuador support the nar@@ co-@@ mar@@ x@@ ist far@@ c .
one week after the summit , us secretary of state hillary clinton tried to calm the continent ’ s fears about the us-@@ colom@@ bia agreement , explaining that it is merely a minor re@@ vision of the bill clin@@ ton-@@ era plan colom@@ bia , an american program to support the government against the drug car@@ tel@@ s .
but her words did little so@@ o@@ thing .
nor did it seem to help that even most local military analy@@ sts say that the agreement does not represent any major change in the us military position on the continent .
the simple fact is that the timing of the announcement of the p@@ act was terrible , and gave a platform for boli@@ vari@@ an rants that will not be without consequences .
indeed , the ongoing fall@@ out is likely to remain very negative .
by raising anti-@@ american suspi@@ ci@@ ons and streng@@ th@@ ening ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z ’ s position across the continent , the agreement weak@@ ens the influence of brazil .
recently , brazil had been differenti@@ ating itself from the rest of the continent through its stable economy and vibrant democratic political system , both of which were helping the country ’ s poor .
so the spread and streng@@ th@@ ening of ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z ’ s so-called boli@@ vari@@ an revolution was not in brazil ’ s interests , even though some of president lu@@ i@@ z in@@ á@@ ci@@ o l@@ ula da sil@@ va ’ s officials appear to be fans of ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z and his administration .
the terrible timing of the us-@@ colom@@ bia military agreement also gave ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z and his allies a reason to build up their ar@@ mies against the “ evil imperi@@ alist i@@ an@@ que . ”
after all , one must remember , the boli@@ vari@@ an revolution ’ s supposed “ enemy � � is the us , and no one else .
so the agreement may legiti@@ mize and produce an arms race in south america , which is in no one ’ s interest .
another unexpected consequence of the us-@@ colom@@ bia military agreement may be a further hei@@ ghten@@ ing of ten@@ sions between venezuela and colom@@ bia .
the radical polari@@ zation of the an@@ dean region between those two countries will create difficulties in building regional consensus and security problems in the amazon , as well as weak@@ ening the brazilian project for south american political and economic integration .
finally , another major consequence of the us-@@ colom@@ bia deal are the doub@@ ts that it has created in latin america about president barack obama ’ s administration , and about the future of relations between the us and south america , especially brazil , the main regional power .
the agreement revi@@ ved the perception that us diplomacy lac@@ ks sensitivity where the region is concerned .
if obama wants to encourage moder@@ ate and democratic politics in south america , and to bol@@ ster brazil ’ s efforts to foster stability and economic progress against the region ’ s radical and un@@ democratic forces , it must take greater care in not appearing to under@@ mine those the us claims to support .
for ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z is showing that the old cry of “ yan@@ ke@@ e go home ” still reson@@ ates .
the peripher@@ y ’ s pur@@ g@@ atory
ath@@ ens – german chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a mer@@ kel ’ s up@@ coming visit to ath@@ ens will be a far less tense aff@@ air than her earlier jour@@ neys here during europe ’ s long financial crisis .
of course , greeks have little love for mer@@ kel ; but , thanks to europe ’ s modest economic recovery , some of the poison has been drawn from germany ’ s relations with europe ’ s most damaged and dist@@ ressed economies .
indeed , europe is no longer considered a risk to global financial stability .
the euro@@ zone ’ s core economies are showing signs of revi@@ val , and financial conditions in the over-@@ inde@@ b@@ ted peripher@@ y are improving as well .
but , given capital shor@@ tages , depressed demand , and the slow pace of reform in the euro@@ zone peripher@@ y , continued progress is far from certain .
in the euro@@ zone economies that were hit hardest by the global economic crisis , the output and employment losses have been huge and persistent .
real ( infla@@ tion-@@ adju@@ sted ) per capita income in the euro@@ zone as a whole ho@@ vers around its 2007 level ; in greece and italy , however , it has sun@@ k to the levels recorded in 2000 and 1997 , respe@@ ctively .
meanwhile , the euro@@ zone ’ s overall unemployment rate is 12 % , and it is much higher in the peripher@@ y .
in spain , more than 25 % of the labor force is job@@ less , while italy ’ s youth unemployment rate stands at 42 % .
in greece , where the overall unemployment rate has climbed to 28 % , some 60 % of the country ’ s young people are unemployed .
reco@@ vering from such cri@@ p@@ pling employment losses will not be easy , and will require a spee@@ dy return to high and sustainable growth rates .
consider greece , where the government is planning a return to the capital markets in the coming months to finance the country ’ s long-term borrowing needs , even though se@@ cur@@ ing such finan@@ cing would require paying un@@ sustain@@ ably high interest rates .
the fact that the government seems willing to do so translates clearly its desire to move beyond the influence of the “ tro@@ i@@ ka ” ( the international mon@@ etary fund , the european commission , and the european central bank ) .
indeed , since 2008 , greece ’ s gdp has shr@@ unk by almost 25 % .
reco@@ vering lost capacity will require large amounts of capital , but there are five reasons why such finan@@ cing is unlikely , under present conditions , to be for@@ th@@ coming :
· as a result of au@@ ster@@ ity , public investment as a share of gdp continues to fall and has now reached a record low .
having already committed substantial rescue funds , euro@@ zone authorities do not seem in@@ clin@@ ed to inject fresh capital .
· sources of domestic private capital are limited , because the recession and the related near-@@ collapse of asset prices , along with a sharp increase in tax@@ ation – particularly on high incomes and on capital – significantly weak@@ ened balance sheets .
· bank len@@ ding has slowed dra@@ stically , as a result of greek banks effectively de@@ faul@@ ting in the wake of the tro@@ i@@ ka-@@ imposed losses on sovereig@@ n credi@@ tors and the nation@@ alization of the country ’ s banks .
a recor@@ d-@@ low level of depos@@ its and the rec@@ essi@@ on-@@ related rise of non-@@ performing loans have weak@@ ened greek banks ’ capital position further .
( today , companies in the euro@@ zone peripher@@ y borrow at substan@@ tially higher rates than their counter@@ parts in the core .
for bank loans , the ratio is almost two to one ; for long-term finan@@ cing , it may reach as high as ten to one . )
· greece ’ s unsustainable debt position is dis@@ coura@@ ging foreign private investment .
the assumptions about primary sur@@ pl@@ uses , privat@@ e-@@ sector involvement , and gdp growth underlying the government ’ s commitment to reduce its debt level , which currently exce@@ eds 170 % of gdp , to 1@@ 24 % of gdp by 2020 cannot be realized , given germany ’ s opposition to re@@ struc@@ turing the official finan@@ cing that replaced the de@@ faul@@ ted private loans .
some e@@ asing of loan condi@@ tionality – via extended ma@@ turi@@ ties and reduced interest rates ‒ will be agreed later this year , but it will not be enough to calm fears of a new default .
· trust between foreign and greek investors is lac@@ king , and it will not be restored until debt sustainability is achieved .
but germany and the other core euro@@ zone countries consistently block any proposal that con@@ tem@@ plates debt mu@@ tu@@ alization or fiscal union .
ideas such as euro@@ bonds , a single european finance ministry , and increased capit@@ alization of europe ’ s common rescue funds ( the european stability mechanism and the single resolution mechanism ) are not even being contempl@@ ated .
along with inadequate capital supply , greece is suffering from a demand short@@ fall , as the tro@@ i@@ ka continues to squeeze the country with harsh au@@ ster@@ ity .
if these policies are not relaxed or off@@ set by more expan@@ sion@@ ary policies in the euro@@ zone core , demand will remain depressed , dis@@ coura@@ ging further investment .
finally , on the reform front , time is running out .
for the last few years , rather than confron@@ ting the special interests – state-@@ protected businesses , publi@@ c-@@ sector trade uni@@ ons , and lob@@ bies – that inhi@@ bit reform , greece has spread its economic misery horizon@@ tally through blan@@ ket spending cuts .
reforms such as priva@@ tizing state-@@ owned enter@@ pris@@ es , opening up closed professions , abo@@ li@@ shing restri@@ ctive business practices , and reducing the size of the public sector have been under@@ taken very slowly and in@@ efficiently , and they will not significantly alter growth pro@@ spe@@ cts .
as it stands , greece is unlikely to meet the recovery challenge – and other peripher@@ al economies will probably fal@@ ter , too .
sufficient reforms and capital are lac@@ king , while the social ri@@ fts resul@@ ting from au@@ ster@@ ity increase the risk of potentially devastating political inst@@ ability .
with the european parliament election approaching , the prospect of popu@@ list anti-@@ au@@ ster@@ ity parties prevail@@ ing in the peripher@@ y – and of anti-@@ euro , anti-@@ bail@@ out parties gaining power in the core – hei@@ gh@@ tens the risk of inst@@ ability even more .
should financial turbul@@ ence return and her@@ ald a new euro@@ zone crisis , the mon@@ etary union ’ s sustainability will again be called into question .
to prevent this outcome , greece and the euro@@ zone ’ s other peripher@@ al economies must limit au@@ ster@@ ity , but@@ tress demand , under@@ take reform , increase investment support , and pursue fiscal union .
unfortunately , these keys to en@@ suring a co@@ h@@ esive and prosper@@ ous euro@@ zone are likely to be left un@@ turned – until , perhaps , the next crisis occurs .
china ’ s real-@@ estate wr@@ on@@ gs
beijing – china ’ s real-@@ estate sector has been a source of serious concern for several years , with so@@ aring property prices raising fears of over@@ heating in the housing market .
but , with price growth e@@ asing , it seems that the government ’ s campaign to rein in property risk is finally taking hold .
the danger now is that the housing market will collapse – bringing china ’ s economic pro@@ spe@@ cts down with it .
in its effort to control rising housing prices , china ’ s government has pursu@@ ed nine distinct policies , not all of which have served their purpose .
though policies like limits on mort@@ g@@ ages for first-@@ time bu@@ yers and minimum residen@@ cy requirements for purchasing property in a first-@@ tier city like beijing or shanghai helped to ease demand , sup@@ pl@@ y-@@ side tactics , such as limit@@ ing credit to real-@@ estate developers and im@@ posing new taxes on property sales , have proved to be counter-@@ productive .
this fla@@ wed approach allowed china ’ s housing prices to continue to rise ste@@ adily , fu@@ eling major housing bubbles , especially in first-@@ tier cities .
the average beijing resi@@ dent would have to save all of his or her income for 34 years before to be able to purchase an apartment ou@@ tri@@ ght .
in shanghai and gu@@ ang@@ zhou , the equivalent is 29 and 27 years , respe@@ ctively – much higher than in other major international cities .
the expectation that this trend will continue has driven home@@ owners to retain pos@@ session of their properties , even though r@@ ental rates amount to less than 2 % of a property ’ s market value .
but , with the real-@@ estate sector finally facing a down@@ turn , the time to rethink this investment strategy has arrived .
in the first four months of 20@@ 14 , housing sales dropped by nearly 7 % year on year , with construction of new floor area falling by more than 22 % .
as a result , down@@ ward pressure on property prices is moun@@ ting .
in normal times , citizens and officials alike would welcome this trend .
but , at a time of weak@@ ening economic performance , china cannot afford an im@@ plo@@ sion of the real-@@ estate sector , which accounts for at least 30 % of overall growth .
indeed , though china ’ s government has expressed its willingness to sacrifice some growth in its pursuit of structural reform and re@@ balancing , the impact of a hous@@ ing-@@ market collapse on the financial sector would cause growth to slow beyond the acceptable limit .
that impact partly reflects the highly problematic nature of the chinese government ’ s long-@@ awa@@ ited move to liber@@ alize interest rates .
instead of taking a direct approach – li@@ fting the interest@@ -@@ rate cap imposed on banks – liber@@ alization has been achieved by allowing shadow banking to flourish .
as a result , a large number of non@@ bank financial institutions – such as weal@@ th-@@ management companies and online finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ services providers – are now using promises of high returns to attract small investors .
making matters worse , the mon@@ etary authorities have ti@@ ghten@@ ed the credit supply , in an effort to dele@@ verage the chinese economy .
while both interest@@ -@@ rate liber@@ alization and dele@@ ver@@ aging are critical to the long-term health of china ’ s economy , the sky@@ rock@@ eting cost of borrowing is forcing many low-@@ risk companies , which are unable to offer suffici@@ ently high rates of return , out of the market .
at the same time , real-@@ estate developers who have bor@@ rowed heavily from sha@@ dow@@ -@@ banking institutions , based on the assumption that property prices would continue to rise ste@@ adily , may struggle to re@@ pay their deb@@ ts , with a sharp decline in prices inevitably leading to de@@ faul@@ ts .
given that the formal banking sector provides a large share of sha@@ dow@@ -@@ banking finance , this could initi@@ ate a chain reaction affecting the entire financial sector .
many remain convinced that china ’ s government – which wi@@ el@@ ds with the world ’ s largest foreig@@ n-@@ exchange reserves and virtually un@@ checked authority – would be able to prevent a major financial crisis .
but the financial crisis in the fast-@@ growing city of wen@@ zhou , triggered by bad loans , suggests otherwise – not least because the economy has yet to recover fully .
there is no reason to believe that a similar crisis could not occur on a national scale .
to avoid such an outcome , china ’ s leaders must ur@@ gently adopt counter-@@ cycli@@ cal measures .
they should begin by eliminating non-@@ market@@ -based restri@@ ctions on the real-@@ estate sector , which have generated serious distor@@ tions not only to the economy , but also to people ’ s lives , with couples divor@@ cing tempor@@ arily to gain the right to purchase an additional apartment .
when it comes to the real-@@ estate sector , china ’ s government has consistently had the right objective and the wrong strategy .
it is time to alig@@ n intention with action .
otherwise , china ’ s financial sector – indeed , its entire economy – will suffer .
the revolution europe needs
str@@ as@@ bour@@ g – the spontaneous street prote@@ sts in paris over the past month come almost exactly 50 years after the mass revol@@ t of may 1968 .
but that is not to say the two events are comparable .
les é@@ v@@ é@@ ne@@ ments de mai 1968 was an an@@ arch@@ ist u@@ prising by students and workers against the tradition@@ alism and apparent author@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism of president charles de gau@@ lle .
today ’ s “ yellow v@@ ests , ” by contrast , have es@@ che@@ wed intellectual and political debate , and quickly de@@ generated into a ri@@ oting mo@@ b .
what started as a decent , middle-class protest against a new tax on dies@@ el fuel has been hi@@ jac@@ ked by professional thu@@ gs and extremi@@ sts ra@@ iling against migr@@ ants , the european union , and french president emmanuel ma@@ cr@@ on . “ paris is burning , ” glo@@ ated steve ban@@ non , us president don@@ ald trum@@ p ’ s popu@@ list former con@@ sig@@ li@@ ere , at a recent appearance alongside marine le pen of the far-@@ right national r@@ ally ( for@@ mer@@ ly the national front ) .
according to ban@@ non , “ the yellow v@@ ests … are exactly the same type of people who elected don@@ ald trum@@ p … and who voted for bre@@ x@@ it . ”
worse still , the extrem@@ ist ac@@ tivism has already spread to neighbor@@ ing bel@@ gi@@ um and the netherlands , which now have yellow v@@ est movements of their own .
and in italy , mat@@ te@@ o sal@@ vin@@ i , the xen@@ opho@@ bic interior minister , has capit@@ alized on the riots to launch a broad@@ side against ma@@ cr@@ on ’ s policies . never mind that italy is in even more desperate need of a ma@@ cr@@ on-@@ style reform agenda than france .
the fact that al@@ t-@@ right ag@@ it@@ ators are using the yellow v@@ est movement as a platform to spe@@ w hate and lies should worry all europeans .
in one way or another , many of today ’ s popu@@ list parties and movements draw financial support from the kre@@ m@@ lin .
there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that the united kingdom ’ s 20@@ 16 bre@@ x@@ it refer@@ end@@ um was influenced by “ dark money ” from russia .
and russian tro@@ ll@@ s have continued to f@@ om@@ ent islam@@ opho@@ bic hatred across western europe .
the al@@ t-@@ right has been highly successful at explo@@ iting people ’ s fears to under@@ mine global solutions for global challenges such as migration and climate change .
for those struggling to make ends meet , right-@@ wing messaging about refugees and migr@@ ants taking jobs and destroying european culture can resonate power@@ fully .
and for rural households facing slightly higher fuel taxes , it is convenient to believe that climate change is just a ho@@ a@@ x propag@@ ated by political elites and “ the media . ”
a counter@@ movement against such dis@@ information is long past due .
the first step in ste@@ mming the popu@@ list , euro@@ skeptic tide is to tell the truth and point out the lies .
but let us not be naive .
counter@@ ing the al@@ t-@@ right threat to our societies will also require deep reform .
a common popu@@ list criticism of the eu is that it functions op@@ aqu@@ ely and often in@@ comprehen@@ si@@ bly .
yet , if anything , the eu tends to be rather weak in the face of global challenges .
contrary to popu@@ lists ’ claims of over@@ reach , european institutions almost always do “ too little , too late . ” that must change , and radically so .
we need to make the eu far more democratic , transparent , and effective – which is to say , more sovereig@@ n – than it is today .
this does not require us to reinvent the wheel .
we need only return to the ideas of europe ’ s founding fathers : jean mon@@ net , pau@@ l-@@ hen@@ ri spa@@ ak , robert schu@@ man , al@@ cide de gas@@ per@@ i , and others .
these leaders had a clear vision of a simpler yet stronger union , led not by a 2@@ 8-@@ member commission , but by a real government with 12 ministers .
they would have allowed europeans to vote directly for a parliament with full compe@@ ten@@ cies and leg@@ isla@@ tive authority , and without the system of un@@ anim@@ ity that has allowed ro@@ gue member states such as hung@@ ary to tie the entire blo@@ c ’ s hands .
above all , we must not equ@@ ate liberal democracy with the status quo , which all but en@@ sures slow , ardu@@ ous decision-making .
if the eu suddenly were to make collective decisions by simple majority , the problems confron@@ ting it would no longer seem intra@@ ctable .
europe would finally be able to stand on its own and address its citizens ’ concerns .
for example , with a european army serving as an autonomous pill@@ ar within nato , the eu would no longer have to de@@ fer to the us on security decisions .
with a single european digital market , european alternatives to google , facebook , amazon , sam@@ sung , and hu@@ a@@ we@@ i could finally emerge .
and with a european border pat@@ ro@@ l and coast guard , europeans would be far less reli@@ ant on turkey , russia , and others when it comes to managing migration flows .
of course , controlling our borders does not mean closing ourselves off from the outside world .
europe will always need to engage with other powers .
but it must do so from a position of strength .
if the eu can rediscover its democratic potential , the al@@ t-@@ right will no longer have grounds on which to launch attacks against international cooperation and multi@@ lat@@ er@@ alism .
in a more democratic europe , citizens who took to the streets would do so not to sc@@ ape@@ goat migr@@ ants and journalists , but to demand solutions for the real challenges we face .
before it was co-@@ op@@ ted , the yellow v@@ est movement was based on a genuine concern about economic security .
the lesson for all eu member states is that we must shore up our national soci@@ al-@@ security systems , while moving forward on eu@@ -@@ level reforms .
with a full-@@ fle@@ dged banking union , citizens ’ savings would be secu@@ red , and taxpa@@ yers would not end up on the hook for privat@@ e-@@ sector pro@@ fli@@ g@@ acy .
and with a complete mon@@ etary union and an autonomous joint budget , the euro@@ zone would be far more resilient in the event of another financial crisis .
until europe gets serious about economic reforms , our economy will continue to under@@ perform struc@@ turally vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis the rest of the world .
since 2010 , the average annual growth rate in the euro area has been 1.3 % , compared to 2.@@ 3 % in the united states .
this gap represents € 1.2 trillion ( $ 1.@@ 4 trillion ) from 20@@ 10-@@ 20@@ 18 , or approximately € 500 billion lost in terms of tax revenue .
for france alone , this amounts to € 10 billion every year – the bud@@ ge@@ tary cost of what ma@@ cr@@ on recently proposed to meet the yellow v@@ ests ’ original demands .
the u@@ prising that europe needs will not happen in the streets of paris or brus@@ sels , but within the eu ’ s paralyzed institutions .
for more than five decades , power within europe has been divided between conservatives and soci@@ alists who , collectively , have failed to address the challenges of the day .
it is time to leave the european talking shop behind us .
the current era demands action .
in the may 20@@ 19 european parliament election , “ generation europe ” can break the old political order and take the revolution out of the streets and into the hall@@ ways of european democracy .
will the yellow v@@ ests reject the brown shirts ?
paris – from the moment the french government can@@ cel@@ ed its planned fuel tax hi@@ ke in the face of massive prote@@ sts , it was obvious that the move would be perceived as inadequate , in@@ significant , and above all in@@ capable of having any cal@@ ming effect .
honor to whom honor is due : the yellow v@@ ests claim to be an expression of the sovereig@@ n people .
but they now bear a heavy responsibility .
for star@@ ters , they must announce a mor@@ at@@ orium on demon@@ strations and block@@ ades for a period long enough to accommo@@ date the dialogue proposed by prime minister é@@ dou@@ ard philippe , if not longer .
in particular , they should ren@@ ounce the mu@@ ch-@@ tou@@ ted december 8 “ act iv ” of the movement , bre@@ wing on facebook since saturday evening , which everyone expe@@ cts to be more violent , destructive , and tragic than the prece@@ ding inst@@ all@@ ments .
there have been enough deaths , injuries , and damage ( including to some of the most famous monum@@ ents in paris ) .
if the yellow v@@ ests decide the machine they have unle@@ ashed has over@@ taken them , and they can no longer stop act iv , they must be prepared during the prote@@ sts to help the police flush out the violent “ brown v@@ ests ” who will be circul@@ ating among them .
because the wre@@ ckers of the far right and far left will surely re@@ appear to v@@ and@@ alize , terrori@@ ze , and des@@ ec@@ rate ; it is up to the yellow v@@ ests to say once again , this time as if they really mean it : not in our name .
whether the yellow v@@ ests de@@ clare a mor@@ at@@ orium or continue to protest , nothing would serve their cause better than to dis@@ soci@@ ate themselves – decisi@@ vely and un@@ ambigu@@ ously – from all the political profit@@ e@@ ers who would capit@@ alize on their misery .
the cast of opport@@ uni@@ sts is well known .
here is jean-@@ lu@@ c m@@ é@@ len@@ ch@@ on , who , having finished fourth in the 20@@ 17 presidential election won by emmanuel ma@@ cr@@ on , is desperately seeking a new following .
there is fran@@ ç@@ ois ru@@ ff@@ in , the leader of the anti-@@ au@@ ster@@ ity movement nu@@ it deb@@ out , with his ir@@ responsible anti-@@ republican calls of “ res@@ ign , ma@@ cr@@ on ! ” and over there is marine le pen , osc@@ ill@@ ating com@@ ically between taking pride in and rep@@ enting her call to occupy the cham@@ ps é@@ ly@@ s@@ é@@ es last saturday , thereby becoming accountable for the worst of what was said and done there .
and there the intellec@@ tu@@ als who , in the manner of lu@@ c fer@@ ry and emmanuel todd , suggest that it was perhaps not “ by chance ” that the wre@@ ckers had such an easy time approaching , stor@@ ming , and sac@@ king the arc de tri@@ om@@ p@@ he .
such rhetoric lays the worst of all tra@@ ps for a popular movement : the trap of con@@ spir@@ atori@@ al thinking .
in other words , the yellow v@@ ests are at a cross@@ roads .
either they will be bold enough to stop and take the time they need to get organized , following a path not unlike that of ma@@ cr@@ on ’ s own la r@@ é@@ publi@@ que en mar@@ che ! , which , in hin@@ d@@ sight , might appear to be the yellow v@@ ests ’ first-@@ to-@@ arrive twin .
ma@@ cr@@ on ’ s movement , too , had right and left wings .
and it knew that it was a new political body , engaging in a dialogue or even a show@@ down that would lead to an honest reck@@ oning with poverty and the high cost of living .
if the yellow v@@ ests build a movement that rises to the height of ma@@ cr@@ on ’ s , it may end up writing a page in the history of france .
or the yellow v@@ ests may turn out to lack that bol@@ dness and settle for the pal@@ try pleasure of being seen on television .
they will allow themselves to become in@@ to@@ xic@@ ated by the sight of l@@ umin@@ aries and experts of la france d ’ en haut ( elite france ) seem@@ ing to eat from their hands and hanging on their every word .
but if the yellow v@@ ests allow passionate hate to win out over genuine fr@@ ater@@ nity and choose wre@@ cking over re@@ forming , they will bring only chaos , not improvement , to the lives of humble and vulnerable people .
they will care@@ en off into the dark@@ est side of the political night , and end up in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , where they can ru@@ b el@@ bows with those other yel@@ lows , the ear@@ ly-@@ twen@@ ti@@ eth@@ -@@ century “ yellow soci@@ alists ” of the pro@@ to-@@ fas@@ cist syn@@ di@@ cal@@ ist pierre bi@@ é@@ try .
the yellow v@@ ests must choose : democratic re-@@ invention , or an updated version of the national soci@@ alist lea@@ gues ; a will to repair , or the urge to destroy .
the decision will hin@@ ge on the historic essence of the movement – whether its refle@@ xes are good or bad , and whether , in the final analysis , it poss@@ esses political and moral courage .
they have the initiative as much as ma@@ cr@@ on does .
will they say , “ yes , we believe in republican democracy ? ”
and will they say it loud and clear , without equi@@ voc@@ ation ?
or will they place themselves in the tradition of paran@@ oid ni@@ hi@@ li@@ sm and poll@@ ute their ran@@ ks with the political v@@ and@@ als that france still produces in abundance ?
paris – are the yellow v@@ est prote@@ sts across france as con@@ sequ@@ ential as the mass r@@ allies of may 1968 ?
the revol@@ t has forced french president emmanuel ma@@ cr@@ on to make significant and costly conc@@ essions , but it is hardly a new french revolution .
though some demon@@ strat@@ ors clearly want to re@@ en@@ act the “ fe@@ ats ” of their ancestors against their ( elected ) mon@@ arch , we are not in july 17@@ 89 .
the u@@ prising of may 1968 , it is worth rec@@ alling , was driven largely by a bored generation of students living at the peak of france ’ s post-@@ war prosperity .
though the economy was at full employment , they reb@@ elled against the status quo in the name of du@@ bi@@ ous utop@@ i@@ as inspired by fi@@ del ca@@ stro ’ s cuba and mao ’ s china .
they were joined by well-@@ organized trade uni@@ ons that helped the movement reach a critical mass , at least tempor@@ arily .
the difference between then and now is that those taking to the streets to protest against ma@@ cr@@ on ’ s proposed fu@@ el-@@ tax increase are animated not by utopia but by despair .
in this sense , the yellow v@@ est u@@ prising is not unlike a french bre@@ x@@ it , in that it amounts to an act of shooting ones@@ elf in the foot .
whereas the british res@@ or@@ ted to the bal@@ lot box , the french have adopted a mixture of barri@@ ca@@ des , mar@@ ches , and stone throwing .
in either case , everyone seems to lose out .
just as great britain ’ s break from the european union will leave both parties dimin@@ ished , france ’ s domestic up@@ hea@@ val could under@@ cut european integration .
under ma@@ cr@@ on , france was supposed to keep the fl@@ ame of liberal democracy alive in a world dar@@ kened by don@@ ald trum@@ p ’ s america , vi@@ ktor orb@@ án ’ s hung@@ ary , and mat@@ te@@ o sal@@ vin@@ i ’ s italy .
with german chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a mer@@ kel ’ s own leadership sli@@ pping , france looked like an island of hope in a sea of western despair .
that is clearly no longer the case .
one senses in british and american media coverage of the yellow v@@ est prote@@ sts a degree of scha@@ den@@ freude .
the proud nation with the arrogant leader has been knocked down a peg ; it turns out that the french are no different from anyone else .
the yellow v@@ est revol@@ t has been driven in part by ma@@ cr@@ on ’ s mistakes .
in pursuing radical but necessary reforms , he has been counting on stronger economic growth to v@@ indicate him .
but growth has not materi@@ alized , and that makes an ecolo@@ gically motivated fuel tax impossible for midd@@ le@@ - and lower@@ -@@ class french commu@@ ters to accept .
making matters worse , ma@@ cr@@ on launched his reform agenda by slas@@ hing france ’ s wealth tax , a move that won him the so@@ bri@@ qu@@ et “ president of the rich . ”
yet , because ma@@ cr@@ on had cut himself off from the country ’ s “ corps inter@@ m@@ é@@ di@@ aires ” – including may@@ ors , regional representatives , and trade uni@@ ons – it took him far too long to see that the anger in france ’ s provin@@ ces , small towns , and rural areas was coming to a boil .
by surrounding himself with a court of bright young techno@@ crats , ma@@ cr@@ on lost contact with what he calls “ his people ” ( a rather ton@@ e-@@ deaf formu@@ lation in itself ) .
this is a long@@ standing problem with the french merito@@ cracy .
when i was teaching at the national school of administration in the 1980s , i saw the “ happy few ” who had passed the school ’ s highly selective entry exam@@ s being awar@@ ded their own cars and personal drivers .
imagine receiving this treatment as a 20@@ -year-old inter@@ n in one of france ’ s pre@@ fe@@ c@@ tures .
no wonder they operate as if the state is at their service , rather than the other way around .
ma@@ cr@@ on ’ s own personality may also have been a decisi@@ ve factor in this first major crisis of his pres@@ iden@@ cy .
ma@@ cr@@ on is an excep@@ tionally intelligent , energetic , and courageous person , but he seems to lack the ma@@ turi@@ ty and humility that come with age .
he was so eager to restore to the french pres@@ iden@@ cy the dignity that had been lost under his two pre@@ de@@ cess@@ ors – ni@@ col@@ as sar@@ ko@@ zy and fran@@ ç@@ ois holl@@ an@@ de – that he went too far in the opposite direction .
if you want to impress russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin or other foreign dig@@ ni@@ tar@@ ies , ho@@ sting them in such a magi@@ steri@@ al setting as versa@@ il@@ les is sure to prove effective .
but revel@@ ing in the country ’ s mon@@ arch@@ ical history can be dangerous .
many of those who voted for ma@@ cr@@ on may have been hoping for a twenty-@@ first-@@ century bon@@ apar@@ te .
but now they may be thinking more of louis x@@ vi , the king who paid with his life for the faul@@ ts of his pre@@ de@@ cess@@ ors .
can ma@@ cr@@ on learn from his mistakes and regain the confidence of french voters who have felt humili@@ ated by him ?
it will not be easy , but it is not impossible .
at any rate , one should not write off pre@@ ma@@ tur@@ ely a politician of such vision and ambition .
rather than re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing in a bold leader ’ s com@@ eu@@ pp@@ ance , those who still believe in democracy should be thinking about what it would mean if ma@@ cr@@ on fails .
italy ’ s present would become france ’ s future , and the popu@@ lists who come to power in paris would probably put an end to the entire european project .
that is not an outcome anyone should wish for .
for better or worse , ma@@ cr@@ on still represents european democracy ’ s best bul@@ war@@ k against a wave of popu@@ list nation@@ alism .
yel@@ ts@@ in &apos;s last surprise
moscow : the hardest thing about power is knowing when to let go .
the next hardest , particularly in a country like russia which has experienced nothing but dictator@@ ship for a millennium , is knowing whom to hand over power to .
in announcing his res@@ ig@@ nation on december 31 bor@@ is yel@@ ts@@ in may have succeeded on both counts , as@@ suring not only his personal safety , but his place in history and russia &apos;s infant democracy .
yel@@ ts@@ in was more than the man who saved russia in 1991 when a coup by communist hard-@@ lin@@ ers threatened to turn back the clock by nu@@ lli@@ fying mik@@ ha@@ il gor@@ bach@@ e@@ v &apos;s per@@ estro@@ i@@ ka and glas@@ no@@ st .
in nine mu@@ ddy years since then yel@@ ts@@ in also created a new russia , very much in his own image : one unpredictable , way@@ ward , but full of promise .
by stepping down now , yel@@ ts@@ in has given his hand@@ picked success@@ or , acting president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin , the best chance to win elections that will take place this coming march .
sha@@ des of kre@@ m@@ lin ts@@ ars and com@@ miss@@ ars of old ? as a de@@ ft man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ r@@ er of the old school of communist politics , the gi@@ be is temp@@ ting to apply to yel@@ ts@@ in .
it is also unfair . with mand@@ atory presidential elections next year , moscow was a@@ wash in rum@@ ours : “ feeding time at the zoo ” as one british prime minister called it .
by ending the whisper@@ ing campaign that he intended to cling to power no matter what , president yel@@ ts@@ in deserves more che@@ ers than je@@ ers .
through this or@@ derly and constit@@ ution@@ ally correct device to attempt to assure his succ@@ ession , yel@@ ts@@ in may have put paid to any possibility of a chaotic power struggle in the kre@@ m@@ lin without sacrifi@@ cing democratic principles .
russia may now go on to complete its transition from communism to capitalism .
but what do we know of the hei@@ r apparent , v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin ?
in keeping with his sha@@ dow@@ y k@@ gb background , very little .
pu@@ tin is a married 46 year old , and a graduate of saint peter@@ sburg university &apos;s law faculty .
sta@@ tioned for a decade as a k@@ gb agent in the former east germany , he saw western democratic and business practices at close hand , and is believed to be committed to them .
after communism &apos;s collapse , he worked with people like an@@ ot@@ ol@@ y chu@@ ba@@ is in the liberal st. peter@@ sburg government of the early 1990s .
transferred to moscow , he headed the fs@@ b ( the transformed k@@ gb ) until yel@@ ts@@ in suddenly ap@@ pointed him prime minister last august .
despite his mur@@ ky profile , pu@@ tin &apos;s most potent claim to fame – and to power – is a d@@ our toug@@ hness .
in the bloody mountains and ruined cities of che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya , pu@@ tin established his cre@@ denti@@ als as the hard man russia needs to restore order and stop the country &apos;s internal dis@@ integration by revi@@ tali@@ zing state power .
with western economic policy prescri@@ ptions widely seen as having failed in russia ; with nato expanding near to the country &apos;s borders and old allies like ser@@ bia bom@@ bed ; with america seen as wanting to wea@@ ken russia even more , breaking it up into pieces and controlling the o@@ il-@@ rich cas@@ pi@@ an basin , anti-@@ western senti@@ ments are on the rise .
president pu@@ tin &apos;s keen political antenna has caught this trend .
so the fact that the west eyes russia &apos;s acting president with suspi@@ cion makes him even more des@@ ir@@ able to the traditional russian heart .
v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin , however , pre@@ fers to promote the impression of his being a more enlightened and modern leader .
his prime ministeri@@ al new year &apos;s address – &quot; russia at the turn of the millennium &quot; -- was posted on a russian government website for all the world to see before being published in russian newspapers .
in it he out@@ lined his presidential program : playing to the crowds , he declared that russia is no play@@ thing for the west to kick around .
but de@@ ma@@ go@@ gu@@ ery stopped there . russia , he also declared , must mend itself .
it will remain cooperative and friendly with the world , provided that the world is cooperative and friendly too .
but the hard work of rebuilding russia must be done by russians , and with no time to waste .
in russia cultural instincts , in which communal ideas remain more valued than individu@@ alist principles , help determine the success or failure of policies .
the national strategies pu@@ tin will likely follow will take into account these social impulses .
thus he is unlikely to publicly trum@@ pet the un@@ for@@ giving capit@@ alist policies of ga@@ i@@ dar and chu@@ ba@@ is , even if he quietly pursu@@ es them .
und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly a strong patriot , pu@@ tin also knows that russia &apos;s national idea of itself must be cle@@ ans@@ ed of hau@@ gh@@ tin@@ ess and imperial ambi@@ tions .
time and again he has said that russia &apos;s national idea must blend traditional russian concepts with a new , modern content .
the russia he en@@ visions will be a great power once more , but great in the ways that a truly modern society must be : in its democratic commit@@ ments , its economy , and its domestic tran@@ qu@@ illi@@ ty .
the consensus in russia today is that pu@@ tin is a man of neither great talents nor great vices .
to ordinary russians he appears as modest , princi@@ pled , and honest – a vast contrast with the tain@@ ted politicians of the yel@@ ts@@ in years .
he is a perfect fit for a russia grown tired of the heroes , revolution@@ aries , criminals – even sa@@ vi@@ ours – who make life exciting but rarely stable .
a recent poll showed that what russia most wants is a new bre@@ z@@ hne@@ v , whose 20 years ( 196@@ 4-@@ 1982 ) of leadership first were dis@@ da@@ ined as an &quot; era of stag@@ nation , &quot; but are now nostal@@ gically rec@@ alled as the &quot; golden era of stag@@ nation . &quot;
pu@@ tin fits the des@@ ired m@@ ould for a firm@@ ness and sto@@ li@@ dity that en@@ sures stability , a strong state , and a &quot; golden middle &quot; between radical reforms and stron@@ g-@@ arm rule .
in the back of their minds , however , russians also hold a secret fear about pu@@ tin .
it concerns a man , a pleasant quiet individual who walks sound@@ lessly through the kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s corrid@@ ors , someone who un@@ compla@@ in@@ ingly takes on ( and comple@@ tes ) many hard and un@@ pleasant tasks negle@@ cted by others who fight no@@ isi@@ ly for high position .
russians know that , one day , these un@@ assuming political bea@@ sts of burden suddenly come out on top , as stalin did in the early 19@@ 20s .
so of president pu@@ tin russia , like history , must still reserve its jud@@ gement .
did us dr@@ one strikes lose yemen ?
new york – recent revel@@ ations that the us killed an innocent american in a dr@@ one strike in pakistan confirm what a new study , “ death by dr@@ one , ” of civilian harm caused by us dr@@ one strikes in yemen shows – that claims about the precision of dr@@ one strikes are over@@ stated .
the revel@@ ations also under@@ score the stark asym@@ me@@ try between how the us tre@@ ats dr@@ one strikes that kill its own citizens and those that kill others . while the obama administration has now publicly acknowled@@ ged that it has recently killed three us citizens in dr@@ one strikes , it has refused to acknowledge countless other dr@@ one strikes around the world which have killed non-@@ us civili@@ ans .
in yemen , the us has been conducting dr@@ one strikes since at least 2002 , with estimates of the total number of strikes ranging from 91 to 20@@ 3 .
while the american and yemen@@ i governments have lau@@ ded the dr@@ ones ’ precise targe@@ ting , they have refused to meaning@@ fully dis@@ close key details about the strikes , including how many have been conducted , who has been targeted , or , cru@@ cially , the number and identities of civili@@ ans killed .
in a may 2013 speech at the national defense university , obama offered as@@ sur@@ ances that , outside the afghan war theater , no dr@@ one strike would be carried out unless there was “ near-@@ certainty that no civili@@ ans will be killed or injured . ”
obama also cla@@ imed that the us targets only “ terrorists who pose a continuing and im@@ min@@ ent threat to the american people , ” and that it does not launch dr@@ one strikes when it has “ the ability to capture individual terrorists . ”
“ death by dr@@ one , ” which includes first-@@ hand testimony from eye@@ witn@@ esses and survivors of dr@@ one strikes in yemen , tells a different story .
the nine case studies documented in the report , four of which cover attacks that came after the 2013 speech , provide credible evidence that us dr@@ one strikes have killed and injured yemen@@ i civili@@ ans , suggesting that the “ near-@@ certainty ” standard is not being effectively implemented .
the report also ca@@ sts doubt on obama ’ s other claims , with evidence indic@@ ating that targets of dr@@ one strikes , though perhaps posing a threat to yemen , may not have posed a direct threat to the us , and that their capture may have been possible .
in other words , yemen@@ i civili@@ ans have suffered and died from dr@@ one strikes that may not have been necessary .
more generally , the report provides a window into the experiences of yemen@@ i civili@@ ans directly affected by us dr@@ one strikes .
the testim@@ onies of these individuals , vital for ass@@ essing the us dr@@ one program , are all too easy to over@@ look because these individuals are poor and have no political influence , and because the strikes are conducted in secret , far away from the us .
as y@@ as@@ lem sa@@ e@@ ed bin is@@ ha@@ q , whose son was killed in a us dr@@ one strike in wa@@ di sir on august 1 , 2013 , observed , “ they just kill .
they do not know what ha@@ vo@@ c their missi@@ les have caused . they are unaware of the suffering they create for our families . ”
indeed , if the us never acknowled@@ ges the specific strikes , how can ordinary americans possibly know that ras@@ il@@ ah al-@@ fa@@ q@@ i@@ h , a pregnant yemen@@ i woman , was killed in wal@@ ad rab@@ ei ’ , along with her husband and ten@@ -year-old daughter , as they headed home from a visit to the doctor ?
in every incident recorded in this report , the families of yemen@@ i civili@@ ans killed in us strikes want to know why they were targeted .
as the father of nas@@ ser mohammed nas@@ ser , one of four innocent civili@@ ans killed in a us dr@@ one strike on april 19 , 20@@ 14 , lam@@ ented : “ my son and those who were with him had nothing to do with al qaeda . they were simply on their way to earn a living .
in february 2013 , th@@ en-@@ white house counter@@ terrorism chief john brenn@@ an te@@ sti@@ fied at his senate confir@@ mation hearing to become cia director that , “ in the interest of transparency , ” the us must acknowledge mista@@ ken kill@@ ings publicly .
it should come as no surprise , then , that civili@@ ans like nas@@ ser , who have lost mothers , fathers , sons , and daughters in us strikes , are ou@@ tra@@ ged not only at the us , but also at the yemen@@ i government , which con@@ s@@ ented to the attacks .
they believe that instead of making yemen and the us safer , dr@@ one strikes only streng@@ then support for al qaeda .
can yemen be saved ?
san@@ a &apos;@@ a – yemen is no stranger to crisis .
exposed to a regional pro@@ xy war between iran and saudi arabia , pla@@ gu@@ ed by an ent@@ ren@@ ched al qaeda aff@@ ili@@ ate , and divided by tribal dispu@@ tes and a sec@@ ession movement , the country has become a poster child for everything that can go wrong in the arab world .
yemen has demonstrated remarkable resili@@ ency in the past .
to ensure that the recent over@@ throw of its government by the shi@@ a hou@@ th@@ i rebel movement does not deal yemen the lethal blow that it has avoi@@ ded so far , the international community must not abandon the country in what may be its hour of greatest need .
the origins of the hou@@ th@@ i movement date to 1991 , when it was created to protect za@@ y@@ dis@@ m , a moder@@ ate form of shi &apos;@@ ism , from the en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ment of sun@@ ni islam@@ ists .
after the attacks on new york and washington , dc , on september 11 , 2001 , the group &apos;s battle took on a geo@@ political dimension , as its fighters obje@@ cted to yemen &apos;s decision to collaborate with the united states and enhance bil@@ ateral intelligence cooperation .
from 2004 to 2010 , the group fought six wars against the yemen@@ i government and even skir@@ mis@@ hed with saudi arabia .
yet it never managed to expand its reach beyond its stron@@ gh@@ old in the north of the country .
that changed in 2011 , when the popular prote@@ sts and political chaos ste@@ mming from the arab spring led to widespread institutional paralysis , allowing the hou@@ this to march past a military that largely refused to fight it .
the group &apos;s power grab has frightened its adver@@ sar@@ ies , leading them to seek new alli@@ ances that could imper@@ il the state &apos;s security .
in the central region of mari@@ b , home to the oil and gas facilities that yemen reli@@ es on for foreign currency , several tribes have vo@@ wed to fight the hou@@ this .
the region was once a stron@@ gh@@ old of al qaeda in the arab@@ ian pen@@ insu@@ la ( a@@ q@@ ap ) , an aff@@ ili@@ ate of the global terrorist organization .
if the military ref@@ uses to ass@@ ist the tribes – as is likely – they may be temp@@ ted to turn to a@@ q@@ ap .
the situation is no less pre@@ car@@ i@@ ous in the southern provin@@ ces , where a sec@@ ession movement has been active since 2007 .
south@@ ern@@ ers are up in arms because the hou@@ th@@ i rebellion hal@@ ted plans for the adoption of a federal system , which would have given the region greater autonomy .
in response , armed groups sei@@ zed check@@ points and closed the port of aden .
the risk of sec@@ ession is very real .
southern sun@@ nis have been margin@@ alized since a 1994 civil war that left nor@@ th@@ ern@@ ers in control of most of the country &apos;s political institutions .
many in the region worry that the hou@@ this will discrimin@@ ate against them further .
a@@ q@@ ap is firmly rooted in this region as well , im@@ plying the possibility that local residents will seek its help in defending against an expected hou@@ th@@ i ons@@ lau@@ ght .
meanwhile , yemen continues to serve as a battle@@ ground in a pro@@ xy war between iran and saudi arabia .
iran has armed and trained the hou@@ this , and , though the rebel@@ s &apos; brand of shi &apos;@@ ism shares little with that practiced in tehran , they have pra@@ ised the islamic republic &apos;s founder , ay@@ at@@ ol@@ la@@ h ru@@ hol@@ la@@ h k@@ hom@@ ein@@ i , and held up iran &apos;s le@@ ban@@ ese pro@@ xy , he@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h , as a model to be em@@ ulated .
when the hou@@ this took over san@@ a &apos;@@ a , the capital , in september , saudi arabia cut off aid to the country .
decreased ear@@ nings led yemen to forecast a $ 3.@@ 2 billion budget deficit last year .
if the tur@@ mo@@ il is not cur@@ ta@@ iled and the sau@@ dis do not res@@ u@@ me the payments that have long en@@ su@@ red the country &apos;s ability to function , yemen may not be able to cover its expen@@ di@@ tures .
the us has followed saudi arabia &apos;s lead , shu@@ tter@@ ing its embassy and freezing intelligence cooperation and counter@@ terrorism operations .
this is a mistake .
yemen &apos;s military is largely intact , having remained in its bar@@ ra@@ cks as the hou@@ this mar@@ ched to the capital , and there is little evidence that the units that work with the americans are lo@@ yal to the new rebel government .
suspen@@ ding cooperation risks giving a@@ q@@ ap free rein in a country where it was able to wre@@ ak ha@@ vo@@ c even when brid@@ led .
yemen is mi@@ red in crises that it cannot solve alone .
unless its international allies throw it a lifel@@ ine , it risks being swallowed by a sea of disorder that could imper@@ il the entire region .
yemen ’ s regime change gets personal
san@@ aa – when yemen ’ s president ali ab@@ dul@@ la@@ h sal@@ eh ordered his military on march 18 to fire on peaceful prote@@ sters calling for his res@@ ig@@ nation , he sealed his fate .
a wave of military , government , and diplo@@ matic defe@@ ctions , led by his long-@@ time ally first ar@@ mor@@ ed briga@@ de commander general ali mu@@ h@@ sin al-@@ ah@@ mar , ro@@ cked his regime .
but , although al-@@ ah@@ mar announced that he was app@@ alled by the use of force and vo@@ wed to defend the constitution , his decision was anything but altru@@ istic .
the dis@@ grun@@ tled general , who has long-@@ standing ties to the type of ji@@ ha@@ di@@ sts that the united states is bat@@ tling in yemen , merely sought to settle a score with the president ’ s family .
the relationship between al-@@ ah@@ mar and sal@@ eh exten@@ ds to their youth , with sal@@ eh ’ s mother having had a second marriage to al-@@ ah@@ mar ’ s uncle .
though they are not half-@@ brothers , this frequent , if mista@@ ken reference , indicates their clo@@ sen@@ ess .
al-@@ ah@@ mar has long been considered either sal@@ eh ’ s right hand man or the country ’ s hidden president . when the nas@@ seri@@ te party attempted to over@@ throw sal@@ eh less than 100 days into his pres@@ iden@@ cy , al-@@ ah@@ mar defen@@ ded him and qu@@ ashed the coup .
in 1994 , his units put down a sec@@ essi@@ onist movement in the south .
but , as sal@@ eh prepared the way for his son ah@@ mad – the head of the presidential guard – to succeed him , he began to margin@@ alize al-@@ ah@@ mar .
in 2009 , sal@@ eh sac@@ ked al-@@ ah@@ mar ’ s key back@@ ers , including central command chief general al-@@ tha@@ hir@@ i al-@@ sha@@ da@@ di and lie@@ u@@ ten@@ ant general hay@@ dar al-@@ san@@ han@@ i , from power .
al-@@ ah@@ mar has also not benef@@ ited from the military aid that the us la@@ vis@@ hed on yemen in the wake of al-qaeda ’ s failed christmas day plot in 2009 to down an american air@@ lin@@ er .
while the central security service , led by sal@@ eh ’ s ne@@ phe@@ w ya@@ hy@@ a , has received millions of dollars to fight al-qaeda in the arab@@ ian pen@@ insu@@ la , al-@@ ah@@ mar has been left out of the economic bon@@ an@@ za .
at the same time , al-@@ ah@@ mar ’ s dis@@ mal performance in spe@@ ar@@ heading the war against the hou@@ thi@@ -@@ led sec@@ tarian rebellion in the north made him a convenient sc@@ ape@@ goat for the regime ’ s failures .
the regime ’ s desire to get al-@@ ah@@ mar out of the picture became clear during the last round of fighting ag@@ inst the hou@@ this in 200@@ 9@@ -@@ 2010 , when saudi arabia began bom@@ bing the rebel@@ s .
according to a us diplo@@ matic cable released by wikileaks , yemen@@ i officials gave the sau@@ dis the coordin@@ ates for al-@@ ah@@ mar ’ s command center , telling them that it was a hou@@ th@@ i camp .
his relationship with sal@@ eh fra@@ yed and his influence wan@@ ing , al-@@ ah@@ mar understood that his loyalty to sal@@ eh had become a li@@ ability .
so his decision to abandon sal@@ eh ste@@ mmed less from his love of the constitution and democracy than from his desire to even the score with the president and his son ah@@ mad sal@@ eh , with whom he has long clas@@ hed .
their units skir@@ mis@@ hed during the hou@@ th@@ i campaign , and the two engaged in a power struggle over defense of the radio and television stations .
sal@@ eh won at the time , but today al-@@ ah@@ mar ’ s troops have control .
al-@@ ah@@ mar ’ s relationship with ji@@ ha@@ di@@ sts is a source of serious concern .
he is married to the sister of tari@@ q al-@@ fa@@ d@@ hl@@ i , a yemen@@ i who fought alongside al-qaeda leader osama bin la@@ din in afghanistan .
when more than 4,000 arab@@ s returned from fighting the so@@ vie@@ ts there , al-@@ ah@@ mar organized them into units and deployed them in the 1994 civil war .
one ji@@ ha@@ d@@ ist who trained in al-qaeda ’ s camps , and met bin la@@ din , told me that upon his return from afghanistan , he was invited to meet al-@@ ah@@ mar ’ s associ@@ ates and was given a monthly sti@@ p@@ end .
during a 1999 trial of yemen@@ is convicted of kidna@@ pping 16 europeans , it emerged that the group ’ s ring@@ leader called al-@@ ah@@ mar during the or@@ deal .
though his ties to ji@@ ha@@ di@@ sts may be expe@@ dient rather than ideological , they are deeply worrying .
today , sal@@ eh ’ s support among his top gener@@ als is d@@ wind@@ ling .
of yemen ’ s four regional comman@@ ders , only southern command chief general ma@@ h@@ di ma@@ q@@ wal@@ a still backs him .
lesser lie@@ u@@ ten@@ ant gener@@ als have deser@@ ted the president in dro@@ ves .
the fate of the country may not hin@@ ge on sal@@ eh , a cra@@ fty veteran who knows that his career is over .
but his son ah@@ mad , who is less politically ast@@ ute , may yet seek to settle accounts with al-@@ ah@@ mar .
his forces have already clas@@ hed with ri@@ val units in mu@@ k@@ all@@ a and surrounded the presidential palace in aden .
if the sal@@ e@@ hs retain control of the air force , which remains under the control of sal@@ eh ’ s half-@@ brother , emplo@@ ying it against defe@@ cting military di@@ visions would likely lead to a blood@@ bath .
nevertheless , the do@@ om@@ s@@ day scenarios predicting an@@ archy and chaos in the post-@@ sal@@ eh era are most likely exagger@@ ated .
unlike in egypt , the vacuum resul@@ ting from sal@@ eh ’ s de@@ par@@ ture can be quickly filled , so the country need not fall back on a military oli@@ g@@ archy .
the yemen@@ i opposition is not only organized , but also plays an active role in politics and has true grassroots support .
and , unlike in egypt , where the rul@@ ing party was dete@@ sted and out of touch with the masses , yemen ’ s general people ’ s congress has some following in society .
if sal@@ eh leaves peac@@ efully and repres@@ ses the urge to unle@@ ash the last remaining lo@@ yal army units against prote@@ sters and defe@@ cting soldiers , the country can aver@@ t liby@@ a-@@ like may@@ hem .
indeed , the opposition parties have already organized a transi@@ tional council to take sal@@ eh ’ s place .
with the sun quickly setting on the sal@@ eh era , the president is out of options .
women ’ s development goals
new york – as the 2015 deadline for the united nations millennium development goals ( m@@ d@@ gs ) approaches , world leaders will face a choice : move the goal posts back another decade or two , or hold accountable those who have failed to deliver on their commit@@ ments .
for women , the choice is clear .
we have been here before .
in 1978 , at the international conference on primary health care in al@@ ma-@@ ata , 13@@ 4 states signed a declar@@ ation calling for adequate health care for all by the year 2000 .
six@@ teen years later , in 1994 , in cairo , 17@@ 9 governments embraced reproductive rights as a basic human right and adopted resol@@ u@@ tions to ensure the pro@@ vision of universal access to a full range of reproductive health services , including family planning .
yet those dead@@ lines had come and gone when , in september 2000 , during the 5@@ 5@@ th un general assembly , leaders of 18@@ 9 nations adopted the m@@ d@@ gs .
and several other commit@@ ments and resol@@ u@@ tions were under@@ taken by world leaders before and after the m@@ dg declar@@ ation .
so , where are we now ?
we know that several m@@ dg targets have already been met . extreme poverty has been more than hal@@ ved since 2000 , to about 22 % in 2010 – taking almost 700 million people out of the ran@@ ks of the world ’ s poorest .
we have seen positive results in the fight against hiv / aids , malaria , and tuberculosis .
billions of people have access to improved drinking water ; and many have gained access to sanitation ( though a billion people still have to resort to open defe@@ cation – a major health risk ) .
there has also been progress on gender equality .
girls and boys attend school in equal numbers , and women are increasingly making themselves heard in the political arena .
but the picture quickly becomes clou@@ dy .
though chronic under-@@ nutrition among young children has declined , one in four children – 16@@ 2 million children , according to the world health organization – are still affected by stun@@ ting .
indeed , maternal and child mortality has decreased by millions , but many of these preventable deaths are still cla@@ iming the lives of hundreds of thousands of women and children each year .
moreover , the un foundation reports that 2@@ 22 million women still cannot access the most basic information , products , and services that would enable them to decide how many children to have and to time their preg@@ nan@@ cies in ways that preserve their health , enable them to pursue an education , and improve their lives .
the same report notes that more than 300,000 girls and women aged 15-@@ 19 die every year from preg@@ nan@@ cy@@ -@@ related compli@@ cations , while many more are left to deal with de@@ bili@@ tating disabilities .
the un secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general ’ s 2013 report “ a life of dignity for all ” calls for a universal agenda to ensure that no one is left behind .
but millions of people – and particularly women – already are being left behind .
and , because world leaders and their development partners have failed to meet women ’ s basic re@@ produ@@ c@@ tiv@@ e-@@ health needs once again , it will be more difficult to achieve concrete progress toward realizing the agenda for sustainable development .
the un ’ s own calls to accelerate momentum at the launch of the 50@@ 0-@@ day coun@@ t@@ down to the m@@ d@@ gs ’ exp@@ ir@@ y highlight the fact that inequality , maternal mortality from child@@ birth , lack of universal education , and environmental degradation remain serious challenges .
to truly affect change – and not only for women – we need global support for access to family planning , women ’ s and children ’ s health services , and support for empowerment initi@@ atives .
an educated woman is better able to take care of herself , make informed choices , and bro@@ aden her contribution to her community .
no one dispu@@ tes that development must be inclusive and equ@@ itable .
what is missing from the diplo@@ matic dis@@ course is a strong framework to hold governments and development partners accountable for translating lo@@ fty ideals like human rights – particularly the right to access basic health and social services – into practical solutions .
as the post-@@ 2015 sustainable development agenda is dra@@ fted , world leaders and their development partners need to think beyond setting new goals or targets that fade with time , and move toward establi@@ shing accountability mechanisms , processes , and systems to ensure that we meet the goals that we have already set .
we must break away from the current un@@ written code of “ zero accountability ” for leaders who fail to honor their own commit@@ ments to internation@@ ally agreed goals .
in short , our governments must begin to do what they have promised .
without strong accountability mechanisms , ending preventable maternal deaths and fo@@ stering sustainable and equ@@ itable development will continue to elu@@ de us as we move into increasingly per@@ il@@ ous times .
can ukra@@ ine be saved ?
k@@ yi@@ v – ac@@ rid black smoke hangs in the air and st@@ ings the eye in much of central k@@ yi@@ v , where state repres@@ sion is dam@@ pen@@ ing hope of resol@@ ving ukra@@ ine ’ s political crisis .
with a tru@@ ce between the government and the opposition shat@@ tered only hours after it came into effect , and with dozens of people reported killed in recent days , any hope for an end to the country ’ s dee@@ pen@@ ing civil disorder appears to be fa@@ ding fast .
yes , a tent@@ ative settlement has been reached , following medi@@ ation by european union foreign ministers , with a promise of early elections .
but such sett@@ lements have been proposed before , and no agreement is likely to gain broad acceptance unless it includes the immediate de@@ par@@ ture of president vi@@ ktor yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch .
in fact , yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch ’ s government seems prepared to use any and all measures to remain in power .
taking a page from russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin ’ s play@@ book , tax police are pro@@ secu@@ ting ci@@ vil@@ -@@ society organizations in the hope of co@@ wing them into silence and ir@@ relevance .
yet , despite such intimi@@ dation , ukra@@ ini@@ ans from all walks of life have been prote@@ sting for three months in cities across the country .
at its heart , this is a struggle between ukra@@ ine ’ s europe@@ an-@@ oriented west and its russi@@ an-@@ fix@@ ated east for the country ’ s geo@@ political soul .
will ukra@@ ine move closer to the european union or instead join the russi@@ an-@@ dominated eur@@ asian union ?
despite the moun@@ ting violence , ukra@@ ine is not on the verge of civil war – at least not yet .
but make no mistake : the risk of the country – and its military – spl@@ inter@@ ing is very real , as yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch ’ s decision to sack vol@@ o@@ dy@@ my@@ r z@@ am@@ ana , the head of the armed forces , at@@ tests .
the conflict needs to be stopped now .
to achieve that , ukra@@ ine needs a transi@@ tional government of experts and a new constitution that returns the country to the system that prevail@@ ed until a decade ago , with power divided between parliament and the president .
moreover , a presidential election should be held within three months , with a new parliament voted in soon after .
but yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch has shown that he does not want a negoti@@ ated solution .
until the recent surge in violence , it seemed that dialogue might def@@ use ten@@ sions .
an am@@ ne@@ sty for deta@@ ined prote@@ sters was offered , and prote@@ sters agreed to with@@ draw from government buildings .
but when demon@@ strat@@ ors fulfilled their promise and ev@@ acu@@ ated occupied buildings , yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch res@@ or@@ ted to force in an effort to end the prote@@ sts altogether .
indeed , the police began firing into crowds of demon@@ strat@@ ors , and have repor@@ tedly killed at least 70 and injured hundreds more .
hospitals are over@@ flowing , and many people are avoiding state clinics , because they are afraid of being deta@@ ined – or worse .
the activist y@@ uri ver@@ bit@@ sky , a mathematical physicist , was ab@@ du@@ cted by five men in late january from a k@@ yi@@ v hospital , where he had gone to seek treatment after being injured by a stu@@ n gren@@ ade at a demonstration .
ver@@ bit@@ sky ’ s bat@@ tered body was found the next day in a forest outside the city .
any prospect for resol@@ ving the crisis ultimately depends on re@@ gaining citizens ’ trust in their police and security forces , which are now viewed by many as an occu@@ p@@ ying force .
to re@@ establish the public ’ s confidence , there can be no im@@ pun@@ ity for those who fired bul@@ lets or gave the orders to fire .
officials ’ exc@@ essive use of force , and the government ’ s reli@@ ance on semi-@@ criminal thu@@ gs ( known as ti@@ tus@@ h@@ ki ) to attack prote@@ sters , must be thorough@@ ly investig@@ ated .
but , even as the ongoing violence makes such an investigation all the more urgent , ukra@@ ine ’ s pro@@ secu@@ tor and courts refuse to act .
that is why it is crucial that a high-@@ level international mission – com@@ prising ci@@ vil@@ -@@ society leaders , the council of europe , and the european union – launch a comprehensive inquiry and pressure ukra@@ ine ’ s government to cooperate .
the eu and the united states have introduced diplo@@ matic san@@ ctions since the latest round of mur@@ der@@ ous violence began .
this should include a travel ban not only on all officials who ordered , over@@ saw , or implemented the cra@@ ck@@ down , but also on yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch ’ s political enab@@ lers : the oli@@ g@@ arch@@ s who are now sitting on the si@@ del@@ ines while spiri@@ ting large sums of money out of the country .
san@@ ctions should be lifted only when a credible investigation into the last three months of violence is per@@ mitted and a techno@@ cratic government is in place ( at which point the eu and its member states should offer concrete economic assistance ) .
prime minister my@@ kol@@ a az@@ aro@@ v res@@ ig@@ ned last month , o@@ sten@@ si@@ bly to make way for such a solution .
but yan@@ u@@ ko@@ v@@ y@@ ch has refused to take the next step , or to commit to constitu@@ tional reforms , which largely explains the prote@@ sters ’ growing frustration – and their determination to press ahead in the face of brutal repres@@ sion .
there is a perception in the west that all of ukra@@ ine ’ s political forces are weak , divided , and corrupt .
and there are growing concerns , often fu@@ eled by sen@@ sa@@ tion@@ alist media coverage , that far-@@ right forces are gaining the upper hand within the opposition camp .
but , though such forces do exist , the vast majority of demon@@ strat@@ ors on the ma@@ i@@ dan@@ s across the country are ordinary people angry about abuse of power , state violence , official im@@ pun@@ ity , and corruption .
for the ven@@ al and vicious elites who have taken control of ukra@@ ine , the real threat is these demon@@ strat@@ ors ’ per@@ sever@@ ance , not the provo@@ cations of a radical fr@@ inge .
indeed , while i refuse to believe that ukra@@ ine ’ s march to civil war is un@@ stopp@@ able , i also know that our citizens will never be sil@@ enced again .
filling the global leadership vacuum
seoul – has the world entered a new era of chaos ?
america ’ s vac@@ ill@@ ating policy toward syria certainly suggests so .
indeed , the bitter legacy of the invasi@@ ons of iraq and afghanistan , followed by the 2008 financial crisis , has made the united states not only reluctant to use its military might , even when “ red lines ” are crossed , but also seemingly un@@ willing to bear any serious burden to maintain its global leadership position .
but , if america is no longer willing to lead , who will take its place ?
china ’ s leaders have demonstrated their lack of interest in active global leadership by open@@ ly reje@@ cting calls to become a “ responsible stake@@ holder ” in the international political and economic systems .
meanwhile , though russia may wish to maintain the illusion that it is a global power , it lately seems interested primarily in th@@ war@@ ting america whenever possible – even when doing so is not in its own long-term interests .
and europe faces too many internal problems to assume any significant leadership role in global affairs .
uns@@ ur@@ pris@@ ingly , this de@@ ar@@ th of leadership has seriously under@@ min@@ ed the effectiveness of international institutions , exem@@ pli@@ fied by the united nations security council ’ s in@@ effec@@ tual response to the syria crisis and the failure of the current round of world trade organization ( w@@ to ) trade negotiations .
this situation resem@@ bles the 19@@ 30 ’ s – a decade when , as the economic historian charles p. kind@@ leber@@ ger argued , a leadership vacuum led to the under-@@ production of global public goods , dee@@ pen@@ ing the great depression .
in these circumstances , the us and china – the only viable candidates for global leadership – must achieve a grand compromise that re@@ conc@@ iles their fundamental interests , in turn enabling them to act in concert to provide and protect global public goods .
only by stabili@@ zing the bil@@ ateral sin@@ o-@@ american relationship can a global system that supports peace and shared prosperity be achieved .
such a compromise should begin with a concer@@ ted effort by the us to enhance china ’ s role in international economic institutions like the international mon@@ etary fund , the world bank , and the w@@ to .
while the appointment of the chinese central banker z@@ hu min as imf de@@ pu@@ ty managing director was a positive step , it has not been followed by other ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ments or steps that would increase china ’ s influence .
moreover , china should be included in the trans@@ -@@ pacific partnership – the pan@@ -@@ asian free-@@ trade area that the us is now negotiating with australia , brun@@ ei dar@@ us@@ sal@@ am , chile , malaysia , new zealand , peru , singapore , and vietnam .
dividing the asi@@ a-@@ pacific region into two economic blo@@ cs – one centered around china and the other around the us – will increase mi@@ str@@ ust and encourage economic friction .
in fact , as former us national security advis@@ er z@@ big@@ nie@@ w br@@ ze@@ zin@@ ski argued at the world peace forum in beijing in june , what the world really needs is a comprehensive economic partnership between the us and china .
but such cooperation will be impossible unless the us recognizes china as an equal partner – and not just rhetor@@ ically .
given that the us re@@ tains a significant military advantage over china , america could support such a partnership without in@@ curr@@ ing significant security risks .
the irony is that military super@@ i@@ ority could wea@@ ken us leaders ’ willingness to make the kinds of conc@@ essions , particularly with regard to security matters , that an equal partnership would require .
but , even then , the needed adju@@ st@@ ments could be made without com@@ promising us security interests .
consider us arms sales to taiwan .
given the degree of chin@@ a-@@ taiwan cooperation nowadays , reducing such sales would be unlikely to en@@ danger taiwan , and doing so would contribute substan@@ tially to confi@@ den@@ ce-@@ building between the us and china .
the question is whether any us president , republican or demo@@ crat , would be willing to risk ali@@ en@@ ating those who still view taiwan through the lens of its conflict with the people ’ s republic .
the qu@@ id quo pro for these changes to us policy would be a commitment by china to respect and defend a set of international norms , principles , and institutions that was created largely without its involvement .
given that china ’ s rapid gdp growth since 1979 would have been impossible without america ’ s efforts to create an open world order , chinese leaders should not consider this too difficult a pill to swallow .
to be sure , china ’ s increasingly asser@@ tive foreign policy since 2009 could indicate that , despite the universal advantages that a sin@@ o-@@ american leadership con@@ domini@@ um would bring , its leaders will remain un@@ willing to commit to en@@ forcing the existing global order .
but the growing sense that this new asser@@ tiveness has back@@ fired , increasing anxiety among china ’ s neighbors and compelling the us to ra@@ mp up its strategic involvement in asia , means that china could probably be convinced to res@@ et its relationship with the us .
the major test here will be whether china is willing to accept the status quo in the east and south china seas .
do@@ om@@ sa@@ yers frequently ci@@ te the wars that followed imperial germany ’ s rise as a historical parallel to the sin@@ o-@@ american relationship today .
but a better example – in which a global he@@ gem@@ on accommo@@ dates an emerging power – might be the united kingdom ’ s acceptance of america ’ s rise .
as china ’ s leaders define the country ’ s global role , they should bear in mind the success of the uk ’ s approach – as well as the failure of imperial germany ’ s arrogant diplomacy .
the politics of young and old
paris – if one consi@@ ders some of today ’ s main challenges – including climate change , pen@@ sions , public debt , and the labor market – an obvious conclusion emerges : it is relatively much worse to be young today than it was a quar@@ ter-@@ century ago .
yet in most countries , the gener@@ ational dimension is remarkably ab@@ sent from the political debate .
fifty years ago , people spoke often , and lou@@ dly , of a “ generation gap . ”
today , that gap has become invisible .
this is bad for the young , for democracy , and for social justice .
start with climate change . its con@@ tainment requires changing habits and investing in emission reduc@@ tions so that future generations will have a habit@@ able planet .
the alarm bell was first r@@ ung in 1992 at the earth summit in rio de jan@@ ei@@ ro ; but over the last generation , little was done to contain emissions .
and progress following the land@@ mark agreement achieved in paris in december is unlikely to be fast , because the accor@@ d is pre@@ mis@@ ed on post@@ po@@ ning major efforts .
universal as@@ sent was made possible only by further del@@ a@@ ying .
given the massive iner@@ tia inherent in the greenhouse effect , the gap between responsible and ir@@ responsible behavior will start resul@@ ting in different temperatures only in a quar@@ ter-@@ century , and major consequences will follow only in 50 years .
anyone older than 60 today will hardly notice the difference between the two scenarios .
but the fate of most citizens currently younger than 30 will be fundamentally affected .
in due course , the res@@ pite gained by the older generations will have to be paid for by the younger ones .
now consider debt . since 1990 , public debt has increased by about 40 percentage points of gdp in the european union and the united states ( and much more in japan ) .
given near-@@ zero interest rates , the corresponding drag on income is currently low ; but , because inflation is virtually in@@ exist@@ ent and growth is ane@@ mic , the debt rati@@ os have only stabili@@ zed .
so debt reduction will take longer than expected in the after@@ math of the global crisis , which will depri@@ ve the coming generations of the fiscal space they might need to invest in climate action or in the con@@ tainment of security threats .
future pen@@ sions represent another form of debt .
the pa@@ y-@@ as-@@ you@@ -@@ go ( pay@@ g ) systems in place in many countries are giant inter@@ gener@@ ational transfer sch@@ emes .
true , everyone is expected to contribute while they work , before becoming a recipi@@ ent in retirement .
in an ideal steady state , pension regimes would not re@@ distribute income across co@@ hor@@ ts born at different points in time .
as specialists say , they would be gener@@ ation@@ ally neutral .
but the baby boomers ( those born from the mid-@@ 194@@ 0s to the mid-@@ 1960s ) paid little into the pay@@ g sch@@ emes because economic growth , population size , and their parents ’ low life expectancy made finan@@ cing pen@@ sions easy .
all these factors have now gone into reverse : growth has slowed , the baby boomers are a demographic bul@@ ge weigh@@ ing on their children , and they are expected to live long .
countries where pension reforms were introduced early have been able to limit the resul@@ ting burden on the young and keep the balance between generations approximately fair .
but countries where reforms were del@@ a@@ yed have allowed that balance to place the young at a dis@@ advantage .
finally , consider the labor market . over the last decade , conditions for new ent@@ rants have wor@@ sen@@ ed marke@@ dly in many countries .
the number of young people categ@@ orized as ne@@ et ( neither in employment nor in education or training ) currently stands at 10@@ .@@ 2 million in the us and 14 million in the eu .
in contin@@ ental europe , especially , young workers are the first to suffer from economic down@@ turns .
on all of these issues – climate , debt , pen@@ sions , and jobs – the younger generations have been made relatively worse off by developments over the last quar@@ ter-@@ century .
a telling symbol is that there is often more poverty among the young than among the elderly .
this ought to be a major political issue , with significant implications for public finan@@ ces , social protection , tax policy , and labor market regulation .
and it rein@@ forces the imperative of revi@@ ving growth through produ@@ c@@ tivi@@ ty-@@ boo@@ sting policies .
yet the new generation gap has had little direct political effect .
it hardly arises in elec@@ toral debate and has generally not led to the emergence of new parties or movements .
instead , the gener@@ ational divide shows up in elec@@ toral participation .
in the latest us mid-@@ term elections , the turn@@ out rate among younger citizens was less than 20 % , compared to more than 50 % for senior voters .
similar trends are obser@@ vable in other countries .
despite the increased uncertainty they face , younger citizens are much more dis@@ engaged from elec@@ toral politics than their parents and grandparents were at the same age .
this gener@@ ational gap in elec@@ toral participation explains why politicians care more about the elderly than about the young .
but in aging societies , the more the young ab@@ sta@@ in from voting , the more decisions by parli@@ am@@ ents and governments will be biased against their interests .
true , parents are generally not selfish .
they help their children through private transfers and gr@@ ants .
but only those with income and wealth can provide meaningful support .
the result of negle@@ cting young people collectively while supporting them priv@@ ately is social inequality on a massive scale .
how to red@@ ress gener@@ ational biases in the political system is a key question for all democracies .
solutions do exist : mand@@ atory voting , term limits for elected officials , and youth parli@@ am@@ ents or special bodies to examine inter@@ gener@@ ational issues , for example .
but such measures are either difficult to implement or only moder@@ ately effective in view of the magnitude of the challenges .
what is unclear is when and how young people will recognize that and make themselves heard .
your genes or mine , how different are we ?
for some time , scientists have believed that individual human beings were 99.@@ 9 % genetically identical . the 0.@@ 1 % of the genome that was different ( approximately 3,@@ 00@@ 0,000 bases of dna ) was com@@ prised of “ single nucle@@ o@@ tide poly@@ morph@@ is@@ ms ” ( sn@@ ps are alter@@ ations of the individual bases of dna ) scat@@ tered throughout the genome .
it was thought that some of these dna alter@@ ations may in part explain some of the physical differences that exist between two different , but otherwise normal individuals .
in the summer of 2004 , two groups of scientists working independently ( one led by researchers at harvard medical school and bri@@ g@@ ham and women ’ s hospital in boston and the other led by researchers at cold spring harbor laboratories ) called this scientific dog@@ ma into question .
their research identified hundreds of regions of the human genome where the number of copies of a particular dna segment varied from individual to individual .
with only a few exceptions , all dna se@@ gments were thought to exist in two copies ( one copy inherited from your mother and one copy inherited from your father ) .
both studies showed that there are hundreds of regions of the genome that could have more or less than the expected two copies .
this al@@ er@@ ted scientists to the existence of a larger source of genetic variation than was previously understood , and forced us to specu@@ late on the implications of this discovery .
this discovery was made recently because until now , the technology was not available to comprehen@@ sively ass@@ ess genom@@ ic im@@ balances in a genom@@ e-@@ wide fashion .
that has changed over the last five or six years , with the development of a technique known as “ ar@@ ra@@ y-based compar@@ ative genom@@ ic hybri@@ di@@ zation ” ( ar@@ ra@@ y-@@ c@@ gh ) , revolution@@ izing genetic research and diagnostics .
about three years ago at bri@@ g@@ ham and women ’ s hospital , when we were seeking a potential tool for high-resolution diagnostics , ar@@ ra@@ y-@@ c@@ gh offered the hope of providing a reliable and efficient genom@@ e-@@ wide test that could detect gains or losses in an un@@ biased and non-@@ subjective fashion .
when vali@@ dation experiments were performed that compared the dna from one “ normal , healthy ” individual with the dna from another “ normal , healthy ” individual , we were aston@@ ished to find an average of 12 dna fragments that showed copy number differences between the two individuals being compared .
these became known as copy number vari@@ ants , or cn@@ vs .
combining the data from our study and the study from cold spring harbor laboratories , over 300 regions of the genome were found to exhibit cn@@ vs among normal individuals .
since these two initial studies , many other groups , including ours , have confir@@ med and documented many more cn@@ vs in other individuals studied .
this is the goal of the structural genom@@ ic variation con@@ sor@@ tium ’ s copy number variation project , which aims at providing researchers the most comprehensive list and characteri@@ zation of cn@@ vs in humans .
the con@@ sor@@ tium recently ass@@ essed 2@@ 70 individuals from four populations with ancestry in africa , asia or europe ( known as the ha@@ p@@ map collection ) to construct a new map of the human genome .
using two comple@@ mentary genom@@ e-@@ wide technologies , with subsequ@@ ent vali@@ dation studies , a total of 1,@@ 4@@ 47 cn@@ vs were identified .
the data clearly demonstrate that individuals are not as genetically similar as once thought .
many of the regions in which the cn@@ vs were identified over@@ la@@ pped known disease genes .
since they are being identified in normal individuals , cn@@ vs may not necessarily be a direct cause of human disease , but many may con@@ fer sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility to certain diseases , serve as disease markers , and / or indicate potential regions of genom@@ ic inst@@ ability .
some cn@@ vs are also associated with genes involved in immune response and de@@ to@@ xi@@ fi@@ ca@@ tion-@@ related metabolism ( some of the human body ’ s reactions to the environment that we live in ) .
indeed , some cn@@ vs may turn out to explain why some people react differently to specific medications .
hopefully , a more comprehensive understanding of human genetic variation ( i.@@ e. single base pair changes and structural genom@@ ic variation , such as cn@@ vs ) will ultimately help physicians to prescribe medication in a more individu@@ alized manner , that would result in maximum therapeu@@ tic effects to each patient , with minimal side effects .
overall , we anticipate that many of these cn@@ vs will provide explanations to how we adapt and interact with our ever-@@ changing environment .
indeed , as studies continue to identify and characteri@@ ze cn@@ vs , we anticipate achieving a better understanding of the relationship between these genetic variations , complex diseases , and human adap@@ tability .
un@@ bur@@ dening the facebook generation
los angeles – once again , young people have gotten the short end of the political stick .
the outcome of the united kingdom ’ s bre@@ x@@ it refer@@ end@@ um is but another reminder of a y@@ aw@@ ning gener@@ ational divide that cuts across political aff@@ ili@@ ation , income levels , and race .
almost 75 % of uk voters aged 18-@@ 24 voted to “ remain ” in the european union , only to have “ leave ” imposed on them by older voters .
and this is just one of several ways in which millenni@@ als ’ economic future , and that of their children , is being determined by others .
i am in my late fif@@ ties , and i worry that our generation in the advanced world will be remembered – to our shame and cha@@ gr@@ in – as the one that lost the economic plot .
in the run@@ -up to the 2008 global financial crisis , we fe@@ ast@@ ed on leverage , feeling increasingly entitled to use credit to live beyond our means and to assume too much specu@@ lative financial risk .
we stopped investing in genuine engines of growth , letting our infrastructure deca@@ y , our education system lag , and our worker training and re@@ tool@@ ing programs ero@@ de .
we allowed the budget to be taken ho@@ stage by special interests , which has resulted in a frag@@ mentation of the tax system that , no surprise , has im@@ par@@ ted yet another unfair anti-@@ growth bias to the economic system .
and we witnessed a dramatic wor@@ sen@@ ing in inequality , not just of income and wealth , but also of opportunity .
the 2008 crisis should have been our economic wa@@ ke@@ -up call .
it wasn ’ t .
rather than using the crisis to cataly@@ ze change , we essentially rolled over and went back to doing more of the same .
we swa@@ pped an over-@@ lever@@ aged banking system for experimental liqui@@ dity inje@@ ctions by hyper@@ active mon@@ etary authorities .
in the process , we over@@ bur@@ den@@ ed central banks , ris@@ king their credi@@ bility and political autonomy , as well as future financial stability .
emerging from the crisis , we shifted private li@@ abilities from banks ’ balance sheets to taxpa@@ yers , including future ones , yet we failed to fix fully the bai@@ led-@@ out financial sector .
we let inequality wor@@ sen , and stood by as too many young people in europe langu@@ ished in job@@ lessness , ris@@ king a scary transition from unemployment to un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ability .
in short , we didn ’ t do nearly enough to rein@@ vi@@ gor@@ ate the engines of sustainable inclusive growth , thereby also weak@@ ening potential output and threatening future economic performance .
and we are com@@ po@@ unding these serial mis@@ carri@@ ages with a grand failure to act on lon@@ ger-@@ term sustainability , particularly when it comes to the planet and social co@@ h@@ esi@@ on .
poor economics has naturally sp@@ illed over into messy politics , as growing se@@ gments of the population have lost trust in the political establishment , business elites , and expert opinion .
the resul@@ ting political frag@@ mentation , including the rise of fr@@ inge and anti-@@ establishment movements , has made it even harder to dev@@ ise more appropriate econom@@ ic@@ -@@ policy responses .
to add insu@@ lt to injury , we are now per@@ mit@@ ting a regul@@ atory bac@@ klas@@ h against technological innovations that dis@@ rupt ent@@ ren@@ ched and inefficient industries , and that provide people with greater control over their lives and well@@ being .
growing restri@@ ctions on companies such as airbnb and u@@ ber hit the young particularly hard , both as producers and as consumers .
if we do not change course soon , subsequ@@ ent generations will confront self-@@ rein@@ forcing economic , financial , and political tenden@@ cies that burden them with too little growth , too much debt , artifi@@ cially in@@ fl@@ ated asset prices , and alarming levels of inequality and partisan political polari@@ zation .
fortunately , we are aware of the moun@@ ting problem , worried about its consequences , and have a good sense of how to bring about the mu@@ ch-@@ needed pi@@ vo@@ t .
given the role of technological innovation , much of which is you@@ th-@@ led , even a small re@@ orientation of policies could have a meaningful and rapid impact on the economy . through a more comprehensive policy approach , we could turn a vicious cycle of economic stag@@ nation , social im@@ mobility , and market vola@@ tili@@ ty into a virtu@@ ous cycle of inclusive growth , genuine financial stability , and greater political coher@@ ence .
what is needed , in particular , is simul@@ taneous progress on pro-@@ growth structural reforms , better demand management , addressing pockets of exc@@ essive inde@@ b@@ tedness , and improving regional and global policy frame@@ works .
while highly des@@ ir@@ able , such changes will materi@@ alize only if greater construc@@ tive pressure is placed on politicians .
simply put , few politicians will champion changes that promise lon@@ ger-@@ term benefits but often come with short-term disrup@@ tions . and the older voters who back them will resist any meaningful erosion of their enti@@ tle@@ ments – even turning , when they perceive a threat to their interests , to popu@@ list politicians and danger@@ ously simplistic solutions such as bre@@ x@@ it .
sadly , young people have been over@@ ly com@@ plac@@ ent when it comes to political participation , not@@ ably on matters that directly affect their well@@ being and that of their children .
yes , almost three-@@ quarters of young voters backed the uk ’ s “ remain ” campaign .
but only a third of them turned out .
in contrast , the participation rate for those over 65 was more than 80 % .
und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly , the absence of young people at the polls left the decision in the hands of older people , whose preferences and moti@@ vations differ , even if inno@@ cent@@ ly .
millenni@@ als have impres@@ sively gained a greater say in how they communicate , travel , source and dissemin@@ ate information , pool their resources , interact with businesses , and much else .
now they must seek a greater say in elec@@ ting their political representatives and in holding them accountable .
if they don ’ t , my generation will – mostly in@@ adver@@ tently – continue to borrow exc@@ essi@@ vely from their future .
yu@@ kos now , russia &apos;s economy later
just as famili@@ arity bre@@ eds contemp@@ t , success often spa@@ w@@ ns com@@ plac@@ ency .
sadly , that seems to be the case in russia , where the government has chosen the first period of pro@@ lon@@ ged economic growth since communism &apos;s fall@@ -@@ -@@ with the budget in surplus and capital flight seemingly rever@@ se@@ d-@@ -@@ to re-@@ open the oli@@ gar@@ ch wars of the 1990 &apos;s .
optimi@@ sts be@@ ware : the arrest of mik@@ ha@@ il k@@ ho@@ dor@@ ko@@ v@@ sk@@ y-@@ -@@ and the freezing of his shares in oil giant yu@@ ko@@ s-@@ -@@ will have a profound long-term impact on russia &apos;s economy and on relations between business and government .
the yu@@ kos im@@ bro@@ gli@@ o will not bring russia &apos;s economy to a scre@@ ech@@ ing halt , because no single company determines the country &apos;s fate . but long-term pro@@ spe@@ cts are certain to de@@ terior@@ ate .
&quot; operation clean hands &quot; -@@ -@@ what some are calling the investig@@ ations into k@@ ho@@ dor@@ ko@@ v@@ sky and his associ@@ at@@ es-@@ -@@ will not increase tax revenue , but only spur growth in the informal economy , as business@@ men try to conce@@ al their affairs even more completely from the government .
after all , once russia &apos;s richest man can be stripped of his assets at any moment , ordinary russian business@@ men may be for@@ given for conclu@@ ding that operating in the open is risky .
the first signs of this realization will probably take the form of an increase in capital flight .
until the yu@@ kos aff@@ air , capital flight was rever@@ sing .
after a decade of he@@ mor@@ r@@ ha@@ ging capital , the first half of this year saw data indic@@ ating that russians who had taken their money out of the country were bringing it back to invest at home .
if capital flight res@@ um@@ es , it will quickly snow@@ ball if president pu@@ tin fails to convince people that the yu@@ kos aff@@ air is an isolated case .
i believe that capital flight will increase substan@@ tially .
reduced business activity , with long-term investment projects being can@@ cell@@ ed , seems just as certain .
a lower rate of economic growth thus seems inevitable .
independent russian economic experts are un@@ anim@@ ous in sharing this grim conclusion .
only people linked to the regime appear to differ .
if investment st@@ alls , president pu@@ tin will have no hope of doubling the size of the economy within a decade , as he has promised .
my long@@ standing skep@@ ticism about this promise has now har@@ den@@ ed into certainty : the yu@@ kos aff@@ air will make it impossible to sustain the growth rate required to achieve this goal because the arrest of mik@@ ha@@ il k@@ ho@@ dor@@ ko@@ v@@ sky and the sei@@ z@@ ure of his assets has dealt a devastating blow to business confidence .
indeed , times have changed dramatically since the cu@@ t@@ throat russian capitalism of the 1990 &apos;@@ s-@@ -@@ supposedly a world in which entrepreneurs were in@@ different , at best , to each other &apos;s problems .
that car@@ ic@@ ature , if ever true , is certainly not true today : the business community &apos;s negative reaction to the per@@ secu@@ tion of k@@ ho@@ dor@@ ko@@ v@@ sky by the law en@@ for@@ cement agencies has been strong and nearly un@@ anim@@ ous .
the growing calls of some state officials to deal with economic crime are viewed by the business community as both a mo@@ cker@@ y of the legal code and a vei@@ led threat that the pro@@ secu@@ tors want their cut of russia &apos;s ri@@ ches .
the improved image of russia &apos;s legal system is in tat@@ ters .
today , the business community understands that the pro@@ secu@@ tor general &apos;s office can find any pre@@ text to go after any one of them .
if pro@@ secu@@ tors can treat huge businesses so roughly , what hope is there for medium and small businesses ?
no surprise , then , that owners of companies of all sizes are now forming a united front to protect their interests .
president pu@@ tin , meanwhile , ste@@ ad@@ fa@@ stly ref@@ uses to discuss the yu@@ kos aff@@ air or the actions of the law en@@ for@@ cement agencies with russia &apos;s business community .
his silence clearly impli@@ es consent to the actions of the pro@@ secu@@ tors .
but if the president will not publicly account for the fi@@ deli@@ ty of russia &apos;s law en@@ for@@ cement agencies to law , who will ?
one of the great flaws of pu@@ tin &apos;s pres@@ iden@@ cy has been to allow law en@@ for@@ cement agencies to evaluate their own actions .
of course , they inv@@ ari@@ ably conclude that their actions were right and law@@ ful .
so the president &apos;s position is clear and he will not back down .
in fact , only busines@@ spe@@ op@@ le may now be able to influence events : a sharp and pronoun@@ ced slow@@ down , with russian capital showing its dis@@ pleasure by voting with its feet , might be the last hope for turning the pro@@ secu@@ tors from their chosen course .
but i see no reason for optimism .
on the contrary , the arrest of k@@ ho@@ dor@@ ko@@ v@@ sky has only wh@@ et@@ ted the pro@@ secu@@ tors &apos; appeti@@ te .
once they have di@@ gest@@ ed yu@@ kos , they will look for another meal .
after that , can anyone seriously doubt that the cra@@ ving for fresh prey will intensi@@ fy ?
a prisoner ’ s refle@@ ctions on nelson mandela
k@@ har@@ ki@@ v – incarcer@@ ation is said to leave you with a feeling of hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness and vulnerability .
but the truth of life for a political prisoner , even for one on a hunger strike , is the opposite .
as a prisoner , i have been forced to focus on what is essential about myself , my political beliefs , and my country .
so i can almost feel the presence of the brave women and men , old and young , who have gathered in k@@ yi@@ v and other ukra@@ ini@@ an cities to defend their dreams of a democratic and european future .
in prison , your hopes and dreams become your reality .
i am sure that nelson mandela would have understood my feelings and agreed .
the south african apartheid regime may have locked him away for almost three decades , but in the great so@@ we@@ to prote@@ sts and the other demon@@ strations for freedom and equality , courageous young south africans inv@@ ari@@ ably looked to his example and felt his presence .
around the world , most people now rightly celebrate the gentle dignity with which mandela led south africa out of the political wilderness .
even here , behind prison bars and 24-@@ hour surveillance of the type that he experienced for so long , i can con@@ j@@ ure the warmth of his broad smile , mer@@ ry eyes , and those colorful hawai@@ i@@ an-@@ style shirts that he wore with such pan@@ a@@ che .
and i can admire his un@@ yiel@@ ding – and , yes , sometimes wi@@ ly – commitment to reconciliation , which saved his country from the race war that those who refused to accept the end of whit@@ e-@@ minority rule saw as inevitable .
how wrong they were , and how miracul@@ ous was mandela ’ s achievement in making even his most im@@ plac@@ able enemies feel at home in post-@@ apartheid south africa .
no pur@@ ges marked the end of white rule .
there were no wit@@ ch-@@ hun@@ ts , nor was there summary justice .
all that mandela demand@@ ed was that the truth about the past be revealed .
through the unique innovation of the truth and reconciliation commission , mandela found the only viable bridge between his country ’ s ra@@ cist legacy and its multi-@@ racial present and future – a combination of political genius and humane wisdom that only the greatest of leaders poss@@ ess .
mandela was able to guide south africa to freedom , because he was able to see its future more clearly than those who lived through the apartheid years outside of prison .
indeed , he poss@@ essed that rare clarity of moral vision that prison – perhaps like no other environment – can nurture .
im@@ prison@@ ment brought ale@@ k@@ sand@@ r sol@@ z@@ hen@@ it@@ sy@@ n this clarity as well . “ gradually it was dis@@ closed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states , nor between classes , nor between political parties , either – but right through every human heart – and through all human hearts , ” he wrote in the gu@@ lag archi@@ pel@@ ago .
“ this line shifts … .@@ and even within hearts overwhelmed by evil , one small brid@@ ge@@ head of good is re@@ tained .
and even in the best of all hearts , there remains ... an un-@@ u@@ pro@@ oted small corner of evil . ”
the ability to begin to see more clearly than most the inner work@@ ings of the human soul is one of the few gifts that im@@ prison@@ ment can be@@ sto@@ w .
forced to reck@@ on with your own vulnerability , isolation , and losses ( and seemingly lost cause ) , you learn to look more carefully into the human heart – yours and that of your ja@@ il@@ ers .
mandela epit@@ om@@ ized this rare gift .
how else could he have personally invited one of his robben island ja@@ il@@ ers to attend his in@@ augu@@ ration as south africa ’ s first democra@@ tically elected president ?
of course , behind mandela ’ s generous spirit was a character of steel .
he bor@@ e his im@@ prison@@ ment for the sake of his cause .
and he bor@@ e the angu@@ ish of the suffering imposed on his family .
and yet he neither broke nor sur@@ rendered to the rage that would have consumed most people .
sweet caroline in tokyo
but j@@ f@@ k ’ s el@@ dest daughter , caroline kennedy , was not present at either event ; she had just taken up her post in tokyo as the 29@@ th us ambassador to japan .
on november 19 , thousands of people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of kennedy as she made her way from tokyo station to the imperial palace , around a kilometer away , by hor@@ se-@@ drawn carriage to present her cre@@ denti@@ als to the emper@@ or .
waving to the on@@ loo@@ kers , she looked like snow white .
november 22 , 196@@ 3 , was also the day satellite broadcasting from the united states to japan began , and many japanese got up early to watch a speech by j@@ f@@ k in dallas that began at 5 : 30 a.@@ m .
but , rather than air@@ ing the speech , the broadcast brought the shocking news of the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation .
the image of young caroline – the inspiration for neil diamond ’ s famous song – so@@ lem@@ n@@ ly standing beside her three-year-old brother as he sal@@ u@@ ted his father ’ s co@@ ff@@ in is deeply en@@ gra@@ ined in the hearts of japan ’ s people .
so there probably is not a single japanese who would not welcome her as us ambassador .
us ambassad@@ ors to japan have come in three types . there have been academic experts on japan , like the acc@@ la@@ imed scholar ed@@ win rei@@ schau@@ er .
there have also been political hea@@ v@@ y@@ wei@@ ghts , such as michael man@@ s@@ field , a long-@@ time democratic majority leader of the us senate , former vice president walter mond@@ ale , former speaker of the house of representatives thomas fo@@ ley , and senator howard baker , who also served as president ronald reagan ’ s chief of staff .
the third type are presidential political ap@@ poin@@ te@@ es , such as thomas schie@@ ffer , a former business partner of president george w. bush , and john ro@@ os , a not@@ ed silicon valley lawyer .
clearly , caroline kennedy , an important early suppor@@ ter of president barack obama , is in this category .
indeed , her bac@@ king for obama in the democratic party primar@@ ies in 2008 , when he was still a relatively unknown senator from illinois , gave his campaign credi@@ bility among party insi@@ ders who remain lo@@ yal to her family ’ s legacy .
kennedy ’ s address to the senate foreign relations committee during her confir@@ mation hearing e@@ lic@@ ited bi@@ partisan support – a rare occurr@@ ence nowadays , given america ’ s highly polari@@ zed national politics – and she received un@@ anim@@ ous approval .
although she lac@@ ks formal political or diplo@@ matic experience , her personal connections , particularly to obama , will have great significance for us-@@ japan relations .
and there are pressing issues that need the new ambassador ’ s attention .
for example , there are security questions related to streng@@ th@@ ening the alliance between japan and the us , including the reloc@@ ation of the fu@@ ten@@ ma air station , the base of operations for the us marine corps on okin@@ a@@ wa .
there are also issues related to economic cooperation , such as the trans@@ -@@ pacific partnership ( t@@ pp ) , the proposed mega-@@ regional free-@@ trade treaty covering pacific ri@@ m economies .
although powerful domestic interest groups , particularly those representing the agricultural sector , have obje@@ cted to japanese participation in the t@@ pp negotiations , prime minister sh@@ in@@ z@@ o abe ’ s government chose to join the talks late in the day .
instead of banking the political capital that his high approval ratings had given him , he chose to spend some of it on an initiative that his pre@@ de@@ cess@@ ors had rejected , but that will help to transform myri@@ ad aspects of japan ’ s economy .
of course , given today ’ s hyper-@@ partisan environment in the us , there is a danger that fast-@@ track negotiating authority – under which congress bin@@ ds itself to an up-@@ or-@@ down vote on trade agre@@ ements ( thereby pre@@ clu@@ ding am@@ end@@ ments and fili@@ bu@@ sters ) – will not be given to the president .
if this road@@ block cannot be overcome and the agreement st@@ alls , the abe government ’ s approval ratings will suffer , despite progress in the negotiations .
given the un@@ anim@@ ity with which kennedy was confir@@ med , she may be able to use her own political capital to help sell fast-@@ track authority in congress .
the abe government is banking on its high approval rating not only to participate in the t@@ pp , but also to address the need to escape from 15 years of def@@ lation and streng@@ then japan ’ s nation@@ al-@@ security posture , which has been ham@@ str@@ ung for decades .
given the nex@@ us of issues that tie vital us interests to japan ’ s reform process , kennedy , with her character and skills , could well prove to be an essential link between the countries at a crucial point in their relationship .
who lost thailand ?
tokyo – thailand , southeast asia ’ s most developed and sophisticated economy , is tee@@ tering on the edge of the political aby@@ ss .
yet most of the rest of asia appears to be aver@@ ting its eyes from the country ’ s ongoing and increasingly an@@ arch@@ ic un@@ rest .
that in@@ difference is not only fo@@ oli@@ sh ; it is dangerous .
asia ’ s democracies now risk confron@@ ting the same harsh question that the united states faced when mao ze@@ d@@ ong mar@@ ched into beijing , and again when ay@@ at@@ ol@@ la@@ h ru@@ hol@@ la@@ h k@@ hom@@ ein@@ i ou@@ sted the shah in iran .
who , they will have to ask , lost thailand ?
much of the world is wondering how such a successful economy could allow its politics to spin out of control .
what accounts for the ar@@ mies of prote@@ sters – distingu@@ ished , gan@@ g-@@ like , by the color of their shirts – whose mutual anti@@ pathy often borders on ni@@ hi@@ li@@ stic rage ?
the roots of the current un@@ rest extend back more than a decade , to former prime minister th@@ ak@@ sin sh@@ in@@ a@@ wat@@ ra ’ s first elec@@ toral victory in 2001 .
th@@ ak@@ sin ’ s triumph did not represent the normal alter@@ nation in power that one finds in a democracy .
instead , his victory her@@ al@@ ded the political rise of the country ’ s poor , long-@@ sil@@ enced rural majority .
bang@@ k@@ ok ’ s ent@@ ren@@ ched elite reco@@ iled in alarm .
but , instead of learning to compete with th@@ ak@@ sin for the votes of thailand ’ s rural poor , the country ’ s urban elite ( including the powerful military ) sought to dele@@ gi@@ ti@@ mize his rule .
when he was re-@@ elected by an even larger majority , his government was over@@ thrown , his political party was banned by the supreme court , and he was forced to fle@@ e the country after corruption charges against him led to a criminal convi@@ ction .
yet th@@ ak@@ sin ’ s suppor@@ ters did not abandon him .
when thailand ’ s military returned to their bar@@ ra@@ cks , many thai citizens voted for th@@ ak@@ sin at one remove , with his sister – y@@ ing@@ luck sh@@ in@@ a@@ wat@@ ra , a long-@@ time executive at th@@ ak@@ sin ’ s communications firm – becoming prime minister , supported by a powerful parli@@ am@@ entary majority .
for much of her term in office , y@@ ing@@ luck gar@@ ner@@ ed praise for her prag@@ mati@@ sm , and for seeking to am@@ eli@@ or@@ ate the an@@ tag@@ on@@ ism of her oppon@@ ents .
but that praise and success appears to have b@@ red a form of hu@@ bris .
she proposed an am@@ ne@@ sty law that would have not only par@@ don@@ ed opposition leaders , including ab@@ his@@ it ve@@ j@@ ja@@ ji@@ va , her pre@@ de@@ cess@@ or as prime minister ( who faces murder charges ) , but allowed her brother to return to the country .
and , in defi@@ ance of a supreme court rul@@ ing , she sought a constitu@@ tional am@@ end@@ ment that would make the senate , whose members are ap@@ pointed , an elected body .
the opposition , sensing that its moment had arrived , launched a wave of street prote@@ sts .
y@@ ing@@ luck , in an effort to def@@ use the situation , called for a parli@@ am@@ entary election in february .
but the opposition has rejected this and says that it will boy@@ cot@@ t the vote .
it fears – rightly , most people suspect – that the th@@ ak@@ sin camp will be returned to power in any free and fair vote .
so , in essence , what is happening in thailand is an attempted nu@@ lli@@ fication of democracy by the opposition and the country ’ s ent@@ ren@@ ched elite .
unable to compete successfully with th@@ ak@@ sin for votes , they now want to dil@@ ute thai democracy in order to prevent the elec@@ tor@@ ate from ever again choosing a government that goes against their will .
if thailand were an in@@ significant country with little geo@@ strategic weight , its problems might not matter as much as they do to the rest of asia .
but thailand is southeast asia ’ s lyn@@ ch@@ pin economy .
it is a key partner for my@@ an@@ mar ( burma ) as it makes its own political and economic transition , and it is a hub for trade with neighbor@@ ing cambodia , la@@ os , and vietnam .
but the biggest reason that thailand matters for asia ’ s democracies is fier@@ ce competition for influence between a rising china and the democratic world .
its military is mostly trained by the united states ; indeed , it was the key st@@ aging point for the us during the vietnam war .
likewise , japan and india have long regarded thailand as a democratic bul@@ war@@ k in a neighborhood where some regimes – cambodia and la@@ os – are firmly under china ’ s he@@ ge@@ mon@@ ic s@@ way .
indeed , its government has proved to be a strong suppor@@ ter of my@@ an@@ mar ’ s president , th@@ ein sein , as he see@@ ks to free his country from china ’ s tight embrace .
by standing aside as thailand ’ s opposition and traditional elite seek to under@@ mine the country ’ s democracy in the name of a permanent right to rule , asia ’ s democracies risk driving some elements of the th@@ ak@@ sin camp into the arms of china , which would happily accept the role of pat@@ ron to so potent a political force .
but this need not happen .
thailand ’ s military has long and respectful ties not only with the us military , but with officers in japan as well .
thailand ’ s opposition politicians , many of whom were educated at top western universities , may also be open to quiet advice that they are pushing things too far , not only putting thailand ’ s stability at risk , but also je@@ opar@@ di@@ zing regional security .
just as , a decade ago , the west obje@@ cted to the efforts of turkey ’ s ent@@ ren@@ ched secular elite to rob re@@ ce@@ p ta@@ y@@ yi@@ p er@@ do@@ ğ@@ an ’ s mil@@ dly islam@@ ist ak@@ p party of its democratic victory , it needs to speak clearly today in defense of thai democracy .
the opposition ’ s claim that it is acting in the interests of the world ’ s democracies needs to be re@@ butt@@ ed .
th@@ ak@@ sin may be no saint , and some constitu@@ tional reform will be needed if political reconciliation is to come about .
but th@@ ak@@ sin ’ s governments , like that of his sister , have kept china at one remove from influence .
that is the key strategic interest that is now at stake .
should y@@ ing@@ luck be ou@@ sted in a coup , or should the country ’ s democracy be hol@@ lo@@ wed out to pre@@ clu@@ de her return to power , the sh@@ in@@ a@@ wat@@ r@@ as may be left with no choice but to seek support from thailand ’ s giant neighbor to the north .
if that happens , we will all know who lost thailand .
we did .
equality or e@@ str@@ ange@@ ment
tokyo – those whom the gods would destroy , they grant their wishes .
will that bit of ancient wisdom now hold for the united states and japan ?
for a half-@@ century , the us , which wrote japan ’ s post@@ war “ peace ” constitution , has pres@@ sed the japanese to play a greater role in maintaining asian and global stability .
but now that japan finally has a leader who agrees , the us is getting nervous , with secretary of state john kerry supposedly calling japan under prime minister sh@@ in@@ z@@ o abe “ unpredictable . ”
these strains in the us-@@ japan relationship – surely the foundation stone of asian stability – first became notic@@ e@@ able in december , when abe visited the y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i shr@@ ine in tokyo , which houses the “ souls ” of ( among others ) class a war criminals from the pacific war .
the us has always criticized japanese officials ’ vis@@ its to the shr@@ ine , but through diplo@@ matic channels .
this time , america voic@@ ed its dis@@ pleasure open@@ ly .
the us is rightly concerned about the negative impact of such pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ges on japan ’ s relations with its neighbors , particularly china and south korea .
but the harsh tone publicly adopted by president barack obama ’ s administration raised serious concerns among some in abe ’ s government who question obama ’ s commitment to the alliance and suspect that he was using the y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i issue as a pre@@ text to signal a weak@@ ening of america ’ s defense commitment .
such suspi@@ ci@@ ons were shar@@ pen@@ ed after china declared its new air defense identi@@ fication zone , which over@@ laps japanese sovereig@@ n territory .
the us tried to have it both ways : though the obama administration sent us bom@@ bers through the new adi@@ z to demonstrate its ref@@ us@@ al to recognize china ’ s move , it also told us commercial air@@ lin@@ ers to acknowledge the zone and report their flight plans to the chinese authorities .
likewise , us acqui@@ es@@ cence in china ’ s de fac@@ to ou@@ ster of the philippines from the sc@@ arb@@ or@@ ough sho@@ al ( a dispu@@ ted out@@ cro@@ pping in the south china sea ) raised questions in japan about the two countries ’ supposed harmony of interests .
in fact , although the us ex@@ t@@ ols the virtues of its partnership with japan , succ@@ essive american presidents have been vague about the details .
ultimately , the idea always seemed to be that japan would pay more for defense , but the us would set the partnership ’ s obje@@ ctives .
abe ’ s conception of the us-@@ japan partnership pres@@ up@@ poses much greater equality .
after all , a society like japan , trying to escape two decades of economic mal@@ a@@ ise , cannot feel completely comfortable outsour@@ cing its nation@@ al-@@ security strategy , even to an ally that is as respected and reliable as the us .
far from being based on ch@@ est@@ -@@ thum@@ ping nation@@ alism , abe ’ s nation@@ al-@@ security strategy reflects , above all , a deep awareness of how a lost generation of economic growth has affected the japanese .
his bra@@ v@@ ura diplo@@ matic performances sometimes give the impression that a self-@@ confident japan has been a normal feature of the global landscape .
strangely , it is all but forgotten – particularly by the chinese – that for two decades japan has watched china ’ s rise quietly from the si@@ del@@ ines ( even suppor@@ tively , to the extent that japanese investors have poured in billions of dollars in the three decades since deng xia@@ oping opened the economy ) .
indeed , abe has succeeded so well in returning japan to the world stage that his us and asian cri@@ tics act as if the only problem now is to moder@@ ate japanese self-@@ confidence – a notion that would have been lau@@ g@@ hable just two years ago .
but the fact remains that one of abe ’ s primary worries is the spiritual mal@@ a@@ ise that accompanied japan ’ s long economic stag@@ nation . those who see in his patri@@ otic rhetoric a desire to white@@ wash history miss his real concern : economic revi@@ val is meaningless if it does not secure japan ’ s position as a leading asian power .
the us , however , regar@@ ds abe ’ s worries about japan ’ s spirit as peripher@@ al to its efforts to for@@ ge a lasting relationship with china and over@@ haul its strategic presence in the pacific .
for example , the us views the trans@@ -@@ pacific partnership – the huge trade agreement involving it , japan , and 10 other leading pacific ri@@ m countries – as a technical scheme that will bring economic benefits through greater trade .
but , for abe , the t@@ pp ’ s value for japan ’ s sense of identity – that it is now a more out@@ war@@ d-@@ looking nation – is just as important .
in abe ’ s view , japan needs to regain , wherever possible , the right of independent decision-making if it is to manage successfully the challenge posed to it by china . this does not mean that abe ’ s japan will become an ally like france under jacques chi@@ ra@@ c , spur@@ ning us leadership for the sake of it ; instead , abe see@@ ks a policy of cooperation with the us that reflects the alliance &apos;s voluntary nature .
he believes that , given the new balance of power in asia , the alliance will be meaningful only if each partner has a real choice , and the where@@ with@@ al , to act autonom@@ ously or with regional allies .
fortunately , japanese and american analy@@ ses of chinese trends are not very different .
both generally view china as having embar@@ ked on a prob@@ ing strategy in search of weak spots where it can expand its geo@@ political reach .
and both believe that only when china is convinced that such probes will yield no lasting benefit can serious negotiations about a comprehensive security structure for asia take place .
but even here , there is a difference .
the us , convinced of the importance of intentions in the conduct of foreign policy , believes that once china recognizes the limits to its power , a structure of peace will follow naturally .
abe , by contrast , believes that only a favor@@ able balance of power can be reli@@ ed upon , and he is determined that japan play its part in construc@@ ting that balance .
although abe has lifted japan ’ s si@@ ghts and self-@@ confidence , he recognizes that japan faces real limits . the us , too , should recognize that there are limits to the extent of the sub@@ ordin@@ ation that it can ask of an ally .
se@@ cur@@ ing japan
tokyo – sh@@ in@@ z@@ o abe ’ s second term as japan ’ s prime minister began with a las@@ er-@@ like focus on economic revi@@ tali@@ zation .
that policy , almost instantly du@@ b@@ bed “ aben@@ om@@ ics , ” com@@ pris@@ es what have been called the three “ arrows ” : bold mon@@ etary policy , an expan@@ sion@@ ary fiscal stance , and structural reforms to stimulate private investment .
ho@@ sting the olympic games in tokyo in 2020 has added a fourth arrow to this qui@@ ver in the form of increased infrastructure investment and tourism revenue in the years leading up to the games .
to be sure , after 15 years of de@@ fla@@ tionary recession , revi@@ tali@@ zation of the japanese economy remains far from complete .
nonetheless , the effects of abe ’ s reforms are becoming visible in areas such as equity prices and exchange rates .
but abe also confron@@ ts a security environment in asia that is every bit as bri@@ ttle as japan ’ s economy was before his government took office last december .
indeed , he confronted many of the same issues during his first administration seven years ago .
his efforts back then were hal@@ ted by his own res@@ ig@@ nation , and he is now making a second attempt to establish a nation@@ al-@@ security governance system to meet japan ’ s needs – and those of its allies – in twenty-@@ first-@@ century asia .
in a speech to a plen@@ ary session of the lower house of japan ’ s diet on october 25 , abe emphasi@@ zed that , given the current security situation in asia , “ it is essential to streng@@ then command functions for imple@@ menting the prime minister ’ s national security policy . ”
now that split control of the diet ’ s upper and lower houses has been resolved , with abe ’ s liberal democrats in strong control of both cham@@ bers , a bill to moderni@@ ze japan ’ s nation@@ al-@@ security governance is certain to pass .
the bill that abe has submitted aims to establish a japanese national security council , based on lessons from the successes and failures of similar institutions in other countries , such as the n@@ s@@ c in the united states .
the security council of japan – something of a stop@@ gap measure created to provide advice from relevant cabinet members to the prime minister in times of crisis – will now be re@@ organized as a formal institution .
the new n@@ s@@ c ’ s mem@@ ber@@ ship will be limited to the prime minister , the cabinet secretary , and the foreign and defense ministers , with relevant ministers added on an ad ho@@ c basis .
a permanent national security secre@@ tari@@ at , headed by a person with abundant diplo@@ matic experience , will be established in the prime minister ’ s office , with 60 security specialists from various fields laying the policy ground@@ work for medi@@ um@@ - and long-term national security strategy .
this strategy will then be reflected in guidelines issued to japan ’ s defense bodies and diplo@@ mats .
japan , like other countries , has faced jur@@ is@@ dic@@ tional dispu@@ tes among foreig@@ n-@@ policy , defense , and police agencies that have hinder@@ ed the aggre@@ gation and analysis of intelligence information .
but , with the creation of the n@@ s@@ c , each ministry and agency will report important nation@@ al-@@ security information to the new secre@@ tari@@ at , which will then carry out integrated analysis and issue reports to the prime minister and others .
of course , as in other countries , bureau@@ cra@@ cies are creatures of habit . as we can already see , it will not be easy to overcome the obstacles posed by vertically integrated mini@@ stries and agencies .
institution@@ alization will take time – and the importance of its success cannot be under@@ stated .
for example , the new n@@ s@@ c will be responsible for sharing intelligence with other countries , including the us , japan ’ s most important ally .
as a result , en@@ suring the protection of information will be a key issue , particularly given the old habit of lea@@ king security information to the press .
that is why the diet is also considering a bill on the protection of classified information that would impose har@@ sher punishment on government officials who leak secrets , particularly those concern@@ ing national security .
the trauma of ga@@ g laws that were imposed on the press before and during world war ii resulted in the elimin@@ ation of all restra@@ ints afterwards , which had the effect of making japan a sp@@ y ’ s paradise , with in@@ sufficient counter@@ intelligence measures and poor secre@@ cy .
moreover , the long decades of peace since 1945 have served to lower awareness among politicians of the need for confi@@ denti@@ ality .
for example , japanese newspapers always report when , where , and with whom the prime minister met for dinner in the following day ’ s edi@@ tions .
in contrast to the us system of presidential government , japan has a parli@@ am@@ entary form of government .
yet the goals of national security and crisis management are the same in both systems – indeed , one of british prime minister david cameron ’ s first acts when he came to power was to establish an n@@ s@@ c to improve coordination of policy@@ making .
although the establishment of the japanese n@@ s@@ c is long over@@ due , it is not too late for japan to benefit from the improvement in policy direction and coher@@ ence that it seems certain to bring .
how to end an insur@@ gency
tokyo – when the mor@@ o islamic liberation front guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ a movement took up arms in the philippines in the 1960 ’ s , fer@@ din@@ and mar@@ co@@ s had yet to become the country &apos;s president – let alone dictator .
despite the country ’ s many political transforma@@ tions in the last half-@@ century , the mil@@ f ’ s campaign to achieve independence for the bang@@ sam@@ or@@ o nation – whose territory , they claim , covers the islands of min@@ dan@@ ao , pal@@ aw@@ an , sul@@ u , and sab@@ ah – remained constant , until president ben@@ ig@@ no aqu@@ ino i@@ ii resolved to change it .
the mil@@ f was not deter@@ red by the popular over@@ throw of mar@@ co@@ s ’ s 20-@@ year dictator@@ ship in 1986 , following the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of the opposition leader ben@@ ig@@ no aqu@@ ino , jr .
nor did the establishment of democracy – now deeply ent@@ ren@@ ched – inspire the group ’ s leaders to re@@ consider their approach .
the mil@@ f remained engaged in a brutal campaign of be@@ head@@ ings , ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation , kid@@ napp@@ ings , and in@@ discrimin@@ ate but@@ cher@@ y .
then , last january , aqu@@ ino managed to achieve a land@@ mark deal that finally ended min@@ dan@@ ao ’ s ag@@ ony .
this is one of the most remarkable fe@@ ats of peace@@ making in asia since world war ii , and at least as worthy of international recognition as former fin@@ nish president and 2008 nobel peace prize laure@@ ate mar@@ ti ah@@ tis@@ sari ’ s role in bro@@ ker@@ ing peace in ac@@ eh , indonesia , in 2005 .
in fact , given the myri@@ ad security and political risks that aqu@@ ino ran in conclu@@ ding a peace deal with the mil@@ f , he may be an even wor@@ thier nobel laure@@ ate .
aqu@@ ino ’ s approach to the negotiations reflected his recognition that the mil@@ f had twice used peace talks – once bro@@ ker@@ ed by libya ’ s col@@ on@@ el mu@@ am@@ mar el-@@ q@@ ad@@ da@@ fi – as a cy@@ ni@@ cal plo@@ y to buy time to re@@ group and raise funds ( including from al qaeda ) .
with fresh@@ ly re@@ sto@@ cked arsen@@ als , they would rela@@ un@@ ch their campaign to sei@@ ze min@@ dan@@ ao by force .
against this background , it is no surprise that , when aqu@@ ino rela@@ un@@ ched st@@ alled peace talks in 2012 , the fili@@ pin@@ o people were highly skeptical .
but , over time , the effort gained credi@@ bility .
though questions about the peace agreement ’ s dur@@ ability remain , with full dis@@ arma@@ ment yet to take place , the political autonomy granted to the country ’ s muslim areas seems to have persu@@ aded most mil@@ f fighters that the time has come to end the car@@ na@@ ge .
for the people of min@@ dan@@ ao , this is a life-@@ changing development .
in the few short months since the peace deal was reached , fili@@ pin@@ o and foreign investment has been flowing into the island .
with nearly half of min@@ dan@@ ao ’ s population living below the poverty line , these funds could not be more critical .
but the benefits of aqu@@ ino ’ s leadership are not limited to min@@ dan@@ ao .
his entire pres@@ iden@@ cy , which began in 2010 , has been characterized by the creativity and dog@@ ge@@ dness that made peace with the mil@@ f possible .
whereas other fili@@ pin@@ o leaders – including aqu@@ ino ’ s mother , cor@@ a@@ zon aqu@@ ino , who was elected president after mar@@ co@@ s ’ s over@@ throw – spoke out against corruption , aqu@@ ino has attacked it at its roots .
he has brought to justice not only small-@@ time wrong@@ do@@ ers – or “ flies , ” as chinese president x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping ’ s calls such people – but also “ tigers ” like senator juan pon@@ ce enri@@ le , who helped over@@ throw mar@@ co@@ s and bring cor@@ a@@ zon aqu@@ ino to power two decades ago .
as a result , the philippines has dramatically improved its ran@@ king in transparency international ’ s annual corruption index , rising from a 13@@ 4@@ th-@@ place tie with nigeria in 2010 , to 9@@ 4@@ th place , alongside india , last year .
aqu@@ ino ’ s efforts to fight corruption and rebuild his country ’ s economic foundations has enabled the philippines – at long last – to become southeast asia ’ s fa@@ ste@@ st-@@ growing economy , with annual gdp growth of 7.@@ 2 % last year .
while growth is expected to slow slightly this year , to 6.@@ 5 % , the philippines can now be counted among asia ’ s “ tiger ” economies .
of course , the country still has a long way to go .
some ten million fili@@ pin@@ os – one-@@ quarter of the workforce ­ – ­ are comp@@ elled to seek employment overseas , o@@ wing to inadequate opportunities at home .
if the philippines is to attract enough investment to achieve living standards comparable to malaysia and thailand , aqu@@ ino must remain persistent in his efforts to open the economy and cur@@ tail corruption .
fortunately , he seems determined to do so .
nowhere is this more apparent than in his willingness to stand up to china ’ s terri@@ torial claims in the south china sea .
aqu@@ ino ’ s stern criticism of china ’ s expan@@ sion@@ ist policies has certainly not ende@@ ared him to the chinese .
but regional powers like the united states and japan have supported his stance , with japan promising to deliver enhanced equipment for the philipp@@ ine coast guard .
and the fili@@ pin@@ o people und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly appreciate his ten@@ acity in protecting their interests .
aqu@@ ino ’ s success in bringing the dec@@ ad@@ es-@@ old mil@@ f rebellion to a peaceful end high@@ lights a courage and ten@@ acity that will enable him to play a key role in rein@@ ing in china ’ s regional ambi@@ tions .
just as david ’ s ingenuity enabled him , against all odds , to defeat goliath , aqu@@ ino ’ s bold and calculated leadership can succeed in bol@@ stering stability and security throughout asia by bringing china , perhaps against its will , into a rul@@ es-@@ based regional order .
japan ’ s russian dilemma
tokyo – for japanese leaders and citizens , president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin ’ s brutal an@@ nex@@ ation of cri@@ me@@ a was an uns@@ ur@@ prising return to the normal paradigm of russian history .
indeed , most japanese regard the move as having been determined by some expan@@ sion@@ ist gene in russia ’ s political dna , rather than by pu@@ tin himself or the specifi@@ cs of the ukra@@ ine crisis .
japan is particularly concerned with russian expan@@ sion@@ ism , because it is the only g-@@ 7 country that currently has a terri@@ torial dispute with russia , which has occupied its northern terri@@ tories since the wan@@ ing days of world war ii .
that occupation began between august 28 and september 5 , 1945 , when the soviet union hur@@ rie@@ dly nu@@ lli@@ fied the existing so@@ viet@@ -@@ japanese neutr@@ ality treaty and invaded not only japan@@ es@@ e-@@ occupied man@@ chu@@ ria , but also southern sa@@ khal@@ in island and the ancient japanese terri@@ tories of et@@ or@@ o@@ fu island , kun@@ as@@ hir@@ i island , shi@@ kot@@ an island , and the hab@@ o@@ mai islands .
concerned that america ’ s development and use of atomic weapons against japan would depri@@ ve the soviet union of any terri@@ torial gains in the east , stalin ordered the red army to invade .
but japan , having already en@@ du@@ red the bomb@@ ings of hiroshima and na@@ gas@@ ak@@ i , had accepted the po@@ ts@@ dam declar@@ ation on august 14 , meaning that the war was already over when the red army mar@@ ched in .
since then , these islands have been controlled by either the soviet union or its success@@ or state , russia .
and , as elsewhere in russia , their residents have been im@@ pover@@ ished by consistently in@@ competent and corrupt government , whether run by comm@@ uni@@ sts or today ’ s cr@@ ony capit@@ alists .
in a strange historical twist , given the cri@@ mean an@@ nex@@ ation , after the japanese citizens native to the northern terri@@ tories were killed or exp@@ elled , many ukra@@ ini@@ ans were brought to the islands during the soviet years , and still live there .
if an independence refer@@ end@@ um were to be held on et@@ or@@ o@@ fu island , where some 60 % of the inhabit@@ ants have roots in ukra@@ ine , i wonder whether pu@@ tin would accept the result as readily as he did the bal@@ lot in cri@@ me@@ a , under@@ taken at the barrel of a gun ?
after coming to power at the end of 2012 , japanese prime minister sh@@ in@@ z@@ o abe had sought to improve relations with pu@@ tin in the hope of beginning serious talks on the northern terri@@ tories .
but now that pu@@ tin has made his project of imperial restor@@ ation crystal clear , those hopes are still@@ born .
recognizing this , abe con@@ dem@@ ned the an@@ nex@@ ation of cri@@ me@@ a , calling it “ a viol@@ ation of ukra@@ ine ’ s integrity and the integrity of its sovereig@@ n@@ ty and territory . ”
abe added that “ attempts to change the status quo by force cannot be over@@ looked , ” and that japan would consider further economic san@@ ctions against russia in cooperation with the g-@@ 7 .
needless to say , these re@@ marks under@@ sc@@ ored the fact that japanese territory and terri@@ torial waters are being threatened “ by force ” in the east china sea by china .
the lesson now being drawn is that , where terri@@ torial dispu@@ tes are concerned , japan must not ko@@ w@@ to@@ w to “ attempts to change the status quo backed by force . ”
china ’ s response to the crisis in ukra@@ ine was particularly revealing .
for three decades , china has pro@@ cla@@ imed “ non-@@ interference ” in the internal affairs of sovereig@@ n states as the most important rule gover@@ ning international relations .
but when pu@@ tin invaded ukra@@ ine , china showed the hol@@ low@@ ness of its ad@@ her@@ ence to this principle .
instead of con@@ dem@@ ning russia for inv@@ ading and an@@ nex@@ ing cri@@ me@@ a , it ab@@ sta@@ ined at the united nations security council , and has offered more criticism of ukra@@ ine ’ s new popular government than it has of pu@@ tin ’ s th@@ ug@@ g@@ ish behavior .
every country in asia is bound to draw only one conclusion from china ’ s tac@@ it approval of pu@@ tin ’ s cri@@ mean land grab : china , too , thinks that might makes right , and if it believes that it can get away with inv@@ ading dispu@@ ted terri@@ tories , whether in the south china sea or in the indian himalayas , it will do so .
as a result , effective de@@ terr@@ ence will require asian countries to streng@@ then their defen@@ ses and unite to demand ad@@ her@@ ence to international law , so that china understands that any pu@@ tin@@ -@@ style land grabs will cost its economy de@@ arly .
in the immediate future , japan will work with the g-@@ 7 to ensure that pu@@ tin ’ s reck@@ less ambi@@ tions do not en@@ danger other parts of ukra@@ ine .
already , japan has decided to provide ¥ 150 billion ( $ 1.5 billion ) in economic aid for ukra@@ ine , the largest ple@@ dge by any individual country , including the us , thus far .
before the cri@@ me@@ a invasion , terri@@ torial negotiations between japan and russia showed signs of progress .
moreover , several bil@@ ateral economic cooperation efforts , such as projects involving li@@ que@@ fied natural gas , were moving forward .
but it is now clear not only that pu@@ tin is returning russia to the stag@@ nation of the lat@@ e-@@ soviet era , but also that he subscri@@ bes to former soviet leader leon@@ id bre@@ z@@ hne@@ v ’ s dic@@ tum that “ what we have , we hold . ”
so pu@@ tin ’ s talk about reaching an agreement with japan on the northern terri@@ tories was likely as mend@@ acious as his claims that russians in cri@@ me@@ a were in per@@ il , and thus in need of protection by russian troops .
more important , japan understands that business as usual with an aggressive russia that under@@ mines the international order could em@@ bol@@ den others closer to home to embrace pu@@ tin ’ s law@@ less tactics .
the days of an in@@ ward looking japan are over .
japan now sees threats elsewhere in the world in the context of its own security , and will react appropriately .
aben@@ om@@ ics ’ women problem
tokyo – when japanese prime minister sh@@ in@@ z@@ o abe addressed the united nations general assembly last week , he emphasi@@ zed his determination to build a society in which women shine .
indeed , creating opportunities for women in the workforce is an essential pill@@ ar of the government ’ s reform program , so-called “ aben@@ om@@ ics . ”
abe is clearly on the right track .
according to an analysis by researchers at goldman sachs , closing the gender gap could boost gdp by 9 % in the united states and nearly 13 % in japan .
during his stay in new york , abe also discussed “ w@@ omen@@ om@@ ics ” with hillary clinton , who had made empowering women in the economy a key policy goal during her ten@@ ure as us secretary of state .
abe , strange to say , is the first japanese leader to grasp that the under@@ utili@@ zation of women ’ s skills has been holding back japan ’ s economy .
japan ran@@ ked 10@@ 5@@ th out of 13@@ 6 countries in the world economic forum ’ s “ global gender gap report 2013 , ” down from 10@@ 1@@ st place in 2012 .
the problem begins in abe ’ s own domain – politics .
in his cabinet res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le earlier this month , five female ministers were ap@@ pointed , but in the face of strong opposition from male mps .
more important , the ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ments amo@@ unted to painting over the cracks : only 39 of the 4@@ 80 members of the japanese diet ’ s lower house , or 7.@@ 9 % , are women .
the inter-@@ parli@@ am@@ entary union ran@@ ks japan 15@@ 8@@ th out of 18@@ 9 countries in terms of its ratio of female mps .
things are just as bad at lower levels of government , where women account for a mere 13@@ .@@ 1 % of representatives in local parli@@ am@@ ents , more than 40 % of which have no female members at all .
as the leader of the liberal democratic party , abe should instru@@ ct local party branches to choose more female candidates to run in next april ’ s local elections .
but , at least so far , abe seems to lack the will to do so ( though he may choose to work with local party bos@@ ses behind the scenes to bring in more women ) .
it is also worrying that some of the women abe has selected for his cabinet and for key party posts are arch@@ -@@ conservatives who advocate that women stay at home and take care of children .
given this , one cannot help feeling un@@ certain about the credi@@ bility of his w@@ omen@@ om@@ ics initi@@ atives .
that is especially true when one consi@@ ders the lack of women in corporate management positions .
everyone at the meeting of the kei@@ dan@@ ren , the feder@@ ation of economic organizations , to welcome us ambassador caroline kennedy were men in dark suits .
in 2003 , norway re@@ vised its corporation law to state that companies that failed to place women in 40 % of management positions could face deli@@ sting .
if the same law were applied to japan today , every company would be deli@@ sted .
women currently hold an estimated 9 % of senior management positions in japan , compared to 40 % in the philippines , 24 % in france , and 22 % in the united states .
one reason that japan ’ s consumer electronics manufacturers are no longer world-@@ beat@@ ers is that they have not fully used their female employees in mana@@ geri@@ al positions , despite their varied experiences .
when ak@@ ira mat@@ su@@ mo@@ to became ceo of the japanese snack manufacturer cal@@ bee , he began ap@@ pointing both female execu@@ tives and foreig@@ ners to the company ’ s leadership .
revenues and ear@@ nings have increased , and net sales have grown thre@@ e@@ fold .
though there is no proof that the former caused the lat@@ ter , mat@@ su@@ mo@@ to ’ s commitment to lead in this area suggests that corporate dynam@@ ism may well increase with a more promin@@ ent role for women .
likewise , da@@ i@@ wa se@@ curi@@ ties ceo shi@@ ge@@ har@@ u su@@ zu@@ ki has ap@@ pointed women as executive officers to improve sales capabilities , with promising results .
although the employment rate of women in japan reached 6@@ 9.@@ 5 % in 2013 , more than 60 % of women leave the workplace pre@@ ma@@ tur@@ ely , mostly o@@ wing to child@@ birth .
this pattern results from institutional im@@ pedi@@ ments to achieving a viable wor@@ k-@@ family balance – im@@ pedi@@ ments that em@@ body the harsh view of male super@@ i@@ ors and colleagues toward working mothers .
changing this view is not easy , because the con@@ fu@@ cian belief that women belong in the home remains embedded in japanese and some other asian societies .
moreover , most of the people participating in for@@ ums or workshops focused on w@@ omen@@ om@@ ics are women ; too often , these events simply turn into platforms for women to complain among themselves .
abe ’ s w@@ omen@@ om@@ ics will not work unless and until japanese men change their thinking .
if aben@@ om@@ ics is now st@@ alling , as many fear , the reason may be found in a lack of capacity to implement the policies put forward , particularly with respect to women .
indeed , the key to aben@@ om@@ ics ’ success or failure may turn out to be whether the japanese people are convinced that women are essential to their country ’ s economic revi@@ val , and are willing to support an ear@@ nest effort to establish institutions that support working women .
tipping points to asia ’ s future
tokyo – a week , it is said , is a long time in politics .
but events in asia over the past week may define the region for decades to come .
thailand , one of asia ’ s most prosper@@ ous countries , seems determined to render itself a basket case .
a military coup , imposed following the thai constitu@@ tional court ’ s ou@@ ster of an elected government on spu@@ ri@@ ous legal grounds , can lead only to an artificial peace .
unless thailand ’ s military is prepared to serve as a truly honest bro@@ ker between de@@ posed prime minister y@@ ing@@ luck sh@@ in@@ a@@ wat@@ ra ( and her suppor@@ ters ) and the anti-@@ democratic bang@@ k@@ ok elite , which has sought a right to permanent minority rule , today ’ s calm may give way to a new and more dangerous storm .
to thailand ’ s east , vietnam is the latest asian country to feel pin@@ ched by china ’ s policy of creating facts on the ground , or in this case at sea , to enhance its sovereig@@ n@@ ty claims on dispu@@ ted territory .
vietnam ’ s government re@@ acted vi@@ gor@@ ously to china ’ s placement of a huge , explor@@ atory o@@ il@@ rig near the dispu@@ ted par@@ ac@@ el islands in the south china sea .
ordinary vietnamese , taking matters into their own hands , re@@ acted even more vi@@ gor@@ ously , by ri@@ oting and targe@@ ting chinese industrial investments for attack .
china ’ s un@@ il@@ ateral behavior has exposed a strain of virul@@ ent anti-@@ chinese senti@@ ment bub@@ bling beneath the surface in many asian countries .
rene@@ wed prote@@ sts over china ’ s mining investments in my@@ an@@ mar this week confir@@ med this trend , one that china ’ s leaders seem either to dis@@ miss as trivial , or to regard as somehow unrelated to their bull@@ ying .
indeed , like russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin , who faces widespread public anti@@ pathy in ukra@@ ine , china ’ s leaders appear to believe that popular prote@@ sts against them can only be the product of an american plot .
yet , despite their shared contemp@@ t for expressions of the popular will , china ’ s president x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping and pu@@ tin struggled , during pu@@ tin ’ s two-@@ day visit to shanghai , to agree on a new gas deal that the kre@@ m@@ lin desperately needs .
pu@@ tin had viewed china as his backup option should the west seek to isol@@ ate russia following its an@@ nex@@ ation of cri@@ me@@ a .
pu@@ tin ’ s idea was that he could pi@@ vo@@ t russia ’ s economy into a partnership with china .
but x@@ i bal@@ ked , signing the gas agreement only after pu@@ tin offered a ste@@ ep , long-term dis@@ count .
x@@ i ’ s self-@@ confidence reflected not only the chinese leadership ’ s contemp@@ t for pu@@ tin ’ s mis@@ management of the russian economy , but also the fact that china ’ s energy worries have l@@ essen@@ ed consider@@ ably of late .
successful deplo@@ yment of hydr@@ au@@ lic frac@@ turing ( “ fracking ” ) technology in x@@ inji@@ ang suggests that china , like america , will soon be able to draw on its own reserves of shal@@ e energy .
moreover , pl@@ enti@@ ful gas supplies from my@@ an@@ mar and central asia will provide china with sufficient supplies of energy for at least a decade .
china ’ s hard bar@@ gaining with russia has exposed the limits of the two countries ’ bil@@ ateral cooperation , which has important geo-@@ strategic consequences for asia and the world .
china , it now seems , is happy to see pu@@ tin poke his finger in the west ’ s eye and challenge america ’ s global leadership .
but it is not willing to under@@ write with hard cash russian preten@@ sions to world power status .
instead , china appears interested in turning russia into the sort of vas@@ sal state that pu@@ tin is seeking to create in ukra@@ ine .
but the most epo@@ ch@@ al events of the last week took place in two of asia ’ s great democracies : india and japan .
nar@@ en@@ dra mod@@ i ’ s land@@ slide victory in india ’ s general election was not only a huge personal triumph for the son of a tea seller , but may well mark a decisi@@ ve break with india ’ s traditional in@@ war@@ d-@@ looking policies .
mod@@ i is determined to reform india ’ s economy and lead the country into the front rank of world powers .
here , mod@@ i will find no sta@@ un@@ cher ally than japanese prime minister sh@@ in@@ z@@ o abe , who was among the first asian leaders to embrace him in his bid to lead india .
given that both countries have almost perfectly alig@@ ned regional security interests , there should be plenty of scope for the two to act in tan@@ dem to improve regional security and mutual prosperity .
thailand ’ s crisis might well mark a good early test of their ability to work together , because both countries have strong interests in thailand ’ s rapid return to democracy and the credi@@ bility needed to act as an honest bro@@ ker in ending the country ’ s crisis .
in the past week , abe created for himself consider@@ ably more political space to act as a strategic partner , not only to india , but also to japan ’ s other allies , particularly the united states .
quietly , a panel ap@@ pointed by abe ’ s government this week offered a rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ tation of a key element of article 9 of japan ’ s constitution .
for the first time since the pacific war ’ s end in 1945 , japan ’ s self-@@ defense forces would be able to participate in “ collective self-@@ defense ” – meaning that japan could come to the aid of its allies should they come under attack .
of course , china and others in asia have tried to mu@@ ddy this change with the al@@ arm@@ ist charge of a return to japanese milit@@ ar@@ ism .
but the new interpretation of article 9 au@@ gur@@ s just the opposite : it em@@ beds japan ’ s military within an alliance system that has been , and will remain , the back@@ bone of asia ’ s prevail@@ ing structure of peace .
abe will make this clear when he delivers the key@@ note address in singapore at this year ’ s sh@@ an@@ gr@@ i la dialogue , the annual meeting of asian military and civilian military leaders .
mod@@ i ’ s victory and abe ’ s increased ability to stand by japan ’ s allies can help to for@@ ge deeper bil@@ ateral ties and , if properly understood by china , foster a greater strategic equilibrium in the region .
it is now possible for asia ’ s greatest powers – china , india , japan , and the us – to form something ak@@ in to the concert system that gave europe a century of almost complete peace in the n@@ ine@@ te@@ enth century .
of course , such a system would require china to set aside its goal of regional he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y .
clear@@ -@@ sighted chinese must already see that , short of a victor@@ i@@ ous war , such dominance is impossible .
now is the moment for china to an@@ chor its rise within a stable and mutually acceptable asian regional order .
indeed , for china , this may be the ultimate tipping point in its moderni@@ zation .
the road to slo@@ v@@ y@@ ans@@ k
tokyo – the ukra@@ ine crisis has demonstrated that one person alone can en@@ danger world peace .
but that one person might not be russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin , who in reality only leads a large regional power that , o@@ wing to his authoritarian rule and mu@@ ddled economics , is a long-term threat more to itself than to the world .
no , the lone actor most responsible for threatening world peace might un@@ wi@@ tt@@ ingly be us president barack obama , with his schol@@ arly iner@@ tia and apparent dis@@ regard for the fate of smaller , far@@ away countries .
of course , obama is not responsible for russia ’ s invasion and an@@ nex@@ ation of cri@@ me@@ a , or for pu@@ tin ’ s mas@@ sing of russian troops on ukra@@ ine ’ s eastern border in an effort to intimi@@ date the government in k@@ yi@@ v .
nor is obama alone in cra@@ fting a western policy of appe@@ as@@ ement by default .
german chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a mer@@ kel also bears consider@@ able responsibility : her tough rhetoric masks a largely business-@@ as-@@ usual approach that reflects her country ’ s dependence on russian gas supplies .
but obama is responsible for his administration ’ s apparent in@@ difference to the fate of the americ@@ an-@@ built order that has governed world affairs since the end of world war ii .
unless he tough@@ ens his policies , the rules and norms that have guaranteed peace for so many for so long could lose their force .
the utter disconnect between america ’ s diplo@@ matic principles and practice has become so great that it is em@@ bol@@ dening the country ’ s adver@@ sar@@ ies .
that is why , following russia ’ s illegal sei@@ z@@ ure and an@@ nex@@ ation of cri@@ me@@ a , pu@@ tin is now trying to mold ukra@@ ine ’ s eastern provin@@ ces into vas@@ sal regions , if not f@@ om@@ ent irre@@ den@@ tism , in order to realize his dream of re@@ constitu@@ ting the russian empire .
the united states ’ closest allies are also watching nerv@@ ously , and the conclusions they appear to be drawing could harm its national security interests severely in the years and decades to come .
consider the middle east , where saudi arabia is already open@@ ly questioning the reli@@ ability of the kingdom ’ s historic us defense guarantee . and us secretary of state john kerry ’ s “ guidance ” for a settlement of the israeli@@ -@@ palestinian conflict , which should have been unvei@@ led this month , will now remain under wra@@ ps .
specu@@ lation abo@@ unded that kerry ’ s proposal would contain a specific us guarantee of israel ’ s borders .
but can anyone imagine israelis taking america at its word after watching the us di@@ ther while russia re@@ drew the map of ukra@@ ine ?
in the budapest memor@@ and@@ um of 1994 , the us , together with the united kingdom and russia , guaranteed ukra@@ ine ’ s terri@@ torial integrity in exchange for its sur@@ render of the large nuclear arsenal it inherited from the soviet union .
now that the us has dis@@ regarded its obligation to ukra@@ ine – repor@@ tedly un@@ willing even to share intelligence with its government on russian tro@@ op movements , much less supply the country with the means to defend itself – all be@@ ts are off concern@@ ing an american guarantee of israel ’ s security and terri@@ torial integrity .
for that matter , why should iran dis@@ continue its nuclear program when it sees the ease with which ukra@@ ine was dis@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed ?
after all , the iranians have borne far har@@ sher san@@ ctions than those imposed on russia so far .
by acqui@@ es@@ cing in russia ’ s sei@@ z@@ ure of cri@@ me@@ a , the us may also see core alli@@ ances begin to un@@ ra@@ vel .
for example , the us has open@@ ly stated that it will defend japan should china for@@ ci@@ bly sei@@ ze the dispu@@ ted sen@@ kak@@ u islands . but if america can ev@@ ade its guarantee of ukra@@ ine ’ s terri@@ torial integrity , why should japan ’ s leaders believe that it will do otherwise in the case of a far-@@ flung cluster of un@@ inhabited islands that are sc@@ arc@@ ely more than rocks inhabited by sheep ?
us secretary of defense chuck ha@@ gel heard an ear@@ ful of official doubt about the credi@@ bility of america ’ s defense commitment during his recent visit to japan .
obama is certain to hear more of the same in tokyo this week .
of course , the us is no longer in a position to “ pay any price … to secure the survival and the success of liberty , ” as john f@@ . kennedy put it in his in@@ augu@@ ral address – not in ukra@@ ine , and not anywhere else .
the huge price of its wars in afghanistan and iraq has understand@@ ably made the us war@@ -@@ we@@ ary .
moreover , no country has the right to expect americans to fight and die on its territory for its freedom .
but has the us become so with@@ drawn from the world that it is willing to pay only a symbolic price , such as that impli@@ ed by russia ’ s ti@@ t-@@ for-@@ tat san@@ ctions , to stop aggression that threat@@ ens the international order ?
have america ’ s recent foreign wars so scar@@ red its leaders that they are unable to defend the world order that their pre@@ de@@ cess@@ ors created and for which many americans have died ?
the time is growing short for the us to demonstrate ane@@ w – to friend and fo@@ e alike – that its word remains its bond .
unless russia hon@@ ors the accor@@ d recently reached in gen@@ eva to def@@ use the ukra@@ ine crisis , the us must use – and soon – its full arsenal of non-@@ military means to demonstrate to pu@@ tin the costs , and fol@@ ly , of his 19@@ 30 ’ s-@@ style re@@ van@@ ch@@ ism .
the soft under@@ belly of pu@@ tin ’ s imperial ambi@@ tions is russia ’ s bri@@ ttle and un@@ diversi@@ fied economy , and the expectations of ordinary russians for improved living standards .
the us and the european union need to demonstrate clearly to the russian people that their president ’ s policies will mean a likely return to the poverty and tyran@@ ny of the soviet era .
any lesser display of resolve may fat@@ ally wea@@ ken the bedro@@ ck of western security – and that of the world .
the py@@ on@@ gy@@ ang pur@@ ge
tokyo – during the cold war , the term “ kre@@ m@@ lin@@ ology ” referred to efforts to understand what was taking place at the command@@ ing heights of the soviet union – indeed , behind the entire iron cur@@ tain . kre@@ m@@ lin@@ ologists monit@@ ored ( in whatever way possible ) who was up and who was down among the core soviet leadership .
great significance was read into who signed an official document , or who stood where at@@ op len@@ in ’ s tom@@ b in red square when re@@ viewing military para@@ des .
all of that was gram@@ mar@@ -@@ school stuff compared to efforts to deci@@ ph@@ er the regime in north korea , where the truth is far more opaque .
consider what happened on december 17 .
cho@@ e ry@@ on@@ g-@@ ha@@ e , vice chair@@ man of the central military commission of the korean workers ’ party , was con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ously present on stage at the com@@ memor@@ ation of the second anniversary of “ dear leader ” kim jon@@ g-@@ il ’ s death – the first major ceremony following the pur@@ ge and execution of j@@ ang son@@ g-@@ tha@@ ek , the former vice chair@@ man of the national defense commission .
cho@@ e ’ s speech , with its threats against the united states and south korea , seemed to set the stage for his political elev@@ ation .
j@@ ang son@@ g-@@ tha@@ ek had been seen as a kind of reg@@ ent to kim jon@@ g-@@ un , the young success@@ or to the kim family dy@@ nasty , and was thought to be number two in the regime .
but he o@@ wed his position to his wife , kim ky@@ on@@ g-@@ hu@@ i , the only sister of kim jon@@ g-@@ il , kim jon@@ g-@@ un ’ s deceased father .
j@@ ang ’ s t@@ act , as well as his use@@ fulness as an inter@@ lo@@ cu@@ tor with china , enabled him to keep his position , despite his long-term separation from his wife .
but in north korea , blood is par@@ amount : everything , including ideology and the national interest , is sub@@ servi@@ ent to the maintenance of the kim dy@@ nasty .
the “ legacy ” of the “ great leader ” kim il-@@ sung and his son , “ dear leader ” kim jon@@ g-@@ il , determines all major decisions .
i have long believed that the true holder of power since kim jon@@ g-@@ il ’ s death has been his sister , kim ky@@ on@@ g-@@ hu@@ i , and no one else .
north korean culture would suggest that women do not take positions of leadership , but it appears that she was the only family member whom kim jon@@ g-@@ il could trust .
when he was in@@ capac@@ it@@ ated by illness , it was she who called the shots .
her blood tie to the kim dy@@ nasty is the reason why , even after her husband was pur@@ ged and executed ( and the rest of his family ro@@ unded up ) , she main@@ tained her political position .
it has even been suggested that she made the decision to pur@@ ge her husband .
though it cannot be known whether she also proposed killing him , it is not surprising that she believed that , with her own health failing , she could not leave the family dy@@ nasty to her husband ’ s care .
perhaps the most chil@@ ling aspect of j@@ ang ’ s execution is that it appears to be part of a feeding fren@@ zy that has cla@@ imed the lives of a number of senior officials and gener@@ als .
and the blood@@ letting has been extremely personal : in august , kim jon@@ g-@@ un repor@@ tedly ordered the execution by firing squ@@ ad of an ex-@@ girlfriend and other members of her musical ensemble ; the kill@@ ings are said to have been carried out in front of their families .
elsewhere in the communist world , such mur@@ der@@ ous pur@@ ges were ren@@ oun@@ ced long ago , first in the soviet union by k@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ che@@ v , following his den@@ un@@ ci@@ ation of stalin , and then in china by deng xia@@ oping , following his rehabilitation and return to power in the late 1970 ’ s .
this “ reform ” did not make these regimes any more bene@@ fi@@ cent or efficient , but it did bring a degree of stability and predic@@ tability to their behavior .
north korea , always the least predictable of total@@ itarian communist states , remains in a twi@@ light world .
more disturbing is the question of whether china is going down a parallel path under president x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping .
ever since deng ’ s rule , there has been an understanding that members of the chinese communist party ’ s poli@@ t@@ bur@@ o are not to be touched , even in retirement .
but x@@ i , under the pre@@ text of his anti-@@ corruption battle , has targeted retired poli@@ t@@ bur@@ o member zhou y@@ ong@@ kan@@ g , who is now repor@@ tedly under house arrest , facing gra@@ ft charges – and lu@@ rid alle@@ ga@@ tions not only that he murdered his first wife but that he tried to ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ate x@@ i .
china ’ s emphasis since deng on rule by consensus may not have made the country any more democratic , but it at least prevented the re-@@ emergence of a new cult of personality à la mao ze@@ d@@ ong .
the question today is whether x@@ i ’ s fl@@ ou@@ ting of this internal party convention is another step in re-@@ creating one-@@ man – and thus completely arbitrary – rule in china .
in north korea , of course , arbitrary rule – no matter how bizarre and ine@@ pt – is always the norm .
and now , with j@@ ang pur@@ ged , responsibility for economic failure in north korea has been shifted to cho@@ e .
all officials and people related to him now live under the shadow of the execu@@ tion@@ er , for he is certain to bear the blame when the dy@@ nasty needs a sc@@ ape@@ goat for its moun@@ ting problems .
and j@@ ang ’ s pur@@ ge may make those problems worse .
while china lost a convenient point of contact with the kim regime , north korea may have lost the only channel by which to sustain itself .
the economy cannot be revi@@ ved so long as international san@@ ctions are main@@ tained , and the san@@ ctions seem certain to remain in place so long as the regime continues with its nuclear brin@@ k@@ man@@ ship .
china , which has been the kim dy@@ nasty ’ s lifel@@ ine , no longer appears willing to offer it a blank check .
so the day is fast approaching when kim jon@@ g-@@ un and his cl@@ an will have to take responsibility for the country ’ s di@@ re condition , and it may come soon after kim ky@@ on@@ g-@@ hu@@ i dies .
if so , the kim dy@@ nasty ’ s last chapter may have begun with the current sp@@ as@@ m of execu@@ tions , though the ending – for the korean pen@@ insu@@ la and east asia alike – remains very much in doubt .
the new neutr@@ ality
tokyo – throughout the cold war , the soviet union used every imagin@@ able threat and in@@ duc@@ ement – including the ultimate prize of re@@ uni@@ fication – to bring about a neutral germany .
but german leaders of both the left and the right , from kon@@ rad aden@@ au@@ er to wil@@ ly brand@@ t , spur@@ ned every soviet offer .
will authoritarian mer@@ can@@ tili@@ sm now succeed where communism failed ?
countries join alli@@ ances , or entities such as the european union , because these groups make the benefits and obli@@ ga@@ tions of mem@@ ber@@ ship as un@@ ambiguous as anything in international relations can be .
for germany and south korea , however , relationships with historic allies – nato and the united states , respe@@ ctively – appear to be changing before our eyes .
through their huge purch@@ ases of goods , with promises of even more to come , today ’ s authoritarian / mer@@ can@@ ti@@ list regimes in russia and china may be about to achieve by commerce what the so@@ vie@@ ts could not achieve by bri@@ bery and threats .
and the scale of that commerce is breath@@ taking , with german exports to china growing from $ 25@@ .@@ 9 billion a decade ago to $ 8@@ 7.@@ 6 billion in 2011 , while south korea ’ s exports have increased from $ 53 billion to $ 13@@ 3 billion during the same period of time .
a form of ste@@ al@@ th neutr@@ alism , indeed , appears to be entering both countries ’ diplomacy .
witness chinese president x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping ’ s recent trip to south korea , german chan@@ cell@@ or angel@@ a mer@@ kel ’ s un@@ willingness to impose effective san@@ ctions on russia for its intervention in ukra@@ ine , and the business-@@ only focus of her ju@@ st-@@ concluded visit to china .
in both germany and south korea , the idea that historic alli@@ ances may offer fewer tangible benefits than tac@@ it neutr@@ ality – particularly in terms of exports – appears to be taking root , especially among business elites .
x@@ i ’ s visit to seoul was another bold step in china ’ s systematic efforts to we@@ an south korea from its commitment to the us-@@ led international economic order .
by offering to per@@ mit south korea to settle its bil@@ ateral trade accounts in ren@@ min@@ bi , and to launch the first-@@ ever sin@@ o-@@ south korean initiative toward north korea , x@@ i is seeking to convince south korea ’ s leaders that the country ’ s future , including re@@ uni@@ fication , will be determined in beijing .
china ’ s invitation to south korea to participate in a new asian infrastructure investment bank ( alongside other countries in asia and the arab world , but exclu@@ ding japan and india ) fur@@ thers x@@ i ’ s efforts to create an alternative financial system , with the ai@@ ib mimi@@ cking the asia development bank ’ s work .
china ’ s embrace of south korea is part of a long-term strategy to turn it into a sub@@ ordin@@ ate state in terms of foreign and national security policy ( much as finland ko@@ w@@ to@@ wed to the soviet union throughout the cold war ) .
and yet , though cour@@ ted by all sides in the struggle to maintain stability in northeast asia , south korea now runs the risk of becoming isolated .
every gesture by the south toward one of the protag@@ onists – china , the us , japan , and north korea – e@@ lic@@ its so much pressure by the others that its government must then somehow dev@@ ise a compen@@ sat@@ ory policy .
for example , following president park ge@@ un-@@ hy@@ e ’ s request that x@@ i honor the korean ass@@ as@@ sin of a japanese prime minister , to which x@@ i readily agreed , she began to discuss joining the us-@@ led trans@@ -@@ pacific partnership free-@@ trade negotiations , in order to assu@@ age the us .
as china continued to pursue an anti-@@ japanese propaganda campaign throughout 2013 , park felt obli@@ ged to make some effort to revi@@ ve ties with japan by sending a private en@@ vo@@ y to prime minister sh@@ in@@ z@@ o abe to seek talks on re@@ conc@@ iling their dispu@@ tes .
given its inse@@ curity , a by-@@ product of the korean pen@@ insu@@ la ’ s long division , south korea requires , above all , calm and steady partners .
but frequent changes in us policy toward northeast asia in recent years have dis@@ oriented south korean policymakers , while chinese policy , though consistent , confron@@ ts south korea ’ s leaders with choices that they appear un@@ prepared to make .
as a result , south korea ’ s elite appears to be spli@@ tting into pro-@@ chinese and pro-@@ american fac@@ tions that transcend party lines .
over a period of time , the only bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ aries are likely to be those who call for “ fin@@ lan@@ di@@ zation ” of the korean pen@@ insu@@ la .
meanwhile , the impact on german foreign policy of the country ’ s dee@@ pen@@ ing economic ties with russia has been evident throughout the ukra@@ ine crisis .
though mer@@ kel frequently ad@@ mon@@ ished the kre@@ m@@ lin about its intervention in ukra@@ ine , german public opinion – particularly that of the country ’ s business leaders – tied her hands .
indeed , german big businesses have been the main obstacle to im@@ posing the type of systemic san@@ ctions that might have dis@@ su@@ aded russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir pu@@ tin from an@@ nex@@ ing cri@@ me@@ a and continuing to back the insur@@ gency ( which russia itself inc@@ ited ) in eastern ukra@@ ine .
this is not the only recent case in which germany has distan@@ ced itself from its allies and partners .
in libya in 2011 , germany refused to offer even ru@@ di@@ mentary material support to the military intervention sta@@ ged by its british and french allies .
germany has also continuously failed to meet its commitment to spend 2 % of its gdp on defense , at the same time that it has insisted that troubled eu economies stick to au@@ ster@@ ity budgets that limit their defic@@ its to a fixed proportion of their economic output .
indeed , throughout the euro@@ zone crisis , germany did the absolute minimum – and always at the last possible moment – to ass@@ ist its eu partners .
and german leaders ’ obsession with maintaining their country ’ s “ golden decade ” of exports appears to have gag@@ ged them on topics like china ’ s human rights ab@@ uses and its aggressive behavior toward its asian neighbors .
that silence is being rewar@@ ded with the first-@@ ever joint cabinet sessions between a democracy and a communist dictator@@ ship , which will take place in berlin this au@@ tum@@ n .
in both germany and south korea , economic strength seems to have produced an illusion of policy independence that is opening a ch@@ as@@ m between the two countries and their allies – a ch@@ as@@ m that revel@@ ations of us sp@@ ying , on mer@@ kel in particular , have dee@@ pen@@ ed .
germany and south korea , however , will gain little , and risk much , if they down@@ grade their alliance ties in favor of commer@@ cially motivated , if un@@ official , neutr@@ ality .
whatever short-term benefits they receive will be more than off@@ set by their strategic vulner@@ abilities vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis russia and china .
ending east asia ’ s history wars
tokyo – geor@@ ges cle@@ men@@ ce@@ au , who , as france ’ s prime minister , led his country to victory in world war i , famously said that “ war is too important to be left to the gener@@ als . ”
japan is now discovering that history is too important to be left to newspaper editors .
in the 1990s , the newspaper as@@ a@@ hi shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n caused a fire@@ storm at home and in south korea by publishing a series of articles , based upon testimony by the former japanese soldier sei@@ ji yo@@ shi@@ da , on “ comfort women ” – kore@@ ans forced to provide sexual services to the japanese imperial army during world war ii .
as@@ a@@ hi has now ad@@ mitted that the soldier ’ s conf@@ essions were un@@ founded , and has dis@@ avo@@ wed the core supporting evidence for the articles .
that re@@ tra@@ ction appears to be causing as much embarras@@ sment – and diplo@@ matic vi@@ tri@@ ol – in japan and south korea today as the original series did .
but , at a time when both countries cannot afford to per@@ mit partisan or slo@@ ppy ab@@ uses of history to ro@@ il their bil@@ ateral relations , as@@ a@@ hi ’ s car@@ eless work has turned out to be more than aby@@ s@@ mal journalism ; it has introduced a dangerous element into regional diplomacy .
some say that japan and south korea should follow the example set by france and germany .
re@@ conc@@ iling in the first two decades following the nazi occupation of france , these countries ’ leaders understood that their security and economic ties were far too important to their citizens ’ well@@ being to allow the old hat@@ re@@ ds to fester .
they knew that the unimaginable violence of w@@ wi@@ i was a direct result of the an@@ tag@@ on@@ is@@ ms that had fe@@ stered since the na@@ po@@ le@@ onic wars and that were allowed to persist after 1918 .
in charles de gau@@ lle and kon@@ rad aden@@ au@@ er , france and germany had two of the twen@@ tieth century ’ s greatest stat@@ es@@ men , leaders who were able to disc@@ ern the broad swe@@ ep of history through the fog of qu@@ o@@ ti@@ dian politics .
their loyalty was not only to the citizens who elected them , but also to the generations of the past that had en@@ du@@ red the consequences of fran@@ co-@@ german en@@ mity , and to generations yet to come , which would benefit from reconciliation .
of course , given that japan and korea have not fought a series of wars against each other , their relationship is not the same as that between germany and france .
but it is clear that no one will benefit from a new round of heated historical debate .
to avoid this , political leaders like de gau@@ lle and aden@@ au@@ er are needed .
only when we can discuss the past without endanger@@ ing the future will the countries of northeast asia be able to establish a truly durable structure of peace .
as admi@@ ral dennis c. blair , a former commander of the us pacific fleet , stated at a recent conference , “ the history of asia from the 1930s to about 195@@ 5 or so was not pretty in any way … .@@ i don ’ t think any country can have a monopoly on righ@@ te@@ ousness , or on guilt and shame ” for that time .
blair added that “ the attempt to hold a ‘ we were right ’ and ‘ you were wrong ’ swee@@ p@@ stakes is not going to help our children and grandchildren understand what happened there . ”
japan and south korea need to take responsibility for the future , not obs@@ ess about the past .
a recent japanese government white paper called south korea the country “ that shares the closest relationship with japan historically and in areas such as economy and culture . ” no doubt , many , if not most , south korean foreig@@ n-@@ policy experts and strategi@@ sts share that senti@@ ment .
but it will take committed leadership to transcend the history wars and tap the full potential of japan@@ es@@ e-@@ korean cooperation , something that both countries ’ key ally , the united states , strongly desires , as it see@@ ks to draw china into a lasting and peaceful asian order .
for too long , in@@ temper@@ ate historical deb@@ ates – often driven by biased newspaper accounts – have pois@@ oned bil@@ ateral relations .
now , as another war of words he@@ ats up , japanese and south korean leaders need to step back , recognize where the real interests of their people lie , both today and in the future , and cal@@ m@@ ly begin to take the measures required to ensure durable reconciliation .
the en@@ ig@@ ma of european defense
paris – while europe ’ s citizens largely support the establishment of a common security and defense policy , most european leaders have demonstrated a clear lack of interest in creating one – including at last month ’ s european council meeting .
what accounts for this paradox ?
one possible explanation is that financially stra@@ ined european governments lack the means to fulfill their citizens ’ expectations .
but that is un@@ convincing , given that the issue was fra@@ med in almost identical terms three decades ago , when bud@@ ge@@ tary constraints were not a problem .
in fact , it could be argued that such constraints should spur , not im@@ pe@@ de , the creation of a european defense structure .
after all , member countries would then be able to pool their resources , harmon@@ ize programs , and ration@@ alize costs , thereby reducing individual governments ’ financial burden .
another , far more credible explanation is that europeans ’ interpre@@ tations of “ a more active and stronger security policy ” differ widely .
indeed , current discussions in europe concern@@ ing the use of force are dominated by three main perspectives , champi@@ oned by france , the united kingdom , and germany .
france , which has once again interven@@ ed in africa – this time to restore order in the central african republic – is the only european union country that seems genuinely interested in satisfying popular demand for more robust european security structures .
the french consider europe to be a kind of superpower – a status that impli@@ es a corresponding military capacity .
while this view probably ste@@ ms from france ’ s historical political and military pro@@ w@@ ess , it also reflects the country ’ s current interests .
as europe ’ s greatest military power ( despite the uk ’ s larger defense budget ) , france would play a key role in any wide-@@ ranging european military operation .
the uk , for its part , shares france ’ s belief that military power is a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ isi@@ te to strategic effectiveness .
it claims that its opposition to a european defense structure ste@@ ms from its belief that nato – and thus the united states – is critical to european defense .
but , given that no other eu country has seriously considered exclu@@ ding nato , this argument seems to be little more than an excuse .
the truth is that the only kind of defense the british accept is that conducted by a coalition of european states acting under their national flags , as occurred in libya .
in the uk ’ s view , “ european ” operations should be limited to humanitarian and peace@@ keeping obje@@ ctives .
while it supported the fight against pi@@ racy off the horn of africa , that was more a policing operation than a military one , and it was guided by a shared interest in protecting trade rou@@ tes from the middle east and asia .
germany ’ s vision of european defense is very different from the french and british perspectives .
unlike the uk , germany supports a european security and defense policy , prou@@ dly high@@ lighting its consistent military budget and major presence in european missions ( larger than that of the over@@ stretched french ) .
and , though germany shares the uk ’ s belief that nato bears primary responsibility for protecting europe , its view of european engagement is even more restri@@ ctive .
in germany ’ s view , european military intervention should be limited to the continent , and should not include combat operations .
in fact , a majority of europe ’ s citizens prefer that european forces be deployed only for non-@@ combat missions .
and , so far , virtually all european military operations have been aimed at ev@@ acu@@ ating european nation@@ als , delivering humanitarian aid , or maintaining peace in the after@@ math of conflict .
these differ@@ ing views explain the uncertainty surrounding france ’ s recent interventions in africa .
the french have lam@@ ented the min@@ is@@ cule support offered by the rest of europe for its operations in mal@@ i and the central african republic – exem@@ pli@@ fied by germany ’ s ref@@ us@@ al to create a fund for eu mem@@ ber-@@ state operations .
but , given the urgency of the situations in libya , mal@@ i , and the central african republic , this lack of support has not under@@ min@@ ed france ’ s efforts as much as prior consul@@ tation with european leaders would have done .
had the ger@@ mans been consul@@ ted , they probably would have rejected the interventions anyway .
this conflict between the need for rapid response and the requirement for deliber@@ ation explains why the eu ’ s mu@@ ch-@@ discussed “ battle@@ groups ” are unlikely ever to be deployed .
the fact that most europeans are satisfied with limited political and military involvement outside of europe makes increased defense cooperation even less likely .
a pessi@@ mist would say that europeans are unable – or at least un@@ willing – to rethink their defense policy , because the us ultimately en@@ sures their security through nato .
according to this view , france ’ s efforts to encourage both trans@@ atlantic integration and autonomous political action are in@@ sufficient to change most europeans ’ minds .
a more optimistic interpretation is that europe needs defense structures that account for the role of member states – not just for that of the eu .
from this perspective , europe does have a significant military presence , whether in afghanistan and libya or mal@@ i and the central african republic .
that is a start .
a zero-@@ carbon economy is within reach
beijing – when the paris climate agreement was concluded in december 2015 , almost all the world ’ s countries committed to limit global warming to well below 2 ° celsius relative to pre-@@ industrial levels , and have submitted “ intended nation@@ ally determined contributions ” ( ind@@ cs ) describing how they will either contain or reduce emissions over the next decade .
global investment in renewable power now far exce@@ eds investment in fossil fuel plants ; battery costs are falling , and electric vehicle sales rising ; and even in president don@@ ald trum@@ p ’ s america , co@@ al-@@ fired power stations continue to close .
but despite this progress , the latest report from the inter@@ governmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) contains a chil@@ ling prediction : on current trends , the world is heading toward 3 ° c of global warming by 2100 , to a level not reached for more than a million years .
the harm to human welfare is likely to be catastrophic .
the ipcc report makes it clear that the ideal target should be to limit warming to 1.5 ° c. above that level , the ad@@ verse consequences become ever more extreme .
but to achieve that goal , global carbon dioxide emissions would have to reach net zero by about 20@@ 55 , and still earlier if , as is unfortunately inevitable , emissions remain at current levels for several more years .
the precise implications for acceptable emissions from power stations , industrial plants , transport networks , and heating systems depend on how rapidly emissions caused by land@@ -@@ use change such as deforestation can be eliminated , and how rapidly emissions of non-@@ co2 greenhouse gases ( for example , methane or ni@@ tr@@ ous oxide ) can be reduced .
but it ’ s clear that unless we get to net zero emissions from energy use and industry by around 20@@ 60 – and earlier in developed economies – we will have to rely on the risky assumption that land@@ -@@ use changes can deliver large negative emissions in the late twenty-@@ first century .
failing that , warming will rise significantly above 1.5 ° c .
getting to net zero emissions in just four decades will be a huge challenge .
but as a for@@ th@@ coming report from the energy transi@@ tions commission argues , the good news is that it is und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly technically possible , and at an accep@@ tably low cost to the global economy .
moreover , we already know the key technologies we need to achieve this objective .
all feasi@@ ble paths to a low-@@ carbon economy and , eventually , net zero co2 emissions require a massive increase in the role of electricity .
the share of electricity in final energy demand will have to grow from around 20 % today to around 60 % by mid- to late century , and total global electricity generation will have to rise dramatically , from around 25,000 tw@@ h today to as much as 100,000 tw@@ h .
that electricity must come from low-@@ carbon sources .
and while nuclear power and gas generation off@@ set by carbon capture may play a role , the lion ’ s share will have to come from renewable sources – 70-@@ 80 % in the ipcc ’ s scenarios .
but there is plenty enough land in the world to support renewable expansion on that scale , and enough time to make the necessary investments as long as we act fast .
three other sets of technologies will also be essential .
first , hydrogen , am@@ mon@@ ia , and perhaps methan@@ ol must be used as energy carri@@ ers in transport and industrial applications and as chemical feed@@ stock inputs .
all three will eventually be produced synthe@@ tically , using clean electricity as the ultimate energy source .
second , biomass could provide low-@@ carbon aviation fuel , or feed@@ stock for plastics production .
the total scale of use , however , will need to be carefully managed to avoid harmful impacts on ecosystems and food supply .
third , there should be at least some role for carbon capture , and either storage or use , in key industrial processes such as cement production , where viable alternative rou@@ tes to de@@ carbon@@ ization are currently un@@ available .
building a zero-@@ carbon economy will of course require massive investment in power production and transmission , new industrial plants , and more efficient equipment .
to achieve the 1.5 ° c objective , the ipcc estimates that the required additional global investment , from 2015 to 2050 , could be $ 900 billion per ann@@ um .
that may seem like a start@@ l@@ ingly high figure ; but , assuming 3 % annual economic growth , global gdp , which stands at almost $ 100 trillion today , could reach $ 2@@ 60 trillion by 2050 .
this impli@@ es that the world needs to invest less than 0.@@ 6 % of its income over the next four decades to avoid potentially catastrophic harm to human welfare .
china alone currently invest@@ s more than $ 5 trillion each year , a significant proportion of which is wasted on the construction of apartment blocks which will never be occupied in cities which face static and eventually declining populations .
by re@@ direc@@ ting investment , china could build a zero-@@ carbon economy without any sacrifice of consumption .
for the world as a whole , the impact on living standards of achieving net zero emissions will be trivial .
but while a zero-@@ carbon economy is und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly technically feasi@@ ble and easily affordable , it will not be achieved without strong public policies and for@@ war@@ d-@@ looking business strategies .
governments must deliver carbon pricing and product regulation and support key technologies and infra@@ structures , and companies in the energy-@@ producing and main energy-@@ using sectors must develop strategies focused on how to achieve zero emissions by mid-@@ century and how to begin the transition today .
the alternative is another decade of only incremental progress , which will put us on a catastrophic path toward 3 ° c warming within the lifetime of today ’ s children .
z@@ hu ron@@ g@@ ji re@@ examined
as china &apos;s new leadership team emerges , the world &apos;s attention has focused on president ji@@ ang z@@ em@@ in &apos;s success@@ or .
but this is mis@@ guided , for perhaps the most significant moment in china &apos;s recent history of boom and transformation was the 1998 appointment of z@@ hu ron@@ g@@ ji ( pronoun@@ ced &quot; jo@@ o ron@@ g-@@ je@@ e &quot; ) as premi@@ er of the state council , a position once held by deng xia@@ oping .
given the obvious importance of the post in recent years , the choice of mr. z@@ hu &apos;s replacement may be of even more significance than president ji@@ ang &apos;s de@@ par@@ ture from center stage .
even before he became premi@@ er , mr. z@@ hu , as the president of china &apos;s central bank , was known as the architect of china &apos;s 8 % annual economic growth in the 1990s and the master@@ mind of its successful fight against inflation .
mr. z@@ hu has been china &apos;s jack welch , the tough@@ -@@ minded , long@@ time ceo of the american con@@ gl@@ om@@ er@@ ate general electri@@ c-@@ -@@ a man celebrated for his cand@@ or , his global sophistication , and his insi@@ stence on performance .
indeed , mr. z@@ hu was ren@@ owned for pun@@ ishing those who fell short of his expectations .
as mayor of shanghai , he once discipl@@ ined his tourist bureau officials by making them scru@@ b the city &apos;s public toilets themselves .
a few months after his appointment as premi@@ er , mr. z@@ hu delivered his &quot; three promises &quot; speech , in which he ple@@ dged to make three bold moves to secure a more vibrant , self-@@ sustaining economy .
first , he would over@@ haul the 300,000 state-@@ run national corporations that still conducted an overwhelming amount of china &apos;s business and accoun@@ ted for the bulk of its economic activity .
more than 70 % of such companies were un@@ profitable and were pro@@ pped up by government subsi@@ dy .
just as mr. welch promised to &quot; fix , close , or sell &quot; non@@ performing di@@ visions of general electric when he took over the company , mr. z@@ hu threatened to fire chief execu@@ tives of chinese firms that lost money for more than two con@@ secu@@ tive years , and then either to shut them down or sell them .
this forced national corporations to be priva@@ tized and go public or to be over@@ seen by provin@@ cial governments , a change that proved to be a major im@@ pe@@ tus for a sudden de@@ centr@@ alization of china &apos;s governance struc@@ ture-@@ -@@ another key legacy of mr. z@@ hu &apos;s ten@@ ure .
second , mr. z@@ hu said he would wipe out the many bad deb@@ ts of china &apos;s banks and &quot; international trust companies . &quot;
many of these had contributed to a so@@ f@@ ten@@ ing in china &apos;s economy by routinely len@@ ding money to in@@ sol@@ vent corporations .
at the time , there were 2@@ 45 such trust companies , which had such a poor record of re@@ payment that overseas investors were beginning to shu@@ n china entirely .
re@@ forming them would take 10 years , he said .
third , mr. z@@ hu said he would stream@@ line the central government and take on one of china &apos;s most per@@ ni@@ cious problems : high-@@ level corruption in government agencies .
he would propose measures including , for example , cutting links between government and organized crime , and making it more difficult for bureau@@ crats to accept bribes .
politicians often make bold promises but rarely keep them .
on july 1 , 2001 , at the celebration of the 80@@ th anniversary of the chinese communist party , mr. z@@ hu ass@@ essed his progress .
his app@@ rais@@ al of his record in office is not@@ ably accurate , and stands as a convincing testam@@ ent to the effectiveness of his leadership .
mr. z@@ hu told the assembled communist leadership that he had fulfilled the first promise : many of china &apos;s public corporations had become profitable private entities or had been shut down .
those that were still operating were given string@@ ent profit@@ ability targets , were allowed to choose the people they hired , and were encouraged to raise money on private stock ex@@ changes , which effectively propelled them into the private sector as &quot; red chip &quot; corporations .
as for the second promise , more than 50 heads of financial institutions had at that point been fired ( more followed ) , and reforms had changed the investment climate dramatically .
instead of fle@@ eing the country , capital was flowing in more rapidly than ever before .
mr. z@@ hu &apos;s record concern@@ ing his third promise was more mixed .
while the size of the central government fell dramatically , with employment at the state council hal@@ ved from 3@@ 4,000 to 17@@ ,000 , corruption continued to fester .
despite mr. z@@ hu &apos;s efforts , opposition from vest@@ ed interests throughout the govern@@ ment-@@ -@@ particularly at the highest le@@ vel@@ s-@@ -@@ im@@ pe@@ ded reform .
nonetheless , z@@ hu ron@@ g@@ ji &apos;s reforms created the kind of level playing field and rule of law on which a vibrant capit@@ alist system depends .
that is a political legacy second to none in modern chinese history .
zi@@ ka and reproductive rights
new york – mosquit@@ oes know no boundaries , and neither does fear .
as publi@@ c-@@ health experts gra@@ pple with the zi@@ ka virus , panic continues to spread around the world .
yet the crisis has brought to light two important truths .
the first revelation is how badly degraded public health systems have become , across latin america and beyond .
this did not happen by chance .
in large part , it is the result of pressure on developing countries by conc@@ essi@@ on@@ ary len@@ ders , such as the international mon@@ etary fund , to cut social sector expen@@ ses , including health spending , beginning in 1980 .
in brazil and elsewhere , state authorities could have deployed well-known and cost-@@ effective measures to control mosquit@@ o-@@ borne diseases , but they did not .
their most affected citizens , who tend to be poor , have been forced to live with the consequences .
second , the zi@@ ka epidemic has revealed , with particular po@@ ig@@ nancy , another di@@ re threat to public health : the denial of women ’ s reproductive rights .
governments are shir@@ king their responsibility in this regard too , often in a gro@@ tes@@ que manner .
the reported spike in cases of micro@@ cephal@@ y – a birth defe@@ ct – among infants in zi@@ ka-@@ affected areas led the governments of brazil , colom@@ bia , ecuador , and el sal@@ v@@ ad@@ or to warn their female citizens “ not to become pregnant . ”
this message , which places the blame and burden of the zi@@ ka epidemic on women , is as un@@ just as it is un@@ reasonable .
it is also tooth@@ less , as many women in the region do not have access to contra@@ ception or safe abor@@ tions .
the zi@@ ka crisis has high@@ ligh@@ ted an obvious reality : not providing women with reproductive health information and services places their lives – and those of their children – at grave risk .
latin america ’ s abor@@ tion laws are among the world ’ s most restri@@ ctive .
el sal@@ v@@ ad@@ or , for example , b@@ ans abor@@ tion in all circumstances and has incarcer@@ ated women who have gone to emergency rooms after mis@@ carri@@ ages , charging them with seeking illegal abor@@ tions .
contra@@ ception can also be expensive or difficult to access across the region , despite high rates of teenage rape and pregnancy .
the result , especially with the addition of the zi@@ ka virus , is a recipe for tragedy .
brazil , the latin american country hit hardest by the virus so far , is em@@ ble@@ matic of the problem : abor@@ tion is allowed only in cases of rape , danger to the woman ’ s life , or in the case of fe@@ tal an@@ en@@ cephal@@ y ( the absence of a major portion of the brain ) .
in response to the zi@@ ka crisis , brazil should immediately allow abor@@ tion in cases of suspected micro@@ cephal@@ y as well .
the loo@@ sen@@ ing of restri@@ ctions , however , should not stop there .
over the last few years , conservatives in the brazilian congress have been trying to place limits on abor@@ tion in cases of rape .
these efforts – which demonstrate complete dis@@ regard for the rights and dignity of women – must end .
instead , women ’ s right to seek an abor@@ tion should be expanded – and quickly .
governments must also ensure that services are accessible and affordable .
wealthy brazilian women can afford to pay private health providers for safe abor@@ tions .
poor women are forced to resort to poorly trained and equipped providers who operate in uns@@ an@@ it@@ ary conditions , sometimes as part of criminal networks .
in september 20@@ 14 , two women died in rio de jan@@ ei@@ ro following c@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine abor@@ tions .
in the region overall , 95 % of abor@@ tions are un@@ safe .
in latin america and the caribbean , 62 % of women aged 15-@@ 49 want to avoid a pregnancy .
expense is only one barrier for poor women and girls ; another is the lack of information .
men and women need comprehensive sexuality education , so they are informed about their reproductive health and family planning options and know where they can get modern contra@@ cep@@ tives .
recent evidence suggesting that zi@@ ka might be transmitted sexually adds extra urgency to making male and female condoms and other contra@@ cep@@ tives widely available .
the movement for reproductive rights has a long history in brazil and in other parts of latin america .
over the last several months – even before zi@@ ka – femini@@ sts had been taking to the streets in ou@@ trage at the lack of access to safe and legal abor@@ tions .
the zi@@ ka crisis may mark a turning point in the fight for women ’ s health and equality .
it is certainly a wa@@ ke@@ -up call for governments everywhere to rebuild and streng@@ then public health systems , and to guarantee all women and girls access to contra@@ cep@@ tives and safe abor@@ tions .
women and girls around the world know the alternative – and it is terrifying .
the inju@@ st@@ ices of zi@@ ka
south@@ am@@ p@@ ton – out@@ breaks of communic@@ able diseases in the developing world are bad enough from a health perspective .
but they also have serious implications for social justice , because they exac@@ erb@@ ate long@@ standing human-@@ rights crises , including by under@@ mining al@@ read@@ y-@@ weak publi@@ c-@@ services pro@@ vision and dee@@ pen@@ ing existing ine@@ qualities .
like the 20@@ 14 ebola outbreak in west africa , the zi@@ ka outbreak in central and south america in 2015 hit vulnerable social groups – women and children , ethnic min@@ orities , and the poor – the hardest .
like yellow fever , dengue , and other diseases , zi@@ ka is transmitted by ae@@ des a@@ egyp@@ ti mosquit@@ oes .
but , un@@ usually for a mosquit@@ o-@@ borne virus , zi@@ ka can also be transmitted sexually .
even more unusual , it is associated with neurological and developmental conditions affecting babies : micro@@ cephal@@ y and guil@@ la@@ in-@@ bar@@ r@@ é syndrome .
otherwise , its symptoms are often rather mild .
this means that , of the more than 1.5 million people stri@@ cken by zi@@ ka since the outbreak , the consequences were most worrying for women of chil@@ d-@@ bearing age , especially those who were already pregnant .
between 20@@ 16 and 20@@ 17 , a total of 1@@ 1,@@ 0@@ 59 zi@@ ka cases in pregnant women were confir@@ med , producing 10@@ ,@@ 8@@ 67 cases of micro@@ cephal@@ y and other con@@ gen@@ ital mal@@ forma@@ tions of their babies ’ central nervous systems .
fi@@ ft@@ y-@@ six percent of those babies were born to poor women and women of color from northeast brazil .
clearly , the zi@@ ka crisis is not gen@@ der-@@ neutral .
in addressing its medi@@ um@@ - to long-term consequences , a focus on women – especially poor women – is needed .
that does not mean more media coverage of the de@@ for@@ mi@@ ties associated with micro@@ cephal@@ y or even of the difficulties faced by their mothers .
and it certainly does not mean more efforts to police women ’ s behavior .
to avoid infection , women have been advis@@ ed to use mosquito rep@@ ell@@ ent ; remove standing water around their homes ; wear long sle@@ ev@@ es ; and , if possible , use condoms or avoid sex .
the us center for disease control and prevention advis@@ ed pregnant women to refra@@ in from traveling to affected countries .
most extreme , health officials in el sal@@ v@@ ad@@ or and colom@@ bia ur@@ ged women not to get pregnant until 20@@ 18 .
such recommen@@ dations , however well intended they may be , are fundamentally fla@@ wed .
for star@@ ters , they emphasize short-@@ ter@@ m-@@ vector control and surveillance , while del@@ in@@ king the disease from the social and structural determin@@ ants of health , including public infrastructure such as running water , proper sanitation , and access to care .
they also place the responsibility for avoiding disease and pregnancy primarily on women , while failing to recognize the lack of control many women have over their bodies and preg@@ nan@@ cies .
many of the areas affected by zi@@ ka have high rates of sexual violence and teen pregnancy , a lack of sex education , and inadequate access to contra@@ cep@@ tives .
for these reasons , more than 50 % of preg@@ nan@@ cies in latin america are unintended .
making matters worse , in most latin american countries affected by zi@@ ka , abor@@ tion is illegal , or per@@ mitted only in exceptional situations .
for example , in el sal@@ v@@ ad@@ or , where more than 7,000 cases of zi@@ ka were reported between december 2015 and january 20@@ 16 , abor@@ tions are illegal under all circumstances .
mis@@ carri@@ ages , if proven to be self-@@ induced , can even lead to hom@@ i@@ cide convi@@ ctions .
the position of the united states hasn ’ t helped , either .
last year , us president barack obama ’ s administration asked congress for $ 1.@@ 8 billion in emergency funding to help prepare for and respond to the zi@@ ka threat .
but abor@@ tion politics interven@@ ed , as republican law@@ makers , leading a con@@ gressi@@ onal hearing on the zi@@ ka outbreak , made the funding condi@@ tional on anti-@@ abor@@ tion policies in recipi@@ ent countries .
the problems with the dominant approach to containing the zi@@ ka virus – namely , that it sa@@ dd@@ les women with too much responsibility while giving them too little power – are not lost on everyone .
last year , the united nations refugee agency and the world health organization emphasi@@ zed the need to put human rights at the center of the response to the zi@@ ka outbreak .
but , while high-@@ level recognition of women ’ s sexual and reproductive rights is a positive step , it is far from sufficient .
and doing what is needed to protect those rights , particularly among poor and vulnerable women in developing countries , will require deep and sustained political commitment .
in particular , national legislation must be re@@ vised to ensure that all women – whether they are carrying a baby with micro@@ cephal@@ y or not – have full reproductive autonomy .
women must be able to base their reproductive choices on their own physical and emotional needs and desires , not on the moral judgments of powerful agents or risk of criminal san@@ ctions .
advoc@@ acy groups in brazil , for example , are already pushing for such an outcome , sub@@ mit@@ ting legal cases to the supreme court to secure greater reproductive rights for women , including the right to safe and legal abor@@ tion .
those cases tend to lean on the 1988 national constitution , which guarante@@ es the right to abor@@ tion in case of rape , danger to the mother ’ s life , or an@@ en@@ cephal@@ y , another birth defe@@ ct involving the brain .
in pursuing these changes , campaigns should also recognize and address the links between women ’ s and disability rights .
indeed , they should advance equality for all margin@@ alized groups .
zi@@ ka ’ s medi@@ um@@ - and long-term consequences must be addressed with this in mind .
when a woman gives birth to a child with a con@@ gen@@ ital syndrome deri@@ ving from the zi@@ ka virus , the response should be grounded in the dignity , value , and rights of each individual .
it should acknowledge the processes that keep certain individuals and groups in poverty and that deny them the basic rights of citizens .
that is why campaig@@ ners must insist that the state be responsible for providing appropriate care and support services for each woman and child – services that both meet their needs and respect their rights .
zimbabwe &apos;s last chance
as the world rooted for former united nations secretary general kofi annan in his recent efforts to end the violence in kenya , many also found themselves wondering whether a we@@ ary annan , or some other global leader , will be bat@@ tling another fire by the end of this month : this time in zimbabwe .
zimbabwe ’ s up@@ coming elections , scheduled for march 29 , offer both fear and hope to the millions trapped in or trying to escape the country ’ s hel@@ lish conditions .
even official data now put the inflation rate at more than 100,000 % , and the p@@ light of ordinary zim@@ bab@@ we@@ ans grows more desperate by the day .
the elections could bring zim@@ bab@@ we@@ ans a chance to end the long dictator@@ ship of president robert mu@@ gabe .
but , without super@@ vision , they will be held in an environment that could d@@ ash zim@@ bab@@ we@@ ans ’ hopes .
zim@@ bab@@ we@@ ans are denied their basic freedoms and subje@@ cted to violence .
torture is widespread .
civil society groups report the arre@@ sts of opposition elec@@ toral candidates , the manipulation of food supplies for political purposes , and violent inci@@ dents of vot@@ er intimi@@ dation .
the zimbabwe election support network has also expressed concern about the country ’ s state of read@@ iness for this complex election , which will combine presidential , parli@@ am@@ entary , sen@@ atori@@ al , and local government con@@ tests .
and this is to say nothing of the structural faul@@ ts that continue to im@@ pe@@ de political progress – a defe@@ ctive constitution , censor@@ ed media , and a partisan security and military establishment .
it didn ’ t have to be this way .
south african president th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki conven@@ ed negotiations with zimbabwe ’ s political groups ; but they have been so un@@ fru@@ it@@ ful that opposition leaders recently all but accused m@@ be@@ ki of lying to the world about the progress of the talks .
some african leaders – not@@ ably ghana ’ s president , john ku@@ fu@@ or , and out@@ going african union head alpha kon@@ are – have tried to ca@@ jo@@ le mu@@ gabe towards reform , to no a@@ va@@ il .
perhaps more significantly , the international community ’ s failure to address zimbabwe seriously shows , once again , that it lac@@ ks the political will to prevent fores@@ ee@@ able crises .
last year , un secretary general ban ki@@ -@@ moon and un high commission@@ er for human rights louise arb@@ our con@@ dem@@ ned the regime ’ s use of torture and its mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment of pro-@@ democracy forces .
regre@@ tt@@ ably , the un failed to follow up with institutional action .
the un would say it must be invited into a country before it can take certain forms of action , such as sending official election obser@@ vers .
but it is also true that with adequate political will , the un security council could live up to its responsibility to zim@@ bab@@ we@@ ans by responding to the crisis more aggressi@@ vely .
the un should have put mu@@ gabe on the defen@@ sive with a for@@ ce@@ ful public offer to help zimbabwe prepare for internation@@ ally super@@ vised elections .
instead , the un continues to de@@ fer to mu@@ gabe , who hi@@ des behind claims of sovereig@@ n@@ ty while ja@@ iling a defen@@ sel@@ ess popul@@ ace .
with so many lives at stake , what can be done to aver@@ t an intensi@@ fication of the zimbabwe crisis ?
people of good will throughout the world , including those aff@@ ili@@ ated with multi@@ lat@@ eral organizations like the un , should desc@@ end on zimbabwe to observe this month ’ s elections .
ac@@ credi@@ ted or not , they should stand in solidar@@ ity with the people of zimbabwe at this crucial moment , act as witn@@ esses to the de@@ terior@@ ating pre-@@ election environment , and serve as a bul@@ war@@ k against any escal@@ ation of state bru@@ tality during and after the vote .
mu@@ gabe would prefer to limit the presence of international obser@@ vers to those sent by neighbor@@ ing states – the same allies that somehow managed to de@@ em the violent and frau@@ dul@@ ent elections of the past seven years “ legitimate . ”
zimbabwe ’ s neighbors also face a choice : they can use their prox@@ im@@ ity to halt mu@@ gabe ’ s ab@@ uses , or to shield him from international scru@@ tiny and re@@ bu@@ ke .
their choice may depend on what the world demands of them .
the people of zimbabwe will play their part on march 29 .
as for the regional and world community , their actions today and in the coming weeks could make the difference between a re@@ prise of the violence in kenya and the first step towards a more stable and democratic future .
hab@@ e@@ as cor@@ pus , latin for “ you have the body , ” is an old english common law principle incorpor@@ ated into the us constitution to ensure freedom from un@@ law@@ ful de@@ tention by the state .
it was and continues to be a critical check against the im@@ prison@@ ment of individuals without over@@ sight by independent courts .
in zimbabwe , this right – like so many other checks and balances – has been torn away by a repres@@ sive state .
just hours before the us supreme court rul@@ ing , ten@@ dai bit@@ i , the secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general of the opposition movement for democratic change ( m@@ dc ) , was arrested upon his return to zimbabwe .
despite immediate attempts by his lawyers to loc@@ ate him , his where@@ ab@@ outs remained unknown for days .
the police dis@@ missed an initial court order demanding that bit@@ i be produced before the court .
after bit@@ i was finally produced before the court days later , the government announced that he will be charged with treas@@ on – which carries the death penalty – for un@@ officially announcing the results of the march 29 , 2008 , elections . prior to his de@@ tention , bit@@ i had responded to such alle@@ ga@@ tions by stating that his only crime was to fight for democracy in zimbabwe .
it is unlikely that he will be able to challenge the basis of his de@@ tention in an independent court .
since 1999 , the m@@ dc has offered a democratic alternative to president robert mu@@ gabe ’ s regime .
in the most recent elections , zim@@ bab@@ we@@ ans made their choice known , despite serious obstacles and widespread repres@@ sion , with the m@@ dc ’ s presidential candidate , morgan ts@@ van@@ gira@@ i , gaining more votes than mu@@ gabe .
but , according to the vote counts released by the government after a suspicious month-@@ long delay , the m@@ dc ’ s margin of victory – 48 % to 43 % – fell short of the 50 % required to avoid a run@@ -@@ off election .
bit@@ i is not the only m@@ dc member to be “ disappeared ” for a period of time by mu@@ gabe ’ s government .
over the past two years , police and govern@@ ment-@@ supported param@@ ili@@ tar@@ ies have routinely ja@@ iled , beaten , and even killed m@@ dc officials and suspected m@@ dc members .
last year , bit@@ i was deta@@ ined and beaten along with ts@@ van@@ gira@@ i and dozens of other m@@ dc officials .
the photos of ts@@ van@@ gira@@ i ’ s pu@@ mm@@ eled body led to an international out@@ cry .
state-@@ sponsored violence against the m@@ dc and its suppor@@ ters has escal@@ ated as the june 27 run@@ -@@ off vote draws near . just weeks ago , bit@@ i described the discovery of the mu@@ til@@ ated body of t@@ onder@@ ai n@@ di@@ ra , an m@@ dc youth leader .
n@@ di@@ ra had been taken by the police from his home .
he was missing for seven days ; when his body was found , it was recogni@@ zable only by a bra@@ cele@@ t he always wore .
here in our offices in johan@@ nes@@ burg , we have two zim@@ bab@@ we@@ an lawyers who fl@@ ed their country after receiving death threats for their work defending human rights .
at least five of their clients have been murdered in the past few weeks .
most recently , the zim@@ bab@@ we@@ an police suspended the work of numerous human rights organizations that were documenting the recent violence .
it is hard to imagine that a free and fair election can take place against the back@@ drop of such intense and systemic violence .
indeed , even south african president th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki , who , despite an out@@ cry from many of his citizens , has supported mu@@ gabe , felt comp@@ elled to label it a “ cause for serious concern . ”
in the majority opinion in bou@@ medi@@ ene v. bush , justice anthony kennedy wrote that “ liberty and security can be re@@ conc@@ iled ; and in our system they are re@@ conc@@ iled within the framework of the law . ” but there is no rule of law left in zimbabwe – no hab@@ e@@ as cor@@ pus and no check on arbitrary state action .
it is time for the international community to step in , call for an end to the de@@ tention and disappe@@ ar@@ ance of m@@ dc officials and perceived suppor@@ ters , and push for a democratic transition in zimbabwe .
only then can the principles underlying the supreme court ’ s decision come within reach of ordinary zim@@ bab@@ we@@ ans .
johan@@ nes@@ burg – morgan ts@@ van@@ gira@@ i ’ s with@@ dra@@ wal from the presidential run@@ -@@ off scheduled for june 27 , and his decision to seek the protection of the dutch embassy in pre@@ tor@@ ia , has secu@@ red for zimbabwe ’ s president robert mu@@ gabe a py@@ rr@@ hic victory .
the actions of the mu@@ gabe regime in the run@@ -up to ts@@ van@@ gira@@ i ’ s decision demand a strong regional response to what is clearly a stolen victory . indeed , mu@@ gabe ’ s continuing in power represents the most serious challenge to africa ’ s nas@@ cent democratic institutions and to south africa ’ s vision of a continent of peace and prosperity .
after con@@ testing every election since 2000 , ts@@ van@@ gira@@ i ’ s movement for democratic change ( m@@ dc ) has changed tactics reluct@@ antly .
under the circumstances , south africa and the southern african development community ( sad@@ c ) ur@@ gently need to re@@ app@@ raise their approach not only to mu@@ gabe , but to how they will deal with any un@@ con@@ tested election .
a host of declar@@ ations adopted over the years by the sad@@ c and the african union address the conduct of elections on the continent .
these include the sad@@ c principles and guidelines gover@@ ning democratic elections ( 2004 ) , the african charter on democracy , elections , and governance ( 2007 ) , and the declar@@ ation on the principles gover@@ ning democratic elections in africa ( 2002 ) .
none of these principles have been respected in zimbabwe , and regional leaders have not c@@ ited their viol@@ ation as reason to cen@@ sure mu@@ gabe ’ s government .
unfortunately , we have a recent prece@@ dent for this type of behavior : kenya ’ s rul@@ ers , too , ignored and twisted the rule of law and the integrity of the elec@@ toral process , rel@@ ying on violence to secure a political outcome that their fellow citizens denied them .
dealing effectively with political inst@@ ability in africa requires two things : the political will of key states to under@@ write the democratic process , and strong regional institutions to provide a legal framework reflecting the principles under@@ pinn@@ ing states ’ behavior . the effectiveness of regional institutions and the role of regional powers are inter@@ linked .
regional institutions can ent@@ ren@@ ch themselves only if their members promote ad@@ her@@ ence to the spirit and letter of their legal frame@@ works .
in both cases , south africa – the main regional power with the most levers of influence over zimbabwe – has a vital role to play .
but does south africa really see itself as a regional power ?
its handling of mu@@ gabe over the past eight years has actually under@@ played its leverage .
yet the man@@ tle of a regional power sometimes requires using that leverage for the greater good of the region .
what should south africa do now ?
should president th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki step down as medi@@ ator in the zimbabwe crisis , not because he has failed , but to remove from south africa the constraints that being a medi@@ ator put in place ?
south africa has a vest@@ ed interest in stability , and it can turn the scre@@ ws on mu@@ gabe ’ s regime , much as it has refused to contemp@@ late any form of san@@ ctions because of their impact on the poor .
south africa must tap into the growing concern among zimbabwe ’ s neighbors ( angola , botswana , tanzania , and zambia ) about the political crisis , and for@@ ge a united front within the sad@@ c that sends a clear message to mu@@ gabe and his gener@@ als that the region will no longer tolerate their actions .
the sad@@ c should not end@@ or@@ se the regime ’ s claim of victory in an un@@ con@@ tested election .
it must insist that all opposition leaders and suppor@@ ters be fre@@ ed immediately , and that all state-@@ sponsored violence be hal@@ ted .
it should dis@@ patch an em@@ in@@ ent persons ’ group of senior african and other international leaders to zimbabwe , as well as peace monit@@ ors to ensure that the government comp@@ lies with these demands .
the sad@@ c ’ s cen@@ sure of mu@@ gabe and his regime should be backed up by concrete actions , such as restri@@ ctions on all arms flows to zimbabwe , travel restri@@ ctions on senior officials of zimbabwe ’ s rul@@ ing z@@ an@@ u-@@ pf party , and the threat of property sei@@ zur@@ es and the freezing of financial assets in the region and beyond .
m@@ be@@ ki and other sad@@ c leaders should recognize a key point . according to legal opinions commissioned by the southern african li@@ ti@@ gation center , zimbabwe ’ s elec@@ toral act holds that the delay or absence of a law@@ ful run@@ -@@ off means that the candidate who obtained the most votes in the election of march 29 , 2008 , has been du@@ ly elected as president .
moreover , south africa was instru@@ mental in dra@@ fting the declar@@ ation on un@@ constitu@@ tional changes of government , adopted by the organization of african unity , the au ’ s pre@@ de@@ cess@@ or , in 1999 .
the manner in which the elec@@ toral process in zimbabwe has been conducted since march has been an un@@ constitu@@ tional continu@@ ation of government .
the declar@@ ation clearly sti@@ pul@@ ates that an in@@ cum@@ bent government ’ s ref@@ us@@ al to rel@@ in@@ qu@@ ish power to the winning party after free , fair , and regular elections is un@@ constitu@@ tional .
if south africa sees itself as speaking for africa on the global stage and creating a vision for the continent ’ s future , it must know when to lead and how to build consensus .
none of this is easy , but south africa must now act decisi@@ vely in order to polish its tar@@ nis@@ hed image as a responsible regional power . “ business as usual ” is no longer a viable approach for south african foreign policy .
zo@@ elli@@ ck to the rescue ?
will newly an@@ o@@ in@@ ted world bank president robert zo@@ elli@@ ck be able to get the organization back on its feet after the catastrophic failed pres@@ iden@@ cy of paul wol@@ fo@@ witz ?
although hardly a megawatt star of the bob ru@@ bin category , he certainly brings some positive attributes to the job .
first , as a key player in bringing china into the world trade organization , zo@@ elli@@ ck is a proven internation@@ alist in an american administration where internation@@ alists have sometimes seemed like an endangered species .
second , he is a firm belie@@ ver in the power of markets and free trade , which have clearly done far more to alle@@ vi@@ ate poverty over the past half-@@ century than any aid program .
third , he seems to have been a consistent be@@ hin@@ d-@@ the-@@ scenes suppor@@ ter of the bank , whereas many of his bush administration colleagues would be just as happy to see it shut down and its washington headquarters turned into private con@@ domini@@ ums and offices .
so presumably he has a construc@@ tive vision for the bank ’ s future .
but zo@@ elli@@ ck is not without his weak@@ nesses .
first and foremost , his appointment exten@@ ds the embarras@@ sing@@ ly out@@ mo@@ ded practice of always inst@@ alling an american in the job .
with the bank ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly pre@@ aching the mer@@ its of good governance , its failure to adopt democratic principles under@@ cuts its own legiti@@ macy .
the claim that the world bank needs an american president to ensure that the us keeps don@@ ating money is ridiculous .
the annual cost of the us contribution to the world bank , even taking into account off-@@ the-@@ books loan guarante@@ es , is relatively minor .
any number of developing countries , from china to india to brazil , could easily step up if the us fo@@ oli@@ sh@@ ly stepped down .
zo@@ elli@@ ck ’ s background as a lawyer hardly makes him perfect for the job , either .
the world bank pres@@ iden@@ cy is not about negotiating treaties , as zo@@ elli@@ ck did when he was us trade representative .
the bank ’ s most important role in development today is as a “ knowledge bank ” that helps aggregate , di@@ still , and dissemin@@ ate best practices from around the world .
in this respect , the bank ’ s technical assistance to governments is very similar to what private consul@@ tants offer to companies .
moreover , many of the world bank president ’ s most important decisions involve economics in an essential way .
wrong economic decisions , such as in the 1970 ’ s , when robert mc@@ nam@@ ara pushed gran@@ dio@@ se , but environmentally devastating , infrastructure projects , have ha@@ unted the bank for decades .
the biggest question mark , though , is whether zo@@ elli@@ ck will be able to hit the ground running and implement desperately needed reforms .
reform number one , of course , is to ensure that the next world bank president is not an american .
rodri@@ go de ra@@ to , zo@@ elli@@ ck ’ s counter@@ part at the europe@@ an-@@ dominated international mon@@ etary fund , has already suggested that his success@@ or should be chosen in a more inclusive process .
the world bank should be ashamed that its president has not yet offered a similar proposal .
second , zo@@ elli@@ ck should ask why the bank spends only 2.5 % of its budget on the “ knowledge bank ” research function that it trum@@ pets so prou@@ dly in its external relations materials , while it spends three times that amount on maintaining its executive board .
third , zo@@ elli@@ ck should use his for@@ mid@@ able negotiating skills to ca@@ jo@@ le rich countries into greatly increasing the grant component of world bank aid .
the idea that a big govern@@ ment-@@ guaranteed global bank is needed to fill holes in private capital markets is lau@@ g@@ hable nowadays .
true , the bank ’ s poorest clients have little access to private capital markets . by and large , however , the poorest countries need gr@@ ants , not loans that they still won ’ t be able to pay in 20 years .
as the bank switches from loans to gr@@ ants , it can use some of its massive re@@ tained ear@@ nings to en@@ dow its “ knowledge bank ” function and related technical advice .
but all this knowledge shouldn ’ t be free .
a lot of technical advice falls on deaf ears , with countries listening only long enough to get their hands on bank money .
instead of merely pushing its agenda , the bank should start charging for its technical advice on a graduated scale so that more of its enga@@ ge@@ ments are cli@@ ent-@@ driven .
last but not least , the bank needs to play a much bigger role in environmental issues and , in general , in promoting good international citizenship by both rich and poor countries .
( some of us have been proposing this for almost two decades . )
of course , zo@@ elli@@ ck could just attempt to fill the role symbo@@ lic@@ ally and do little or nothing , as some of his pre@@ de@@ cess@@ ors have done .
or , less likely , he could embrace some me@@ gal@@ om@@ ani@@ ac@@ al and over-@@ reaching vision of government intervention , as others have tried .
in any case , let ’ s wish him luck .
the world needs the world bank a lot more than it needs another con@@ domini@@ um .
zu@@ ma rising
the anxiety over jac@@ ob zu@@ ma ’ s election as president of south africa obsc@@ ures a significant mile@@ stone : for the first time in decades , a sub-saharan nation has at its helm a champion of ordinary people .
african politics has long been the exclusive domain of ari@@ sto@@ crats , soldiers , and techno@@ crats .
even with the spread of democratic elections , the region ’ s leaders tend to come from the ran@@ ks of soldiers ( uganda , rwanda , zimbabwe ) , family dy@@ na@@ sti@@ es ( to@@ go , kenya , etc ) , or university professors , lawyers , and economists ( ghana , malawi , liberia ) .
now south africa , the region ’ s economic engine and home to its most sophisticated universities , media , and corporations , has a former goat her@@ der at its helm , a rare african leader with the common touch .
zu@@ ma is legendary for his ability to connect with ordinary people .
he ’ s secure enough to dance and sing in public . he speaks the language of popu@@ li@@ sm , raising hopes for the vast majority of south africans who daily end@@ ure the misery of poor housing , schools , and health care .
until now , popu@@ li@@ sm has been the missing note in african political culture .
yet , while zu@@ ma ’ s popu@@ list appeal reflects south africa ’ s especially large differences in economic class , the threat of im@@ posing higher taxes and other obli@@ ga@@ tions on emplo@@ yers and the wealthy has raised fears at home and internation@@ ally .
moreover , zu@@ ma has been called a cham@@ ele@@ on , accused of telling his audiences what they want to hear .
zu@@ ma ’ s turbul@@ ent personal life – many wives and his embarrassing con@@ tention during a rape trial that he avoi@@ ded hiv infection by taking a shower – has invited ridi@@ cule .
most seriously , doub@@ ts persist about his commitment to democracy , with cri@@ tics arguing he ’ s an old-@@ style african “ big man ” ready to bul@@ ly oppon@@ ents and ra@@ vage the public co@@ ff@@ ers with his cr@@ onies .
dis@@ missing compla@@ ints , zu@@ ma insi@@ sts , “ there ’ s no cloud around me . ”
his defen@@ ders , meanwhile , point to two benefits that he has already delivered : an end to m@@ be@@ ki ’ s ambi@@ valent approach to fighting hiv / aids , the country ’ s major public health threat , and a re@@ fres@@ hing willingness to move against zimbabwe ’ s aged dictator , robert mu@@ gabe , whom m@@ be@@ ki co@@ ddled out of a mis@@ guided sense of loyalty for his support during the struggle against apartheid .
in an africa bere@@ ft of successful popu@@ list politicians , zu@@ ma ’ s role models may come from latin america , where income inequality is also extreme and the trade-@@ union movement , as in south africa , is strong and milit@@ ant .
with enormous pressure from ordinary people to deliver tangible gains , zu@@ ma the popu@@ list will quickly face a major test : will he emu@@ late l@@ ula of brazil , who has struck an ad@@ mir@@ able balance between good economic governance and re-@@ distribution of wealth to the poor ?
or will he follow the path of hu@@ go ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z , a popular auto@@ crat who seems to prefer building a cult of personality over raising living standards for the poor .
the stakes for africa are enormous .
south africa has the continent ’ s largest economy and , until the global financial crisis , posted 10 years of steady economic growth .
in an economic slow@@ down , the country ’ s severe crime problem might only wor@@ sen ; so might unemployment , which already tops 20 % in the formal economy .
zu@@ ma senses the urgency of the situation .
he is , after all , 67 years old and likely to serve only a single term in office . “ we can ’ t waste time , ” he says .
yet , according to the political economist mo@@ el@@ et@@ si m@@ be@@ ki , at his core , “ zu@@ ma is a conservative . ” in this sense , zu@@ ma represents yesterday ’ s south africa .
he is part of the proud generation that defeated apartheid – and then peac@@ efully engineered a transition to durable black-@@ majority rule .
their achievement remains one of the greatest in recent history .
at the same time , zu@@ ma ’ s revolutionary generation still seems un@@ easy leading south africa in a post-@@ apartheid era that is now 15 years old .
in a region that rever@@ es the elderly , zu@@ ma ’ s attachment to his rural traditions must be matched by an equal openness to the appeti@@ tes of the country ’ s youth .
three in ten south africans are younger than 15 , meaning that they did not live a day under apartheid .
somehow zu@@ ma must find a way to honor his own generation ’ s commitment to racial justice and national liberation , while empowering the masses who daily suffer the sting of class differences and year@@ n for material gain .
